ABSTRACT
Modern trade models attribute the dispersion of international prices to physical and man-made barriers
to trade, to the pricing-to-market by heterogeneous producers and to differences in the quality of output
offered by firms. This paper presents a tractable general equilibrium model that incorporates all three
of these mechanisms. Our model allows us to confront Chinese firm-level data on the prices charged
and revenues earned within and across markets. We show that all three mechanisms are necessary
to fit the distribution of prices and revenues across firms and markets. Accounting for endogenous
quality heterogeneity across firms and markets is shown to be critical for the response of prices to
trade and tariff shocks.

Introduction

The literature on quantitative general equilibrium models has blossomed in recent years. The
popularity of these models is driven by their simplicity, by their ease of calibration, and by their
flexibility to be adapted for the analysis of the impact of a wide variety of policies. Further, as
shown by Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz (2011) these models can successfully confront firm-level
microdata on the distribution of sales within and across countries. One feature of the microdata
that has received less attention in the development of quantitative general equilibrium models
is the joint distribution of firm-level prices and sales within and across countries. As has been
shown in existing descriptive work (e.g. Manova and Zhang, 2012), firms from a given source
country charge very different prices across countries.
In this paper we develop a simple quantitative general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms that has been designed to confront the joint distribution of firm-level prices and
sales. Variations in prices within-firm, across-country stem from the interaction between trade
costs that vary between countries, firms’ decisions to price-to-market, and firms’ endogenous
provision of goods of different quality to different countries. Our model includes all three of
these features. With respect to trade cost, we explicitly allow for both standard iceberg (advalorem) trade costs and specific (fixed per unit) trade costs. This is natural because both
types of trade costs are likely to be a feature of the constraints facing exporters in the real
world and because the interaction between the two types of trade costs has been shown to
affect the quality decision of firms (Hummels and Skiba, 2004).
We also allow firms to choose the quality of goods that they provide to each market that
they serve. We assume that the marginal cost of production is increasing in output quality and
decreasing in firm productivity. Because specific trade costs are not increasing in the quality
of goods sold, firms can lower their cost of serving markets with high specific trade costs by
upgrading quality, and the incentive to do this is rising in a firm’s productivity because these
firms sell the largest number of units. Hence, our specification delivers a “Washington-Apples”
effect that varies in strength across both countries and firms and so provides a mechanism to
fit the joint distribution of prices and revenues.1
With respect to pricing-to-market, we follow Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019) by
assuming CES-like preferences that have been generalized to allow for an endogenous “choke
price”. Firms in our model first minimize quality-adjusted marginal costs and then set qualityadjusted prices to maximize profits in each market that they serve. While the correlation
between quality-adjusted prices and quality-adjusted revenue will be negative due to the optimal markup choices of the firm, the correlation between observed (unadjusted) prices and
(unadjusted) revenues will be positive as in the data.
Combining firm heterogeneity, endogenous quality, and pricing-to-market all together, our

Our formulation adapts Feenstra and Romalis (2014) to be more in line with the initial formulation in
Hummels and Skiba (2004). Feenstra and Romalis (2014) do not adapt their mechanism to confront firm-level
data.

simple model generates rich predictions regarding across-firm and across-country price variations. Qualitatively, our model is consistent with a well documented range of facts regarding
the joint distribution of prices across firms and across countries. Further, the model can capture
the positive relationship in the data between a firm’s price and the its revenue. More importantly, the key contribution of our model is the parsimonious and highly tractable framework
which allows us to conduct a quantitative general equilibrium analysis.
Our paper also has novel implications for the estimation of gravity equations. A large class
of models generates gravity equations in which the elasticity of trade flows with respect to
trade costs reveals key structural parameters (Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare, 2012;
Arkolakis et al., 2019). Our model also generates a gravity equation in which the appropriate
measure of trade costs is the geometric average of specific and iceberg trade costs where the
weights reflect the elasticity of marginal cost with respect to quality. In standard models a
common way to estimate the trade elasticity using tariffs, which are generally ad-valorem, as
a measure of trade costs (e.g. Head and Mayer, 2014). In our framework with specific trade
costs, this calibration strategy necessarily leads to an underestimate of the key macro elasticity.
We calibrate our model to aggregate trade flows (gravity) and to the joint distribution of firmcountry level price and sales from Chinese customs data.
Our model also contributes to our understanding of the response of prices to trade cost
shocks. Much recent work analyzes the markup responses of firms to changes in trade policy
(e.g. De Loecker et al., 2016; Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger, 2019). In our setting, shocks
to trade costs affect firm-level prices through multiple mechanisms. On the one hand, firms
respond to any shock to quality-adjusted marginal costs by changing their markups. On the
other hand, firms also adjust the quality of their output and this induces a price response as
quality-adjusted marginal costs change.
To illustrate the potential for quality adjustment to be confused for adjustment in markups,
we consider a comparative static exercise in which we alternatively shock specific and iceberg
trade costs to each Chinese trading partner by enough to lower trade by 5 percent. These
shocks have equivalent welfare effects but generate very different price responses. Because
increases in specific trade costs induce firms to raise their quality, they lead to exaggerated
price increases, whereas shocks to ad valorem trade costs induce firms to lower the quality of
the goods they provide and so lead to small changes in prices. Hence, the model demonstrates
the need to know the nature of trade shocks before making predictions over the associated price
changes.2 This is important as it shows how micro-econometric models that neglect specific
trade costs may be misspecified.
Our paper contributes to two strands of the literature that seek to understand the causes
and implications of international prices. First, our focus on endogenous quality puts our paper
into a literature that includes the recent paper by Feenstra and Romalis (2014) who provide
2

On a related note, variations in prices across countries are occasionally used to measure trade costs. If
bilateral trade costs vary in their mixture of specific and ad valorem costs, much of the observed differences in
prices would be due to quality upgrading rather than absolute levels of trade costs.

a monopolistic competition model that has been designed to estimate the quality of goods
traded and sold domestically with the intention of purging price indices of quality variation
across countries. As the authors are working with country-level data, they do not develop their
model to confront the joint distribution of firm-level prices and sales, which is the focus of our
paper.3
Our paper also contributes to the literature featuring variable markups. These papers
include Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019) and Atkeson and Burstein (2008). As in Jung,
Simonovska and Weinberger (2019), we consider non-homothetic preferences and a market
structure that gives rise to variable markups across firms. Relative to their paper, we also
consider vertically differentiated products, quality upgrading opportunities, and specific trade
costs that give rise to the “Washington Apples” effect. Our framework, therefore, allows for
much of the variation across countries and firms to be attributed not to variation in market
power but to variation in quality of output. Allowing for quality upgrading helps to make the
model with variable markups more consistent with the well-known pattern in the data that
the most successful exporters tend to charge the highest prices (e.g. Manova and Zhang, 2012;
Harrigan, Ma and Shlychkov, 2015). Moreover, our framework highlights the differential effect
of specific and ad valorem trade costs on the international distribution of prices.
In the literature, models that feature firm heterogeneity, endogenous quality, and variable
markups are rare. An important exception is Antoniades (2015) who embeds endogenous
quality into the model of Melitz-Ottaviano (Melitz and Ottaviano, 2008). The focus of the
Antoniades’s model is on the role of market size and scale economies in driving endogeneous
quality and so it lacks the “Washington Apples” mechanism that is our focus. Nevertheless,
the model presented in Antoniades (2015) generates a rich set of predictions that can be
qualitatively consistent with many of the facts presented in our paper. The Antoniades paper
does not confront its model with the data, however, and doing so would be difficult given the
complex interaction in the model of its parameters and endogenous variables.
Finally, our paper is also related to the recent work by Hottman, Redding and Weinstein
(2016) who allow for both market power and quality heterogeneity to drive price dispersion
across local prices in the United States. They find that a very substantial portion of heterogeneity in market shares can be attributed to quality heterogeneity but with firms’ strategic
pricing decisions also playing a non-trivial role. By considering a more parsimonious setting,
we can conduct an analysis of the role of markup and quality dispersions to an international
setting. In addition, we follow Arkolakis et al. (2019) and derive a sufficient-statistic-type
welfare formula for the gains from trade with the presence of both endogenous quality and
variable markups.
The remainder of this paper is organized into six sections. In Section 2, we develop a series
3

The literature on quality differences across countries is very rich. Earlier contributions include Schott
(2004), Kugler and Verhoogen (2009, 2012), Khandelwal (2010), Baldwin and Harrigan (2011), Manova and
Zhang (2012), Johnson (2012), Bas and Strauss-Kahn (2015), Harrigan, Ma and Shlychkov (2015), and Fan, Li
and Yeaple (2015, 2018).

of stylized facts concerning the international pricing behavior of Chinese firms that we will use
to calibrate our model. In Section 3, we present a simple, quantitative general equilibrium
model that is able to rationalize these stylized facts and that can be quantified with features of
our data. In Section 4, we describe how we solve, calibrate and simulate our benchmark model.
In Section 5, we assess the model’s fit to the data, and derive an expression for the welfare
gains from trade shocks to show the model’s quantitative implications for the gains from trade.
In Section 6, we illustrate how specific and ad valorem trade shocks that have identical effects
on welfare and on trade volumes have very different effects on prices. Finally, in Section 7, we
provide concluding comments.

Stylized Facts

In this section, we present a series of facts that suggest the need for a model that incorporates firm heterogeneity, variable markups, and endogenous quality in order to understand the
distribution of prices across firms and markets.

2.1

Data

To document the stylized facts regarding export prices across destinations and across firms
within the same destination, we use two micro-level databases and one aggregate-level crosscountry database. Specifically, these are (1) the transaction-level export data from China’s
General Administration of Customs; (2) the annual survey of industrial firms from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC); (3) the CEPII Gravity database that provides
destination countries’ characteristics such as population, GDP per capita, and distance to
China. We use data for the year 2004 to be consistent with the calibration exercise later.4
The China’s Customs database records each export and import transaction for the universe
of Chinese firms at the HS8 product level, including values, quantities, products, source and
destination countries, firm contacts (e.g., company name, telephone, zip code, and contact
person), enterprise types (e.g., state owned, domestic private, foreign invested, or joint venture),
and customs regimes (e.g., ordinary trade, or processing trade). We aggregate each transactionlevel data to various levels, including firm-HS6-destination country, firm-HS6, or HS6-country
for further analysis. We compute unit values (i.e., export values divided by export quantities)
as a proxy for export prices and focus on ordinary trade exporters.5
To characterize firms’ attributes such as TFP, employment, capital intensity, and wage,
we use the NBSC firm-level data from the annual surveys of Chinese industrial firms. This
4

To calibrate our model, we construct bilateral trade shares following the method in Ossa (2014) based on
GTAP 9 Data Base for the year 2004 (see Section 4 for more details).
5
Processing traders have very little control over the prices that they receive for their goods and are often the
affiliates of foreign firms who directly control the prices in transactions. This is the key reason that processing
traders are excluded from this analysis.

5

database contains detailed firm-level production, accounting and firm identification information
for all state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises with annual sales of at
least 5 million Renminbi (RMB, Chinese currency). We use merged data of both the Customs
data and the NBSC firm survey data when firms’ characteristics are needed.6

2.2

Empirical Regularities

In this subsection, we report several stylized facts concerning export prices across destinations
and across firms within destination as well as the number of firms that export to each destination.7 As we argue below, to be consistent with all of these facts requires a model that
incorporates both variable markups and quality heterogeneity to understand the distribution
of prices across firms.
We begin with two sets of facts that suggest that competition is lower in developed countries
and that lower competition induces firms to charge high markups and to allow relatively less
competitive firms to enter the market.

to delete the unsatisfactory observations in the NBSC database. See Fan, Li and Yeaple (2015) for more detailed
description of data and the merging process.

The existing literature has documented many of these facts separately. We present them here to show that
they also hold in the Chinese data and to refresh readers’ memories as to the features of the distribution of
prices across markets and firms.

and destination country’s GDP per capita, its population, and its distance to China. Columns
1-2 and 3-4 use the prices at the firm-HS6-country level and the HS6-country level, respectively.
The coefficients on GDP per capita in all specifications are positive and statistically significant,
indicating that export prices increase in destination’s income (e.g., Manova and Zhang, 2012).
To better control for country-level characteristics, we include the destination country’s GDP
per capita in columns 1 and 3, while in columns 2 and 4, we further control for population
and distance. Comparing odd columns with even columns, we find that adding population and
distance would not affect our results qualitatively.8
In Figure 1, we plot the mean residuals of each destination from regressing log export prices
on product fixed effects and log destination GDP per capita as well as destination’s population
and distance. The data reveal a positive relationship between export prices and destination
income.
Fact 2: A larger number of firms export to developed countries.— We now turn to the
number of exporting firms in different destinations. Table 2 reports the results of regressing
the logarithm of the number of firms that export to each HS6-country (in columns 1-2) and
8

The coefficient on distance is significantly positive. This result is consistent with the “Washington Apple”
effect of Hummels and Skiba (2004). As for population, the regression based on the data presents a significantly
positive coefficient on population. A reasonable interpretation of this result is that large populations are
associated with greater competition and that this induces firms to upgrade the quality of goods sold in those
markets (Antoniades, 2015).

specifications (3)-(4) is the (log) price at the firm-HS6 level. Firm-level other
controls include employment, capital-labor ratio, and wage. All regressions

Fact 3: More productive firms charge higher export prices.— To present export prices across
firms, we use the merged data of the customs and the NBSC in 2004 in Table 3 and report
the results obtained by regressing export prices on firm productivity, and other firm-level
controls, such as employment, capital intensity, and the wage it pays. The measure of firm
productivity is revenue based TFP, estimated by the augmented Olley-Pakes’ (Olley and Pakes,
1996) approach by allowing a firm’s trade status and the WTO shock in the TFP realization,
as in Amiti and Konings (2007).9 In columns 1-2, we use firm-HS6-country level price and
include product-country fixed effect; in columns 3-4, we use firm-HS6 price and include HS6
product fixed effect. We do not control for employment, capital intensity and wage in columns
1 and 3, while in columns 2 and 4 we add those firm-level controls to show the robustness
of our regression results. The coefficient on firm’s TFP are all significantly positive, which
is consistent with the quality-and-trade literature that high-productivity firms charge higher
prices (e.g., Fan, Li and Yeaple, 2015). Figure 3 also plots export prices against firm’s TFP
by regressing firm-HS6 level export prices on HS6 product fixed effects and then plotting the
mean residuals for each firm.
Table 3 and figure 3 show that more productive firms charge higher prices. It is also true
that they earn higher revenues in each market as well so that the correlation between firms’
export revenues and their export prices is positive (See Table 7 and Figure 6 later in the text).

2.3

Discussion

The facts presented in this section suggest several mechanisms are necessary to understand the
distribution of prices. Facts 1 and 2 suggest that developed countries are systematically less
competitive than less developed countries. Prices are higher there within firm-product, and
this suggests that markups are higher there. Second, the number of firms that can survive in
richer markets suggests a lower level of competition. In models with variable markups, this
would be due to a higher choke price. Fact 3, however, suggests a need for quality heterogeneity
as well. Larger, more productive firms charge higher prices and this is consistent with quality
upgrading on their part. Further, some of the gradient in prices charged in richer markets may
be due to higher quality goods being sold there. Finally, the results of Hummels and Skiba
(2004) strongly argue for the need to incorporate quality variation in order to understand the
“Washington Apples” effect. We now layout a simple model that can capture these facts.

Model

In this section, we introduce and solve our model. We first introduce the demand side of the
model and solve for the optimal markup as a function of a firm’s quality of output and marginal
cost of production. We then endogenize quality choice and characterize a firm’s decision to

enter into a given market as a function of its heterogeneous cost draws. Third, we solve for the
implied aggregate variables and close the model with labor market clearing/trade balance.

3.1

Tastes and Endowments

Consider a world populated by J countries, indexed by i and j with country j endowed with Lj
units of labor. The preferences of the representative consumer in each country are identical but
are non-homothetic leading to different marginal valuations of quality and access to variety.
Specifically, we extend the preference system considered by Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger
(2019) augmented such that varieties vary in their perceived quality. We denote the source
country by i and the destination country by j. Consumers in country j have access to a set
of goods Ωj , which is potentially different across countries. Specifically, the representative
consumer has preferences of:

where σ > 1 is the elasticity of substitution, xcij (ω) is the quantity of variety ω from country

constant.
Utility maximization imples that the demand curve for variety ω is given by:

To simplify our discussion and to keep our notation compact, we define the quality-adjusted

We thus can write quantity, sales, and profit for a given variety exported from i to j as

where c̃ij (ω) = cij (ω) /qij (ω) is the quality-adjusted marginal cost and cij (ω) is the marginal
cost of production. Given the quality-adjusted marginal cost, firms maximize their profits.
Taking as given the pricing behavior of all other firms, the monopolistically competitive
producer of variety ω chooses its quality-adjusted price of the good. The first-order condition
for profit maximization implicitly yields the optimal price p̃ij (ω) which satisfies:

Note that the optimal prices and optimal profits depend only on the quality-adjusted marginal
cost of production. In the next subsection, we endogenize a firm’s choice of its quality-adjusted
marginal cost of production.

3.2

Quality and Production

Firms are heterogeneous in productivity ϕ. Following Feenstra and Romalis (2014), for a firm
from country i with productivity ϕ requires l of labor produce one unit of output with quality
q according to the production function:
l=

qη
,
ϕ

where η > 1 is a measure of the scope for quality differentiation. In addition, a firm from
country i that wishes to sell its product in country j must incur two types of variable shipping
costs. The first, τij ≥ 1, is the standard iceberg-type shipping cost which requires τij units to
be shipped for one unit to arrive. The second, Tij , is a per-unit shipping cost (a specific trade
cost). For simplicity, we assume that specific trade costs are in terms of country i labor.
For a firm from country i of productivity ϕ that has received country j’s idiosyncratic cost
shock ε, the marginal cost of supply one unit of quality qij to country j is


wi τij η
cij (ϕ, ε) = Tij wi +
q
ε
ϕ ij
where τij is ad valorem trade cost and Tij is a specific transportation cost from country i to

Hence, the quality adjusted marginal cost of production is given by


(7)

As will be obvious in a moment when solving for optimal quality choice by firm this formulation
has several desirable features. First, it will exhibit the “Washington Apples” effect: higher
specific trade costs will induce firms to upgrade their quality. Second, it will be consistent
with the well documented fact that more productive firms charge higher prices (e.g. Kugler
and Verhoogen (2009), Manova and Zhang (2012)). Third, it will prove to be highly tractable,
allowing us to avoid the tractability issues that have prevented quality and variable markups
analysis in the past.
From the first-order condition associated with equation (7), the optimal level of quality for
a firm with productivity ϕ is
 η1

Tij ϕ
qij (ϕ, ε) =
(8)
(η − 1) τij
and hence the quality adjusted marginal cost of supplying market j from i could be rewritten:

(9)

It is immediate from this expression that more productive firms produce higher quality
goods but actually face lower quality-adjusted costs. Also the quality-adjusted cost is an
increasing geometric average of both types of shipping costs with the weights driven by η. As
η goes to one, specific trade costs matter not at all and our model becomes the model given
by Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019). As η goes to infinity, however, firm productivity
becomes complete irrelevant and the weight of the specific trade cost goes to one. As a result,
the more costly it is to upgrade quality (higher η) the less quality-adjusted marginal cost is
decreasing in firm productivity. Hence, specific trade costs hit the most productive firms more
heavily than the less productive.
Equation (3) implies that consumer does not have positive demand for goods with sufficiently high quality-adjusted prices. The quality adjusted price p̃ij can not exceeds the choke
price, p̃∗j . At the cutoff, equations (3) and (6) imply:
p̃∗ij (ϕ, ε) = c̃∗ij (ϕ, ε) = p̃∗j

(10)

where p̃∗ij (ϕ, ε) and c̃∗ij (ϕ, ε) are the quality adjusted price and the quality adjusted marginal
cost at the entry threshold, ϕ∗ij (ε). Hence, the previous equation, together with equation (9),

13

imply that the productivity cutoff ϕ∗ij (ε) to sell goods from country i to country j satisfies:

Figure 4: Illustration of Model Mechanism

Low Income
High Income

Figure 4 illustrates that the relationship of the quality-adjusted export price, export price,
export quality and export markup with firm’s productivity within and across countries.10 The
blue solid line represents this relationship in the low-income destination country; the red, thicker
line denotes it in the high-income destination country. In Panel C of Figure 4, we depict the
positive relationship between price and productivity. Since markups over marginal cost vary
systematically with market characteristics, both the quality-adjusted export price, and absolute
export price are higher in higher-income country. This is due to the higher markups that can
be charged in richer markets.11 If firms set constant markups over marginal costs, then there
10

Note that Figure 4 is an illustration based on simulation because we do not have explicit expression for
price and markup as function of productivity under CES, but we can derive explicit expressions under log
utility function (see Appendix B).
11
It is straightforward to show that when there is a portion of the cost of the specific trade cost incurred in the
destination country, then richer countries would also be purchasing higher quality goods than poor countries.

14

would be no correlation between price and productivity since per-unit costs do not depend on
firm productivity. Hence, the variable markups generate the positive relationship between price
and productivity. The magnitude of this positive relationship depends on the values of quality
scope parameter η. To sum up, the positive correlation between price and sales in our model
essentially depends on the interaction between quality and variable markup mechanisms.
In Panel D of Figure 4, we depict the positive relationship between markup and productivity
within and across countries. Suppose the log case (i.e., σ = 1), the markup could be explicitly
 2η1

. As depicted in Panel D, the markup for a firm with the same producexpressed as ϕ∗ϕ(ε)
ij
tivity in high-income destination market should be higher since export productivity cutoff ϕ∗ij
is lower in high-income market.12
Discussion of Alternative Models As we have just shown, our simple model that blends
the “Washington Apples” mechanism with the variable markup framework of Jung, Simonovska
and Weinberger (2019) is capable of explaining all three empirical facts that appeared in
Section 2. We now discuss the ability of more parsimonious models to confront these facts.
One branch of the literature extends the standard firm-heterogeneity model of Melitz (2003)
by adding product quality differentiation (e.g., Johnson, 2012). These models can predict
positive correlation between price and sales within a market across firms, but cannot explain
the fact that firms set higher export prices in higher-income destinations and that more firms
export to higher-income destinations. Moreover, they cannot confront the variation in markups
across firms that has been documented by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012).
Another class of model features non-homothetic preferences and firm heterogeneity but
lack endogenous quality (e.g., Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger, 2019). These models are
well designed to confront the structure of observed markups across markets and perform well
quantitatively along this dimension. In the absence of an endogenous quality mechanism they
cannot qualitatively match the observed positive correlation between price and sales within a
market across firms or the fact that more productive firms charge higher prices within a given
market.
Models that feature firm heterogeneity, endogenous quality, and variable markups are rare.13
A key exception is Antoniades (2015) who embeds endogeneous quality into the model of
Melitz-Ottaviano (Melitz and Ottaviano, 2008). As in Melitz and Ottaviano’s model, more
productive firms charge higher markups but additionally can increase the quality of their output
by incurring fixed innovation costs that rise in the quality of good produced. A unique feature
12

Conditional on the same market, the distribution of markups should be the same because the term
1
 2η
would follow a Pareto distribution with shape parameter equal to 2ηθ. Hence, we compare the
different markup across countries for the same firm instead of depicting the market distribution within each
market.
13
Feenstra and Romalis (2014) feature endogenous quality and variable markups but do so in an environment
that lacks firm heterogeneity. Their analysis is not concerned with the across firm structure of prices and
revenues.



15

of Antoniades’s model is that market size induces quality upgrading and so prices charged by
firms in large markets should be higher as is true in the data. While our model does not make
this prediction regarding market size and prices, our model, unlike the Antoniades model,
is consistent with the well-documented “Washington Apples” phenomenon. As the models
differ in what facts they can explain, we choose to work with our relatively more parsimonious
and highly tractable model. The Antoniades model is substantially more difficult to take to
data because the endogenous quality choice mechanism generates firm level variables that are
complicated functions of many model parameters and of endogenous aggregate variables.

3.3

Aggregation and Equilibrium

In order to analytically solve the model and to derive stark predictions at the firm and aggregate
levels, we follow much of the literature and assume that firm productivities are drawn from
a Pareto distribution with cdf Gi (ϕ) = 1 − bi ϕ−θ and pdf gi (ϕ) = θbi ϕ−θ−1 , where shape
parameter θ > 1 and bi > 0 summarizes the level of technology in country i. We assume
ϕ∗ij > bi for all ij so that the cutoff is active for all country pairs. The idiosyncratic cost shock
ε is drawn from a log normal distribution, where log ε follows the normal distribution with zero
mean and variance σε2 .
We first derive the measure of the subset of entrants from i who surpass the productivity
threshold ϕ∗ij (ε) and so serve destination j. The exporting firm mass from i to j, Nij , is defined
as
Z ∞


Nij = Ji
Pr ϕ > ϕ∗ij (ε) f (ε) dε,
0

where Ji is the potential firm mass in country i and f (ε) is the pdf distribution of ε. The
following simple expression of this mass of entrants can be obtained
Nij = κJi bi ϕ∗ij

−θ

,

(13)

where κ is a constant, and ϕ∗ij is the deterministic component of the productivity cutoff given
by equation (12).14
Note how the measure of entrants from i into market j depends on the “choke price,” p̃∗j
through equation (12). An increase in the choke price induces a lower deterministic productivity
cutoff and this expands the measure of firms operating there. The elasticity of the measure
of active firms with respect to the choke price is θη, and this illustrates how the “Washington
Apples” effect interacts with the underlying productivity dispersion across firms.
We will see that all of the other aggregates in the economy are tightly linked to (13).
In deriving these aggregates it is useful to define the conditional density function for the

As shown in Appendix C that contains detailed derivation for aggregate variables Pj , Pjσ , Xij

we may write these price statistics as

where Nj = i Nij is the total mass of firms from all countries that have positive sales in
country j, and β and βσ are constants that obtain after integrating out ε from each expression
(see Appendix C). Similar constants will also appear in each of the aggregate relationships
displayed below.
We assume that there is free entry. Hence, in equilibrium, the expected profit of an entrant
is zero and aggregate profits obtained by individual consumer are also zero. As a result, the
representative consumer’s income yj reduces to the wage rate wj since each consumer has a

 σ1

unit of labor endowment. Then we have p̃j = x̄P 1−σ

equation (15) and (16), imply that the quality-adjusted choke price is
p̃∗j =

(17)

Importantly, an increase in the per capita income in a country, wj , is associated with a greater
choke price, while an increase in competition, Nj , is associated with a lower quality-adjusted
choke price.
Having derived expressions for the “choke price” and the price indices, it is straightforward
to show that the total expenditure of country j on the goods from country i, given by

where Xj ≡ wj Lj is total absorption. Equation (18) shows that our model shares with many

So, as in standard models of monopolistic competition in the Krugman tradition, the measure

we assume trade is balanced:

Quantification

This section describes how we solve, calibrate and simulate our benchmark model. We first
estimate the parameters of the benchmark model. There are two sets of parameters. The
first set Θ1 = {η, θ, σε , σ}, including the inverse of quality scope, the productivity shape, the
standard deviation of specific trade cost shocks, and the elasticity of substitution. The second

j=1

We show that our model specification enables us to identify Θ1 without information about Θ2 .
Therefore, we can first identify Θ1 , and then recover macro level parameters in Θ2 through the
structural equations implied by the model. We then simulate the model based on parameter
estimations.

4.1

Parameterization

In this subsection, we first show how a gravity equation can be used to recover an important
model parameter. Next, we show how the remaining parameters in the set Θ1 can be recovered.
Finally, we show that given estimates of the parameters in Θ1 , the model’s structural equations
can be used to recover the parameters in Θ2 .
Gravity and the Two Trade Elasticities
The set Θ1 = {η, θ, σε , σ} contains four key parameters of our model. We begin by discussing
the estimation of θ. Following Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Arkolakis et al. (2018), we
estimate θ from the coefficient on tariffs in a gravity equation. Taking the logarithm of equation (23) yields an empirical gravity equation for estimation:

where Si is the exporter fixed effect, and Sj is the importer fixed effect. We call the coefficient
on log τij the ad-valorem trade cost elasticity and the coefficient on log Tij the specific trade
cost elasticity. Note that these coefficients are structural but identify different parameters.
To estimate a trade elasticity, we must make auxiliary assumptions. First, we assume
that both log Tij and log τij are linear in bilateral pair geography. Second, we assume that
the majority of the tariff variation observed for manufacturing goods are ad valorem, which
is reasonable for manufactured goods.17 Following Waugh (2010) and Jung, Simonovska and
Weinberger (2019), we use a set of gravity variables to proxy for Tij and for τij through the
16

In our calibration, we focus on 36 countries, i.e., I = 36.
Strictly speaking tariffs are not standard cost shifters like shipping costs, but we follow much of the literature
in assuming that they are. For a discussion see Costinot and Rodrguez-Clare (2014) and Felbermayr, Jung and
Larch (2013).

following equations:
(η − 1) log (Tij ) = αT + exTi + γhT dh + γdT log (distij ) ,
log τij = ατ + exτi + γhτ dh + γdτ log (distij ) + log tarij ,
where αT and ατ are constants. As in Waugh (2010), we also add an exporter fixed effect, exi ,
a set of three dummy variables, dh , indicating whether (1) the trade is internal; (2) whether the
two country use the same currency; (3) whether the two country use the same official language,
and the logarithm of distance from country i to country j, log (distij ). This yields the following
estimating equation:

where εij is assumed to be Gaussian measurement error. Note how the coefficient on tariffs,
the ad valorem trade cost elasticity, has a structural interpretation. It is the productivity
distribution shape parameter θ. Further, also note that with an estimate of θ it becomes
possible to back out from these estimates the aggregate trade cost (Tij )η−1 τij .
The bilateral trade share λij is constructed following the method in Ossa (2014) by using
the GTAP 9 data for the year 2004.18 Bilateral gravity variables: distij , dh (common currency,
common official language) is taken from the CEPII dataset. The tariff data is from WITS,
where we compute the average tariff rate for all HS6 sectors of each destination to represent
tarij .19 We let tarij = 1 if trade is internal. We also let tarij = 1 if both i and j belongs to EU,
NAFTA, ASEAN members countries. For the case of EU, we apply common external tariff by
the EU for non-EU members. The summary statistics are presented in Table 4.

The coefficients on the gravity variables and tariffs obtained by estimating equation (25)
via OLS are shown in Table 5. The estimates on the standard gravity variables all of their
expected sign and fall in common ranges for gravity equations (see Head and Mayer, 2014).
For instance, a 10 percent increase in distance is associated with an approximately 7.65 percent
18
The bilateral trade shares λij are only constructed for our selected 36 countries. For any i 6= j, we first
compute Xij as the sum of trade flow from i P
to j across all GTAP sectors. We then compute
Xjj as the total
P
domestic output, Xj , minus its total export, i6=j Xji . We then compute λij = Xij / i Xij . One important
advantage of using GTAP is that we do not get missing/negative value for our constructed Xjj , and hence all
the values for λij are valid.
19
2004 tariff data for Russia is not available. We use the year 2005 instead. We also try year 2002 as an
alternative, the result is very similar.

and is measured with high precision.20 We now discuss the estimation of the model’s other key
parameters.
The Remaining Parameters of Θ1
Our approach to estimating the remaining coefficients is very different. To identify the idiosyncratic dispersion in trade costs, σε , the taste parameter σ, and the quality upgrading cost
elasticity η, we make use of our estimate of θ, the model, and moments from firm-countryproduct data on unit values (pij (ω) in the model) and export values (rij (ω) in the model). The
core of our estimation strategy involves using the first-order condition for price determination
(6) and values of σ, σε , and η to generate an artificial dataset that match the standard deviation
of the logarithm of price charged by Chinese firms, the standard deviation of the logarithm of
the corresponding sales, and the correlation of the logarithm of prices with the logarithm of
sales.
We follow the simulated method of moments procedure in Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz
(2011) and Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019). In particular, we define u ≡ bc ϕ−θ , where
bc denotes China’s productivity. The cumulative distribution of u can be shown as follows

Equation (26) implies that a firm that has received cost shock ε will export when u < u∗cj (ε).
Importantly, ũ ≡ u∗u(ε) follows a uniform distribution from (0, 1] where the highly efficient
cj
firms with ũ close to zero and the marginal firms with ũ close to 1. We first draw 1,000,000
realizations of ũ from uniform distribution on (0, 1]. Each draw corresponds to a simulated
exporters. For each exporter, we draw I (=36) destination specific realizations of ε̃s from the

standard normal distribution. Note that by construction, ũ ≡ ϕ∗ϕ(ε)
and ε̃ ≡ σ1ε log ε, thus

Note that the inverse of the left hand side follows a Pareto distribution with location parameter

To connect the implied pricing behavior in the model with the Chinese firm-product-country
data, we define the following transformation:

this implies that the standard deviation of log exporter price, once we subtract the destination
average to eliminate the constant term (the last term on the right), will only depend on the
parameter set Θ1 = {η, θ, σε , σ}, and is not destination specific.
Making similar transformations for the logarithm of the sales revenue of a firm, given by

(29)

This expression shows that the standard deviation of country-product exports by Chinese
firms, once it has been demeaned by subtracting its sector-destination mean, depends only on
parameters ηθ and σ. Notice that two types of relationships here are relevant. First, both
parameters drive the standard deviation of log rij (ũ) , while only σ governs the dependence
22

of log rij (ũ) on p̃ij (ũ) /p̃∗j . Moreover, we can obtain the correlation between log-sales and
log-price given parameters ηθ, σε , and σ. Our discussion suggests that these three moments
are sufficient to jointly identify our three parameters ηθ, σε , and σ via simulated Generalized
Method of Moments, while our gravity estimate of θ allows us to separate η from θ.
We now summarize the estimation strategy. First, we calibrate σ to target the standard
deviation of the log of export sales. To see this, notice that in equation (29), p̃ij (ũ) /p̃∗j
is bounded from 0 to 1 (the marginal exporter to destination j takes value 1 while for the
most productive firms it tends toward 0). An increase in σ makes sales more responsive to
productivity and so leads to larger sales dispersion. Second, we choose σε to target the standard
deviation of the log of export price. Firms’ marginal cost depends on the trade cost draw ε̃ (see
equation (28)), so greater dispersion of these shocks yields greater dispersion of price. Third,
the correlation between log-sale and log-price helps to identify ηθ. In a model without quality,
as in Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019), price and sales exhibit negative relationship
because the productive firms have lower marginal cost. This negative relationship is overturned
here because high productivity firms produce higher quality which allows firms to raise their
prices. This mechanism can also be seen from the log (ũ) term in equation (28): a lower
ũ implies a higher real efficiency and hence higer price and sales. The distribution of ũ is
governed by the value of ηθ. We now turn to our construction of the data moments.
To construct the three micro moments for the data, we use the Chinese customs’ ordinary
trade data at the year 2004. We aggregate the data into firm-country-HS6 level, construct
our data moments for by each country-HS6 pair and choose the median among them. The
parameters are jointly identified through the following minimization routine:
min

ηθ,σε ,σ

n
0 
o
mD − mM (ηθ, σε , σ) W mD − mM (ηθ, σε , σ)

where mD is the (column) vector that contains the data moments, and mM (ηθ, σε , σ) contains
the corresponding model moments. W is identity weighting matrix.
Following Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019), we check the sensitivity of our quantitative results by comparing the estimates from our exactly identified benchmark to those
obtained from an over-identified specification. In the over-identification specification, we target a larger set of the moments from the distribution of sales and prices (e.g., the 90-to-10,
90-to-50, and 99-to-90 percentile ratios of log sales and log prices). These additional moments
are desirable given that the focus of the quantitative exercise in this paper is to match both
sales and price dispersions as well as the relationship between the two.
Solving for Θ2
The set of Θ2 includes all endogenous macro variables. We begin by describing how we uncover
wages, the measure of total entrants per market, and aggregate prices statistics.
To solve wage wi for each country, we use the labor market clearing condition, which is
23

given by

Xij =

Here we normalize the wage in US to be 1 so that every other countries’ wages are all relative to
the US. Market size Li is proxied by total population of that country, which is from the CEPII
dataset. Note that market size immediately pins down the number of entrants per country,
f Ji , from equation (21).
To recover bj , we use the importer fixed effect from the gravity estimation in equation (23)
which is

Sj = log (f Jj ) bj (wj )

where Sj is the estimated importer fixed effect.21 The bilateral trade cost Tijη−1 τij can also
be recovered from the gravity equation (23).22 Finally, we solve for the mass of firms that serve
country j, Nj , using equation (13), and equation (17). These two equations when combined

Having recovered all the variables in this expression up to the constants, we can use Chinese
custom data to compute the total number of firms that export from China to country j, NChina,j ,
except for China itself. Then Nj (j 6= China) can be computed from the above equation.

4.2

Model Simulation

Given estimates for all the key parameters, we can simulate the model to assess its ability to
reproduce the facts that were illuminated in Section 2. We follow the procedures below to
construct the full panel of model generated exporters:
(1) For each draw of ũ, we construct entry hurdles u∗cj (ε̃) for each country j using equation
(26).

(2) For each ũ, we compute u∗cjmax = maxj6=China u∗cj (ε̃) . This is the minimum requirement
productivity for a firm to sell their product in countries other than China. We then construct
u = u∗cjmax ũ using our draw of ũ in step (1). Because in the model, the measure of firms that
export from China to country j is u∗cjmax , our artificial exporter u is assigned a sampling weight
of u∗cjmax .
(3) For each u, we set the export status δcj indicating whether firm u exports to j to be
given by

1, if u ≤ u∗cj (ε̃)
δcj (u) =
0, otherwise
21

In the above regression, we’ve added both the importer and exporter fixed effect. This induces multicollinearity. To avoid this, we follow Levchenko and Zhang (2016) and normalize the importer fixed effect Sj
for US to 0. Essentially, we choose US for the reference country, and the importer fixed effect estimates for all
other countries are all relative to the reference country.

Note that we set Tjj

obtain firm level productivity from ϕ = buc θ . Second, we construct exporter-destination

τij
relative magnitudes and cross-country variation in Tij and τij . Motivated by the discussion in
Hummels and Skiba (2004), we assume that Tij specific costs account for all of the geographic
variation in the gravity equation and τij is driven exclusively by tariffs. Finally, we compute
firm-level prices that are not adjusted for quality:
pij (ũ, ε̃) ≡

p̃ij (ũ, ε̃) ∗
p̃j qij (ũ, ε̃) ,
p̃∗j

where p̃ij (ũ, ε̃) are solved through the pricing equation (27). Finally, firm sales can be constructed from equation (4).
In summary, after dropping non-exporting Chinese firms, we have constructed a dataset
that contains one million exporting firms that can export to a maximum of (I − 1) countries.
We now turn to the estimation results and the assessment of model fit.

Results

In this section, we begin with the benchmark model by reporting the parameter estimates for Θ1
for both the exactly identified and the over identified cases. We then report summary statistics
for our estimates of the parameters in Θ2 calculated using the exactly identified parameters
in Θ1 and generate pseudo-Chinese exporters that is comparable with the customs data to
evaluate the model fit by comparing the real data and model simulated data. We conclude the
section by presenting the welfare results of our model.

5.1

Model Fit

We begin with our estimates of the key parameters of the benchmark model which are shown
in the following table. Table 6 lists our calibration results for the key set of parameters Θ1 ,
and shows that the parameter estimates obtained under both exact identification and over
identification strategies are similar. As in Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019), when
we try to match the tails of the sales and prices distribution in the over identification case,
σ increases to match the large dispersion in the firm-level data. Compared with the exactidentified case, the over-identified model slightly overpredicts the dispersion of firm sales and
prices.

Notes: The targeted moments are constructed from customs data, which covers the universe of all exporters and importers. The non-targeted moments are constructed from the merged sample based on
customs data and Chinese Manufacturing Survey data provided by NBSC (National Bureau of Statistics
of China), because we need both exporters and non-exporters in the non-targeted moments to check
exporter domestic sales advantage, and we also need total sales information from the NBSC data to
compute export intensity.

Table 7 further presents the data targets and the simulation results for both targeted
moments (see Panel A) and non-targeted moments (see Panel B). Given the trade elasticity,
our model matches the targeted moments relatively well although it underestimates the extreme
skewness in firm sales and overestimates the skewness in firm prices.
Our non-targeted moments are exporter sales advantage, measured as the ratio of domestic
sales of exporters to non-exporters, and exporters’ export intensity measured as the share of
output that is exported. There are three measures of export intensity: the share of firms
that export less than 10 percent of their total revenue, the share of firms that export between

10 and 50 percent of their output, and the share of firms that export more than 50 percent
of their output. All non-targetted moments were computed using a merged sample between
customs data and the NBSC manufacturing survey data. Here, we see that the overidentified
specification does a better job fitting the export intensity distribution than the exactly identified
model.
The markup distribution formula in our model is the same as in Jung, Simonovska and
Weinberger (2019). Yet, we fit to different moments and different parameter values are obtained. Thus, our model’s generated markup distributions have a relatively thin tail than those
in Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019). Our estimate of the elasticity of substitution imσ
= 1.26. Given that θ = 6, the model’s
plies that the upper bound for markups would be σ−1
generated markups distribution has a relative thin-tail. Thus, the average markup charged by
exporters in our model is lower than that of Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019). More
specifically, our model implied average markup is 1.0229, the log(markups) 99-50 percentile
ratio is 0.0853, and the log(markups) 90-50 is 0.0517. We plot the model simulated markups
and sales distribution in Figure A.1 in Appendix E.
We now check the model’s fit for the solution to our model. The four panels of Figure 5
demonstrate the fit of our model to data. The first panel shows that the logarithm of the wage
by country relative to country averages implied by the model closely follows the logarithm of

GDP per capita relative to country averages as reported in the CEPII data set, explaining
over 80% of the variation in cross country incomes. In the second panel, we plot the implied
productivity by country versus its GDP per capita. This too shows a very strong fit. In the
third panel, we plot model generated specific trade costs against the real data of distance from
China to each destination country and observe a very strong positive slope. In the last panel
is the number of Chinese firms that serve a particular country predicted by the model against
the actual number of entrants. Our model’s predictions closely mirror the variation across
countries in terms of the extensive margin.
We now turn our attention to the key object of interest in our paper, the relationship
between the price charged by a firm and its sales. Figure 6 illustrates the price and sales
relationship for both data and model. For the data, we first construct firm’s normalized sales
by subtracting each firm’s log sales by its HS6×destination average. We apply the same
treatment for the firm’s price. Then, for each HS6×destination pair, we sort firms’ normalized
sales into 10 deciles. In this step, we require that each HS6×destination have at least 10 firms
so that the 10 deciles can be properly obtained. We then compute the median of both the
normalized price and sales at each decile for each HS6×destination pairs. We finally aggregate
the median value for all HS6×destination pairs, leaving only one value for each sales decile.
For the model, we follow a similar procedure. Thus, each dot in the figure represents deviations
of log sales from their relevant industry mean relative to the deviations of log price from their

28

relevant industry mean.23
Quantitatively, the model traces the data reasonably well. In the data, when log firm sales
increase from -3 to +3, the logarithm of the firm price increases by 0.25, whereas in the model,
it increases by about 0.15. Hence, the model explains about 60% of the positive relationship
between price and sales. The increase for the model mostly comes from large firms, i.e. firms
that have higher sales than average. For the small firms, the model predicts a higher price level
than that of the data. The reason appears to stem from the endogenous cut-off price induced
by non-homothetic preferences that limit the scope for variation among small firms.
Note that the positive relationship between prices and sales in Figure 6 also highlights the
importance of the interaction of variable markups and endogenous quality. This is because, with
endogenous quality under monopolistic competition, variable markups as in Jung, Simonovska
and Weinberger (2019) are essential for our model, which aims to reconcile the price dispersion
across firms and across markets, to generate positive relationship between sales and prices.
If firms were to set constant markups over marginal costs, there would be no correlation
between firms’ sales and prices which can be seen from the marginal cost formula cij (ε̃) =
η
w T exp (σε ε̃). In other words, the variable markup mechanism is crucial for our model that
η−1 i ij
features both endogenous quality and pricing-to-market to deliver factual relationship of prices
and sales. On the other front, there are existing studies that rely on the quality mechanism
alone to generate this positive relationship, such as Johnson (2012), but these endogenousquality models are not able to explain the facts across countries that firms set higher export
prices in higher-income destinations and that more firms export to higher-income destinations.
Our model is to generate exporter pricing pattern both within market and across markets in a
unified general equilibrium framework.
Next we consider the model fit along dimensions not directly fit in our calibration procedure.
We first consider the within and across firm variation in prices as a function of the GDP per
capita of the destination country. Figure 7 shows this relationship for the model in the lefthand panels and in the data in the right hand panels. The top two panels are the variation
across country within firms (intensive margin) and the middle two panels are the relationships
averaged across all firms (intensive and extensive margin). The model predicts a slightly
stronger correlation between price and GDP per capita than the data but slightly less variation
than the average across all firms. Both deviations can be understood with respect to the pricerevenue relationship shown in Figure 6. Looking at only the intensive margin disproportionately
picks up firms in the higher end of the productivity distribution that have high prices and high
revenue, while the average price that includes the extensive margin picks up the small firms
whose behavior the model has trouble fitting.
We now look more closely at the extensive margin in Figure 7. The panel E is the model
prediction of the measure of entrants as a function of country per capita income while the
23

Figure 6 also suggests the positive correlation between prices and market share since market share is equal
to firm sales over the total sales by all Chinese exporting firms in that destination market. Thus, the relationship
between prices and market share would be the same as the relationship between prices and sales.

Notes:
In the top two panels, we normalize each exporter’s price by it’s price at USA
(log (pCHN,j (ϕ, ε) /pCHN,U S (ϕ, ε)) ). we then calculate the average destination price as the mean of this
normalized price across firms on each destination. For the bottom two panels, we calculate the average destination price as the simple average of log price for all exporters on that destination. For the model, wj is model
predicted wage rate; for the data, wj is the 2004 destination GDP per capita in CEPII. For consistency with
our empirical exercise, we control for log destination population, and log distance for both the data and the
model. Since the model does not have an exact counterpart for distance, we thus use Tij as a proxy.

panel F is the actual data. The model correctly predicts a positive relationship between the
two, but there is slightly less variation in the model predictions than there is in the data. In
addition, we also check the relationship between firm sales, prices and quality with market
size (measured by the product of population and wage) and plot those positive relationships
simulated by the model in Figure A.2 in Appendix E.

Welfare Discussion

In this section we show how the gains from trade are related to the key parameters of the
model. Following the Equivalent Variation approach (i.e., the welfare formula is derived by total
differentiating the expenditure function), we derive a (local) welfare formula of our benchmark
model inspired by Arkolakis et al. (2019). The change in welfare associated with a small trade
shock in country j can be derived as follows (see online appendix D for the derivation):

Equation (30) show that the key parameters for assessing welfare implications of shocks are
the parameter ρ which captures the markup elasticity, θ which governs the degree of dispersion
in productivity, and η which governs the cost of quality upgrading in the model. Here equation
(30) computes a local measure of welfare gains under a small change in trade shocks as in
Arkolakis et al. (2019).24 As in Arkolakis et al. (2019), the welfare gains should be lower than
that under the case with the constant markup.25
Note that in equation (30) the markup pass-through parameter ρ is a function of ηθ. This is
because, in equation (31), the quality adjusted marginal cost, 1/v, follows a Pareto distribution
with shape parameter ηθ. Given taste parameter σ, this implies the markup pass-through
parameter ρ depend only on ηθ. As ηθ sufficient to compute gains from trade, the role of quality

to Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019). In that

31

in accessing welfare gains relies on how we estimate ηθ (the true trade elasticity of our model),
and is therefore quantitative. Here, the distinction between the specific trade cost elasticity
and the ad-valorem trade cost elasticity is important.26 For instance, if we were to set τij = Tij ,
we would obtain the true trade elasticity with respect to trade costs is ηθ in the models with
endogenous quality. Based on equation (31), given the calibrated parameter values in Table 6
(the exact-identification results), we compute the markup pass-through elasticity ρ = 0.37 in
our benchmark model which is consistent with Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019), who
analytically show ρ ∈ (0, 0.5) for GCES models. Then we can compute welfare gains for all
countries. We now turn to a comparative static that also highlights the complications that arise
in models with ad-valorem trade costs, specific trade costs, and endogenous quality upgrading.

Comparative Static

In this section we show that the impact of trade cost shocks on prices depends crucially on
the nature of the shock. Consider a 5% increase in trade costs between country i and j as
measured by Tijη−1 τij . Whether this increase was due to an increase in Tijη−1 or τij or some
mixture of the two has no bearing on welfare or trade volume effects of the liberalization. As
shown in this section, there are very big differences in the effect of these trade liberalizations on
prices. Intuitively, an increase in Tijη−1 raises the cost of serving the market and induces quality
upgrading which leads to higher prices, whereas an increase in τij induces firms to reduce their
quality. Combined with the extensive margin effect through a change in firm productivity
cutoff after increases in trade costs, the overall effects on average export prices are different for
two types of trade costs.
In this section we demonstrate how these shocks lead to changes in prices quantitatively
and then contrast the price effects of a 5% increase in ad valorem trade cost with an equivalent
increase in specific trade cost. In addition, we check the effect of two types of trade costs shock
on the distributional moments of prices, sales, and markups.

Note that the above results are obtained by assuming tariff to act as cost shifters and using tariff to measure
trade elasticity. However, as discussed briefly in Costinot and Rodrguez-Clare (2014) and Felbermayr, Jung
and Larch (2013), tariffs could also be viewed as revenue shifters which would lead to a different estimation of
trade elasticity instead of viewing tariffs as iceberg trade costs.

in a similar way by applying the hat algebra.
Next, we re-simulate the model to generate pseudo exporters using our solved macro variables after the trade shock. We use the same firm productivity draw (ϕ) and cost shock draw
(ε) in the benchmark simulation. This guarantees that our comparative statics are performed
on the same set of firms and cost draws, and all the changes are solely driven by the change
in Tij or the change in τij . Specifically, for a firm with productivity ϕ and cost draw ε, we

The differences in the results are both striking and intuitive. On average a 5% increase in
specific trade costs induces an approximately 6.5% increase in export prices as the shock both
raises the cost of serving the market and induces firms to upgrade their quality. The increase
in firm productivity cutoff magnifies this latter effect so that there appears to be more than
100% pass through. For the case of a shock to ad valorem trade costs, the effect on average
is very close to zero because there are competing effects of roughly equal magnitude. On the
one hand, higher ad valorem trade costs induce firms to downgrade their quality and so reduce
their prices. On the other hand, higher ad valorem trade costs raise the firm productivity cutoff
which induces weaker firms to exit and thus increase average prices. These two effect offset
each other so the overall effects of ad valorem trade costs on export prices are small.
If firms set constant markups over marginal costs, the ad valorem trade costs would not
affect the price, and hence the effect on export prices is only from the changes in specific
trade costs. After introducing variable markups, the ad valorem trade costs would affect both
productivity cutoff and prices. However, its impact of ad valorem trade costs on prices is still
smaller compared to the impact of specific trade costs on prices.
The key point to take away from this comparative static is that when trade costs are a
mixture of ad valorem and specific as must be so in the real world, the relationship between
import prices, export volumes, and the gains from trade becomes complicated. The nature of
the shock determines this relationship.
Finally, we examine the effect of different trade costs on distributions of prices, sales, and
markups in different destinations in Table 8. We focus on the same set of firms that export to
the specific destination before and after the trade cost shock and find the following observations.
First, due to the quality mechanism, price levels change differently depending on trade shocks
from T or τ , which can be seen from the mean of log prices in panels A and B. Second, only
Due to an increase in ϕ∗CHN,j , some unproductive firms that use to export to destination j before the shock
will not be able to export after the shock.

Panel A: T shock
mean(log(prices))
Panel B: τ shock
mean(log(prices))
panel C: common responses to T and τ shocks

the price levels show differential responses to T and τ shocks. The other variables – including
the dispersion moments of prices, markups, and sales, the levels of markups and sales, as well
as the correlations between prices, markups, and sales – display identical changes in response
to either T shock or τ shock. This is because the two types of trade cost shocks have identical
effect on productivity cut-off ϕ∗cj (ε) by construction. We report those common responses of
various distributional moments to T and τ shocks in Panel C.
It is interesting to note that after the trade cost shock, the dispersion of prices alters
very little, while the dispersion of sales changes substantially.30 This is because high- versus low-productivity firms show differential responses to trade cost shocks. To demonstrate
the mechanism at work, we illustrate the changes in prices and sales by a low- versus highproductivity firm that exports to destination j using Figure A.3 (see Appendix E for details).
The analytical result of the illustration in Figure A.3 suggests that firms with different initial
productivities change their export prices to a similar extent, whereas the associated changes in
their sales are profoundly asymmetric across firms, with relatively less productive firms reducing their sales by more. As a result, we observe little changes in the dispersion of log(prices)
but larger changes in the dispersion of log(sales) after the trade cost shock.
30

See, for example, for Canada, under a cost shock of a 5% increase in T η−1 , the changes in the distributional variables are the following: std(log(prices))=0.01, 99-to-50 percentile ratio of log(prices)=-0.02 whereas
std(log(sales))=67.83, 99-to-50 percentile ratio of log(sales)=40.45.

Conclusion

In this paper, we analyzed a model that contains three mechanisms that contribute to price
dispersion across firms and countries. These mechanisms include firm heterogeneity in productivity, non-homothetic preferences that give rise to variable markups, and a “Washington
Apples” mechanism that features specific trade costs and quality choice by producers. These
three mechanisms allow our model to fit well the rich pattern of cross-country and cross-firm
price variation observed in the data.
A nice feature of our model is that incorporates specific trade costs into a quantitative
framework in a simple manner. An important implication of adding specific trade costs is that
there are now two distinct trade elasticities that arise. Cost shifters that act as ad-valorem
trade costs imply a lower elasticity than cost shifters that act as specific-trade costs. In the
absence of a way of categorizing trade costs, standard gravity equation analysis is problematic.
To overcome this, we showed that the aggregate trade elasticity could still be recovered from
variation in markups as in Jung, Simonovska and Weinberger (2019).
We also showed that the relationship between export prices and the gains from trade depends substantially on the nature of trade costs. Specifically, among trade cost shocks with
equivalent welfare implications, shocks to specific trade costs generated outsized shifts in export
prices while shocks to ad valorem trade costs had little impact on these prices.
Going forward, we hope that research in the field of international trade will become more
cognizant of the importance of modeling trade costs more flexibly. We hope that our framework
will encourage more research by demonstrating the potential quantitative importance of specific
trade costs and by showing that it is possible to write down relatively simple models that allow
for both firm heterogeneity and non-iceberg-type variable trade costs.

implies that the optimal level of quality for a firm with productivity ϕ is:

To derive the aggregate variables, we define tij = p̃ij (ω) /p∗j . Following the insight of Arkolakis

Here, we consider a generalized CES function with x > 0. If we assume that the utility function is CES function (i.e., x = 0), the markup is constant and ρ = 0. Now, the welfare gains

Explanatory notes for Figure A.3:
The upper panel plots a low-productivity firm whose productivity is only 5% above the
cutoff productivity before the trade shock, i.e., ϕ∗ϕ(ε) = 1.05. When trade cost increases by
cj
5% (either from τ or T ), ϕ∗ϕ(ε) goes to 1. Then, this producer starts to become a marginal
cj
exporter. The left y-axis plots the change of log(price), and the right y-axis plots the change
of log(sales). Clearly, the variation in price changes is very small whereas the change in sales
is large. Next, we turn to a initially high-productivity firm with ϕ∗ϕ(ε) = 2.10 shown in the
cj
lower panel. When it is hit by 5% increase in trade cost, the changes in log(price) is similar
comparing with the low-productivity exporter in the upper panel, but the change in log(sales)
is much smaller for this high-productivity firm.
