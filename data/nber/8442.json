    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper discusses the political, regulatory and economic factors that led to California's electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001.  It begins with a discussion of the origins of California's electricity restructuring and competition programs.  It then discusses the structure of the wholesale and retail markets and associated transition institutions created in 1996-98 and the performance of these institutions during their first two years of operation.  The discussion of the electricity crisis is then conveniently broken down into three phases: (a) May 2000 through September 2000, (b) October 2000 through December 2000, January 2001 to the June 2001.  Each phase is discussed in turn.  The paper concludes with a discussion of lessons about electricity market liberalization gained from the recent experience in California.\n\n",
