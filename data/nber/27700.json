    "abstract": "\n\nIntermediaries in decentralized markets can affect buyer welfare both directly, by reducing expenses for buyers with high search cost and indirectly, through a search-externality that affects the prices paid by buyers that do not use intermediaries. I investigate the magnitude of these effects in New York City\u2019s trade-waste market, where buyers can either search by themselves or through a waste broker. Combining elements from the empirical search and procurement-auction literatures, I construct and estimate a model for a decentralized market. Results from the model show that intermediaries improve welfare and benefit buyers in both the broker and the search markets.\n\n",
