    "abstract": "\n\nDespite the growing reliance on payroll taxation worldwide, there is limited evidence on the incidence of payroll taxes.  I provide new evidence by examining the experience of Chile before and after the privatization of its Social Security system.  This policy change led to a sharp exogenous reduction in the payroll tax burden on Chilean firms; the average payroll tax rate in my sample fell from 30% to 5% over this six year period.  I use data from a census of manufacturing firms, which contains information on firm specific tax payments and average wages.  I find strong evidence that the incidence of payroll taxation was fully on wages, with no effect on employment.  A potential weakness with this approach is that some of the variation in firm-specific tax rates may be spurious, for example due to measurement error in wages.  I attempt to surmount this problem by using a variety of different estimators, all of which yield consistent evidence of full shifting.\n\n",
