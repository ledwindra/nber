ABSTRACT
We examine the height of non-Hispanic US-born children born 1942-2002 on the basis of all NHES
and NHANES data sets available. We use the CDC 2000 reference values to convert height into Height-for-Age
z-scores stratified by gender. We decompose deviations from the reference values into an age-effect
and a secular trend effect and find that after an initial increase in the 1940s, heights experienced a
downward cycle to reach their early 1950s peak again only c. two decades later. After the early 1970s
heights increased almost continuously until the present. Girls born in 2002 are estimated to be 0.35[sigma]
and boys are 0.39[sigma] above their 1971 values implying an increase of circa 2.5 cm between birth
cohorts 1971 and 2002 as an average of all ages (Table 3). Age effects are also substantial - pointing
to faster tempo of growth. Girls are c. 0.23[sigma] taller at age 11 and boys 0.15[sigma] taller at age
13 than reference values (Figure 3). This translates into an age effect of circa 1.7 cm and 1.3 cm respectively.
Hence, the combined estimated trend and age-effects are substantially larger than those reported hitherto.
The two-decade stagnation in heights and the upward trend beginning in the early 1970s confirm the
upswing in adult heights born c. 1975-1983, and implies that adults are likely to continue to increase
in height. We find the expected positive correlation between height and family income, but income
does not affect the secular trend or the age effects markedly.

Introduction
While the trend in the weight of US children has been extensively reported, that of their
height has been less scrutinized even though it is a useful overall measure of biological well
being (Waaler; 1984; Bogin 1991). Currently there are conflicting reports on the secular trend
in the height of US children. For example, the new CDC reference charts for children released
in 2000 were calculated on the premise that there was no trend in the height of children
(Kuczmarski et al., 2002; Ogden et al., 2002; Roche, 1995, p. 4). However, this assessment was
made mostly on the basis of data from the 1960s through the 1980s, and a subsequent NCHS
report suggested that “mean heights… increased between the 1960s and 2002 with the mean
height of boys 6-11 years of age increasing 0.8 inches and the mean height of girls 6-11 years
of age increasing 0.6 inches. Among 12-17-year-old teens, the mean height of boys increased
0.7 inches while that of girls increased 0.3 inches although these findings were not statistically
significant” (Ogden et al, 2004, p. 2). The above dates refer to measurement years which make
it difficult to ascertain accurately when the increase actually began or more precisely what the
shape of the trend was in the second half of the 20th century. Moreover, it is unclear how much
of the above reported increase is due to a faster tempo of growth. Though limited in geographic
coverage, a study of children in a ward of the town of Bogalusa, Louisiana, documented an
increase in height of 0.7 cm per decade for children and also found that the “trends were most
pronounced among preadolescents” (Freedman et al., 2000). Thus, there is some evidence that
the height of US children have increased during the course of the second half of the 20th
century, but the actual trend and the size of the increase has not been well researched and
documented.
In contrast, evidence on adult heights indicates that heights stagnated for almost two
decades beginning with circa the birth cohorts of 1955 among women and 1960 among men,
but a positive trend might have started again among those born between 1975 and 1983
(Komlos and Baur 2004, Komlos and Lauderdale 2007), but the letter inference is based on

relatively few observations. The evidence on children’s and adolescent’s heights enables us to
test if the patterns obtained for adults can be replicated and also makes it possible to continue
the trend past 1983 until 2002. Using children’s and adolescent’s trends we can predict if adult
heights will continue to increase.
Data
We estimate for the first time the long-term trends in the height of US-born children
stratified by gender and ethnicity on the basis of surveys collected between 1959 and 2004 by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The following surveys are used: National
Health Examination Surveys: (NHES I: 1959-62, NHES II: 1963-65, NHES III: 1966-70) and
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES I: 1970-74, NHANES II:
1976-80, NHANES III: 1988-94, and NHANES 1999-2004). Heights in the surveys are actual
measurements, not self-reported values.The data pertain to birth cohorts from 1942 to 2002.
We confine our analysis to non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites born in the United
States in order to obtain a degree of homogeneity in the sample. (Hitherto we drop the
designation non-Hispanic for the sake of brevity.) Throughout the study we use the
standardized height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) released by the Center for Health Statistics in
2000 as reference values (Kuczmarski et al., 2002). These references are based on data
collected 1963-1994, i.e., the birth cohorts of c. 1942-1992.
We calculate HAZ values for each child aged 2-19 years in the surveys using the CDC
2000 reference values, stratified by gender: N = 19,143 girls and N = 19,805 boys. The HAZ
values are calculated by using the nutritional component of the program “EPI Info” published
by the Center for Disease Control. (If the age in months at the exam was not given, it was
calculated as the difference between date of birth and date of exam.) Thereafter, we use these
HAZ scores (weighted) for further analysis by gender and birth cohort. (We standardize the
weights in the various surveys by dividing the weights by the average weight in that sample. We then
use these weights in the further analysis.) The shortcoming of this approach is that it treats a one

standard deviation (σ) change at all ages identically, whereas in actuality children’s growth is
not uniformly responsive to environmental effects at all ages. Nonetheless, the average HAZ
values enable us to summarize trends and age effects in a convenient and easily recognizable
fashion. We analyze blacks and whites together insofar as the former make up circa 15% of
the total sample and therefore do not affect the main results substantially, even though their
growth differs in important respects from that of whites.
Descriptive Statistics
The CDC 2000 reference values are quite close to actual mean values for the first three
surveys (1959-1980) (Table 1). The slightly positive values of c. 0.07σ are due to the fact that
our sample is restricted to US-born non-Hispanic children, while the reference values pertain
to all children living in the US. However, the children in the most recent surveys (1988-1994
and 1999-2004) are uniformly shifted upward, i.e., are taller than the reference values by
0.21σ to 0.30σ for boys and by 0.21σ to 0.23σ for girls (Figures 1 and 2, and Table 1).
Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 about here
However, at some ages the discrepancy is greater. Particularly at ages 4 and 5 and
again at 10 and 11 the girls are 0.5σ-0.6σ taller in the most recent survey. Given that the σ’s
are 5-8 cm, the differences can be substantial: they are about 2.3 cm for ages 4 to 5 years and
c. 4.5 cm for ages 10 and 11. This indicates that the girls experience a larger adolescent
growth spurt than in the previous surveys and that their final height is also somewhat above
the reference value by 0.21σ or c. 1.4 cm (Figure 1). The height of boys is more consistently
above the reference values. The greatest increases of about 0.5σ are at age 5, 11, and 15
(Figure 2). This implies an upward shift at these ages similar to that of girls, and the final
height of boys is also around 0.16σ above the reference values (if one averages the values
obtained at ages 18 and 19).

Method of Decomposing age and time effects
The upward shift of the HAZ values described above is composed of an age and a time
effect. To study these more systematically we use a non-linear regression model that enables
us to estimate these effects by smoothing adjacent values of a coefficient using polynomial
splines for non-linear effects. We use BayesX, a “freeware” computer program (Brezger,
Kneib, Lang, 2005; Brezger, Lang, 2006; Lang, Sunder 2003). BayesX estimates fixed effects
as well as the functional relationships between the dependent and independent variables of
interest. The advantage of these models is that a parametric structure is not superimposed
upon the data, i.e., it is not specified a-priori. Thus, we do not assume, for example, that the
height increased linearly or as a polynomial. Rather, the functional relationship (in addition to
the fixed effects) is flexibly determined by the data rather than being determined in advance.
In the basic model we allow only for ethnic fixed effects, as well as for flexible functions of
age (f1) and of the year of birth (f2) to influence the HAZ-scores. We estimate the following
additive model separately for males and females:
(Eq. 1)

HAZ = γ 0 + γ 1 ⋅ Black + f 1 ( AGE ) + f 2 ( BYEAR) + ε

where γ0 and γ1 are constants, Black is a dummy variable for African-Americans, AGE is the
age of the person at the examination in months, BYEAR is the year of birth and f1 and f2 are
functions to be estimated.
As an extension of the above model we consider that part of the secular trend in height
could be due to an increase in income insofar as household income is generally associated
positively with taller children. We can control for income by estimating the following model
again separately for males and females:

(Eq. 2)

HAZ = γ 0 + γ 1 ⋅ Black + f1 ( AGE ) + f 2 ( BYEAR) + f 3 ( PIR) + ε

where the symbols are the same as in Eq. 1, and f3 is a function to be estimated and PIR is the
household’s poverty income ratio, a measure of income adjusted for inflation and for
household size (http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/thresh05.html). (In order
to explore the validity of these models we also estimated ordinary least square regression
models with 2nd degree polynomials in both age and PIR. We find that heteroscedasticityrobust standard errors only deviate marginally from the original ones, so that
heteroscedasticity is not likely to be a serious problem for our estimation. We clearly prefer
the spline approach, however, because the age-specific differences from the reference
standard (Figures 1 and 2) exhibit much more non-linearity than a parsimonious polynomial
specification could capture.)

Results of the Multivariate Analysis
The estimated constant in Eq. 1, γ0, is 0.057 for girls and 0.075 for boys. They imply
that on average children are taller than the reference values (all ages for the whole period) by
these amounts (Table 2). This is due in part to the fact that we are considering only US-born
children, but also because the reference values are for a shorter period than the sample we are
using. The coefficient of ethnicity implies that on average black girls are 0.169σ taller than
white girls and that black boys are 0.062σ taller than white boys (Table 2).

Table 2 about here
We report the estimated values of the function f1 in Eq. 1 by way of a graph (Figure 3).
We added γ0 to the estimated values of f1 as γ0 pertains to all ages. We do the same with γ1
except we weight it with the share of blacks in the sample (0.152). The age effects are smaller
than those implied by the descriptive statistics as one would expect because the descriptive
statistics also include the secular trend. However, both genders are markedly taller than the
reference values at age 5 among girls and at age 6 among boys. The age effect is particularly

large among girls ages 10-12 years: they are nearly 0.23σ above the reference values. Among
boys the effect occurs somewhat later and is less pronounced but lasts longer throughout
adolescence. Their maximum of 0.15σ is reached at ages 13 and 14 years. The 95%
confidence intervals are also sketched for boys in order to show that the age effect is
significantly different from zero at most ages. The confidence intervals are not shown for girls
nor in the other graphs for sake of clarity, but they are all about the same magnitude as those
for the boys shown in this diagram. The age effects are in addition to the secular trends
depicted in Figure 4 which affect all ages.

Figures 3 and 4 and Table 3 about here
The secular trend is estimated by f2 in Eq. 1 (Figure 4). These reflect the trend in
height of the children in our sample averaged for ages 2-19. (The graph has been adjusted for
the estimated coefficients of the black dummy variable weighted by their share in the
population.) The estimates indicate that heights increased until c. 1950 among girls and 1951
among the boys (Table 3). Thereafter, there was a declining tendency and more so among
boys than girls. The trends again reached their previous peak among boys around 1969 and
among girls in c. 1971. Thereafter height of girls increased until 2002, while boys increased
somewhat faster after the late 1970s but ceased to grow toward the very end of the period
under consideration. There was a short period in the early 1980s when the rate of change
slowed for both genders. In 2002 girls end up being 0.26σ above and boys 0.29σ above the
CDC 2000 reference values.
The predicted HAZ level for a certain age and birth year can be obtained by adding the
respective values from Figures 3 and 4. The combined HAZ levels are to be multiplied by the
standard deviations for that age in order to convert the HAZ values into centimetres. For
example, for a two-year-old girl born in 2002 the combined HAZ value becomes 0.19 (=0.260.07) and given the σ of 5.1 cm, the estimated level becomes c. 1.0 cm above the reference
value.

The estimated constants for Eq. 2, γ0 and γ1, are reported in Table 4. The inclusion of
PIR does not change appreciably the shape of the estimated secular trend effects (Figure 5).
Holding income constant the trend among girls would have been somewhat lower by 2002
(0.04σ), and it would have taken both boys and girls a few years longer to regain the height
losses that they experienced in the 1950s and early 1960s (Table 3). The age effects change
very little and are therefore not reported here.

Figure 5 and Table 4 about here
The income effect is estimated by the function f3 (Figure 6). As one would expect height
increases with income in most range of income and the effect is substantial; the difference is
about 0.4-0.5σ between the poor and the rich. In other words, the income effect is about the
order of magnitude of the combined age and trend effects that have been experienced between
1942 and 2002. However, the pattern has two unusual aspects to it: a) the decline in height
among the boys between 0 and 0.4 PIR, which may well be due to misclassification, to small
number of observations, or perhaps because these are children of students who do not yet earn
much income; and b) the heights of both boys and girls decline with very high incomes:
maximum is reached among girls at c. 3.7 PIR and among boys at c. 4.4 PIR. This suggests
that there are diminishing returns to income but the slight decline is mysterious and needs
further investigation.

Conclusion
We document the secular trend and age-dependent shifts in the height of US-born
black and white children born 1942-2002 by comparing their HAZ scores on the basis of the
CDC 2000 reference values. We find that heights increased in the 1940s, only to decline in
the 1950s but did recover by c. 1971 (Figure 4). The cause of this fluctuation is mysterious,
but insofar as it coincides with the baby-boom generation it might well be related to that
development. The period of stagnation become longer when we control for household income,

implying that the rise in income did contribute to overcoming the declining tendency (Figure
5). After c. 1971 a positive secular trend in height was continuous until 1999 among boys and
until 2002 among girls.
The CDC reported a change of 2.0 cm and 1.5 cm in the mean height of boys and girls
aged 6-11 years between the 1960s and 2002. Among 12-17-year-old teens, the mean height
of boys has reportedly increased by 1.8 cm and of girls by 0.8 cm respectively (Ogden et al,
2004, p. 2). In contrast, our results for the secular trend for black and white non-Hispanic USborn children are: 0.35σ for girls and 0.39σ for boys as an average of all ages (Table 3). This
implies an increase on the order of c. 2.5 cm between 1971 and 2002, which is markedly
larger than the one reported by the CDC team possibly because we exclude Hispanics and
foreign born (Ogden et al, 2004, p. 2).
In addition, we find that pre-adolescent girls tend to be taller than reference values by
about 0.23σ at age 11 and adolescent boys by about 0.15σ at ages 13 and 14 (Figure 3). This
translates into an age effect of c. 1.7 cm and 1.3 cm respectively. Hence, our combined
estimated trend and age-effects are larger than those reported by the CDC, but are more
conforming to the results reported in the Bogalusa study which posited a 0.7 cm increase per
decade (Freedman et al., 2000).
The results of this study tend to confirm the patterns found on the basis of adult
heights (Komlos and Lauderdale 2007). There was a two-decade period of stagnation from the
early 1950s to the early 1970s among the height of children similarly to those of adults, and
heights tended to increase thereafter among both children and adults, although adult height
seems to lag children’s height by about a quinquennium. (The stagnation of adult height
began a few years after that of children’s height and the stagnation ended among adults a few
years after it ended among children.) On the basis of the trend in the children’s height it
appears that adult height will continue to increase in the near future.
