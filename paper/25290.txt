High-Capacity Donors’ Preferences for Charitable Giving

NBER Working Paper No. 25290
November 2018
JEL No. D64,H41
ABSTRACT
How can charities solicit high-capacity donors to provide the funds for matching grants and
leadership gifts? In conjunction with one of Texas A&M University’s fundraising organizations,
we conducted a field experiment to study whether high-income donors respond to non-personal
solicitations, as well as the effect of allowing for directed giving on high-income donors and their
willingness to direct their donations towards overhead costs. We found that high-income donors
are not responsive to letters or e-mails. The option to direct giving had no effect on the
probability of donating or the amount donated. Our results suggest that motivating high-income
donors requires more personal communication.
