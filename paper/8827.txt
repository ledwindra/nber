ABSTRACT
In the presence of lumpy investment cost of adjustment, globalization may have nonconventional effects on the level of investment and its cyclical behavior. Trade openness may lead to a
discrete “jump” in the level of investment, as it may trigger a discrete change in the terms of trade. Such
a shift creates a sizeable boost in aggregate investment. But trade openness may also lead to boom-bust
cycles of investment (namely, multiple equilibrium) supported by self-validating expectations. In this
sense globalization destabilizes the economy. There can be substantial gains from globalization in the
investment-boom equilibrium. However, gains could be small, or negative, in the investment-bust
equilibrium.

Introduction

The idea that “globalization may lead to instability” attracted the attention of the profession in recent years. A number of papers have shown that increased capital mobility can
be destabilizing in the sense that it increases the possibility of multiple self-fulfilling expectations equilibria; see, for example, Lahiri (1999), Meng and Velasco (1999), and Weder
(2000).

In this body of the growth literature, some external economies (as may be as-

sociated, for instance with human capital), may lead to multiplicity of equilibria. Capital
account liberalization which facilitates intertemporal consumption smoothing, increases the
range of parameter values for which multiple equilibria occur.
In the present paper we focus on the destabilizing eﬀect of trade openness, which
usually precedes capital account liberalization in the globalization process during economic
development. We employ a “lumpy” adjustment cost for new investment, in the form of
a fixed setup cost of investment. This specification, which has been recently supported
empirically by Caballero and Engel (1999, 2000), creates economies of scale in investment.
As a result, it tends to lump investment over time, in contrast to the more standard convex
cost-of-adjustment specification, that leads to the spreading of investment spending over

time. Trade-openness may aﬀect the result in the appreciation or depreciation of the setup
cost of investment, through the terms-of-trade, and thereby generates instability in the form
of boom-bust investment cycles. It is demonstrated that this multiplicity of self-validating
expectations equilibria (as it is triggered by terms-of-trade eﬀects) is an intrinsic feature of
trade-openness.
Economies of scale either in the production or investment technologies are a key
contributor to the gains from trade and economic integration. For example, based on estimates taken from a partial equilibrium analysis, the Cecchini (1988) Report assesses that
the gains from taking advantage of economies of scale will constitute about 30 percent of
the total gains from the European market integration in 1992. Similarly, in a static generalequilibrium setting, Smith and Venables (1988) provide some industry simulations of the
eﬀects of the European integration, and find again a substantial role for economies of scale.
This paper, in essence, sheds a diﬀerent light on the gains-from-trade implications of
economies of scale. There could be indeed substantial gains from trade in an investmentboom equilibrium, but the gains could be meager or even negative in an investment-bust
equilibrium.
The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 develops a model of a setup
investment cost. Section 3 describes the consumption side of the model economy. The freetrade equilibrium is analyzed in section 4. The destabilization eﬀect of trade-openness is
demonstrated in section 5, for an exogenously given export demand function, and in section
6 for a two-country model with endogenous export and import demand functions. Section 7
concludes.

Lumpy Adjustment Costs of Investment

Consider a two-good economy, and assume for simplicity that under free international trade
the economy completely specializes in the production of one good, according to the standard
comparative advantage paradigm. To get first the intuition about the basic mechanism
underlying the equilibrium level of investment, we initially assume that the demand for the
country’s export is exogenously given. In a subsequent section we will analyze a two-country
2

extension in which export demands are endogenously determined.
Specifically, one good (x) is produced domestically and can be exported abroad, but
not produced elsewhere, whereas the other good (y) is not produced domestically, and can
be only imported from abroad. The price of the domestic (and export) good is chosen as a
numeraire: px = 1. The price of the foreign (and import) good is denoted by p.
Initially, there exists a continuum of N firms in the x−industry which diﬀer from
each other by a productivity index ε. We denote a firm which has a productivity index of
ε by an ε−firm. The cumulative distribution function of ε is denoted by G(·). With no
loss of generality, we assume that the average value of the productivity index is zero, that
is E(ε) = 0. For the sake of simplicity, we further normalize the initial number of firms to
one; N = 1. The number of each type of firms grows at the rate of population growth, n, in
order to fit the overlapping-generations framework in the next section.
The production process of good x lasts one period, so that if an ε−firm employs a
stock of capital K, it will generate a certain gross output flow (of the domestic good x) of
F (K)(1 + ε), where F exhibits diminishing marginal productivity of capital, that is, F 0 > 0,
F 00 < 0. Naturally, output cannot be negative, so that ε = −1, that is G(−1) = 0. It is
also assumed that output is bounded from above, so that there exists ε̄ such that G(ε̄) = 1;
for simplicity, assume that ε̄ = 1. We further assume for the sake of simplicity that capital
fully depreciates at the end of the production process. Thus, at the start of each period the
initial stock of capital is zero.
The domestic good x serves for both consumption, domestic investment, and exports.
However, there is a fixed setup cost of investment which has to be imported;5 in the subsequent two-country extension, we let this setup cost consist of the domestic good as well.
The fixed cost is C units of the foreign good (y).
If an ε−firm invests an amount K in some period, it will have a capital stock of K
and will generate in the next period a gross output of F (K)(1 + ε) of good x. The objective
of an ε−firm is to maximize its value. That is, it chooses K so as to:

(1)

where r is the domestic rate of interest.
The first-order condition for the maximization of (1) yields the optimal K for an
ε−firm as a function of r, denoted by K̂(ε, r). This K̂(ε, r) is thus given implicitly by:

F 0 [K̂(ε, r)](1 + ε) = 1 + r,

(2)

where F 0 (·) denotes the derivative of F (·).
Note, however, that the firm always has the option not to invest at all and avoid the
setup cost (C) of a new investment. Therefore, whether an ε−firm will indeed carry the new
investment prescribed by equation (2) depends on whether its productivity is high enough
so as to more than oﬀset the fixed setup cost required for new investments. That is, the
ε−firm will indeed carry on the investment prescribed by the first-order condition (2), if and
only if:

− K̂(ε, r) + pC = 0.

Therefore, there exists a cutoﬀ level of ε, denoted by ε0 , so that an ε−firm will invest,
if and only if ε = ε0 . The cutoﬀ level of ε is defined by:

F K̂(ε0 , r) (1 + ε0 ) = (1 + r) K̂(ε0 , r) + pC .
The left-hand side of equation (3) is the output generated by the new investment.

The

right-hand-side is the (future value of the) capital cost of this investment, which consists of
a variable cost, K̂(ε, r), and a setup cost, pC.
While the marginal productivity condition (2) determines the level of investment that
each firm will undertake (if it chooses to do so), condition (3) can be viewed as determining

4

whether or not to invest at all. Firms with a productivity index larger than ε0 would indeed
attract new investment. But firms with a productivity index below ε0 will attract no new
investment.
Another way of describing how the decision whether or not to invest is determined is
obtained by substituting equation (2) into equation (3) to get:
h

h
(1 + ε0 ){F K̂(ε0 , r) − F 0 K̂(ε0 , r) K̂(ε0 , r)} = (1 + r)pC.

Equation (30 ) thus states that the infra-marginal incremental output generated by
the new investment [namely, the left-hand-side of equation (30 )] must equal (the future value
of) the setup cost; see Figure 1. Thus, an ε−firm will choose K̂(ε, r) as its optimal stock of
capital if its productivity index is above ε0 ; otherwise, it will not invest or produce at all.
Therefore, the optimal stock of capital for an ε−firm, denoted by K(ε, r), is generally given

Consumption

Consider now an overlapping-generations model with a standard representative consumer
who lives for two periods and a population growth rate of n. The individual consumes two
goods in each of the two periods, so that altogether she consumes four goods: cx1 , cy1 , cx2 ,
and cy2 , where cji is consumption of good j = x, y in the ith period of her life, i = 1, 2. She
is endowed in the first period of her life with x0 units of the domestic good. For the sake
of simplicity, we consider a time-separable Cobb-Douglas utility function with a subjective
discount factor θ :

u(cx1 , cy1 , cx2 , cy2 ) = [α ln cx1 + (1 − α) ln cy1 ]
+θ [α ln cx2 + (1 − α) ln cy2 ] ,
5

(5)

where α is the share of the domestic good in each period in the total consumption of that
same period.
As usual, this utility function gives rise to the following demand functions:

cx1 = αW/(1 + θ).

(6a)

cy1 = (1 − α)W/(1 + θ)p.

(6b)

cx2 = αθW (1 + r)/(1 + θ).

(6c)

cy2 = (1 − α)θW (1 + r)/(1 + θ)p,

(6d)

where W is the present value of life-time income (wealth) at birth. Note that, as we shall
consider a steady state, the price (p) of the foreign good remains constant over time and the
same W which is applicable to both old and young is the same.
In each period there is a new generation of firms whose ε is distributed according
to G. These firms are owned by the newly-born generation.

Therefore, the wealth of a

representative consumer is the present value of the profits of these firms. Thus, the wealth
of a representative young individual is:

Free-Trade Equilibrium

The economy is open to free trade in goods as was already mentioned, but we assume that it
does not have an access to the world capital markets. However, there are domestic financial
intermediaries that lend or take deposits at a fixed rate.6 As we assume that there is an
exogenously given downward-sloping demand curve for the country’s export, reflecting some
market power in the world markets.

Denote the foreign demand function for good x per

young individual by D(p). As p is the relative price of y, it follows that as p rises, the
demand for x rises too, so that D0 (p) > 0.
In order to complete the description of the steady-state of this economy, it remains
to state the equilibrium conditions in the markets for the two goods (x and y). Market
clearing in the domestic good (x) requires that domestic consumption of both the young
(namely, cx1 ) and the old [namely, cx2 (1 + n)−1 , per young individual], plus the domestic
R1
component of investment [namely, ε0 K(ε, r)dG(ε)], plus exports [namely, D(p)] must equal
R1
domestic output [namely, (1+n)−1 ε0 F [K(ε, r)]dG(ε), per young individual], plus the initial

endowment (namely, x0 ). That is:

1 + θ (1 + θ)(1 + n)

F [K(ε, r)]dG(ε) + x0 .
1 + n ε0

(8)

With no access to foreign capital markets, the import of the foreign good is determined
by the value of exports of the domestic good, as trade in goods must be balanced period-byperiod. The imports of the foreign good in each period are equal to domestic consumption
of the young (namely, cy1 ), and the old [namely, cy2 (1 + n)−1 , per young individual], plus the

setup cost which is exclusively imported (namely, [1 − G(ε0 )]C). Note that only firms with
productivity index ε above ε0 make new investment and incur the setup cost C; the number
of such firms per young individual is 1 − G(ε0 ). Exports of D(p) units of the domestic good
can finance imports of D(p)/p units of the foreign good. Therefore:

+ [1 − G(ε0 )]C =

This completes the description of the market equilibrium in the trade-open economy.
There are four endogenous variables - W, p, r, and ε0 - and four equations - (3), (7), (8) and
(9). Note that K(ε, r) is defined implicitly by the first-order condition, equation (2) and
equation (4).
Naturally, for an economy with financial intermediaries, we shall focus our attention
on the golden-rule (eﬃcient) steady-state equilibrium in which the rate of interest (namely,
r) will be equal to the rate of population growth (namely, n), this rate is known as the
“biological” rate of interest. To see that this is indeed an equilibrium note that by employing
equation (7) we can rewrite equation (8) as:

αW
αθW (1 + r)

Thus, the golden rule (namely, r = n) is indeed an equilibrium steady state.7
Because of the setup cost of a new investment, low-productivity firms may not find

But as Gale (1973) pointed out, there is another steady state equilibrium in which r 6= n. In this case the term
r − n cancels out on both sides of equation (10), and it follows that the value of second-period consumption
of each individual [namely, θW (1 + r)/(1 + θ)] is equal to the output that accrues to that individual in the

second period [namely, ε0 F [K(ε, r)]dG(ε)]. This situation is termed by Gale as autarky vis-a-vis the young
and the old.

On the other hand, very high-productivity

firms are likely to invest. That is: as long as G(ε0 ) < 1, there will be a positive mass of
firms (namely, the firms with ε ≥ ε0 ) that will carry out new investment. The endogenously
determined cutoﬀ ε (namely, ε0 ) depends crucially on the setup cost C. If C is high enough,
then no firm will carry out a new investment, that is the endogenously-determined ε0 is equal
to (or exceeds) 1.8

Globalization and Boom-Bust Investment Cycles: Exogenous Export Demand

Does globalization introduce instability? Put diﬀerently: Does the trade-open-economy
have more than one self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium, some with “pessimistic” expectations and “low” investment (“bust equilibria) and others with “optimistic” expectations
and “high” investments (“boom” equilibria). Furthermore, is this multiplicity of equilibria
a distinct feature of globalization?
First, note that the phenomenon of multiple equilibria does not occur under autarky.
We can envisage a closed economy (autarkic) counterpart which can produce both x and y,
according to linear technologies, yielding a Ricardian linear production possibility frontier;
see Figure 2. In autarky, the price of y (denoted by p̄) is uniquely determined by the inverse
of the slope of the production possibility frontier. Then, the marginal productivity condition
(2) and the cutoﬀ equation (3) uniquely determine the autarkic level of investment and the
cutoﬀ ε (recall that r = n). Thus, the autarkic equilibrium is unique.9
However, the domestic technology of producing y is old relative to the modern world
technology; that is p̄ is “very much” higher than p. Put diﬀerently, the domestic economy
8

More realistically there may be other sectors of the economy with diﬀerent investment technologies that carry
out new investment and generate capital accumulation and growth; our one-industry economy is obviously
a theoretical simplification.
9
Note that the uniqueness result carries over to the more general cast of a convex production possibility set
(as in the Hecksher-Ohlin framework). Suppose that p̄ is an equilibrium. Now, a lower price of y will increase
the number of investing firms (namely, will lower ε0 ) and therefore the investment demand for y; it will
also boost the consumption demand for y. At the same time, because of the convexity of the production
possibility set, the supply of y will shrink, thus creating an excess demand for y. Similarly, a higher-price of
y will generate an excess supply of y. Thus, the equilibrium must be unique.

9

has a comparative advantage in producing x (or, equivalently, a comparative disadvantage
in producing y). Hence, opening up the economy to trade in goods induces it to specialize
à-la-Ricardo in producing x and benefit from the modern world technology of producing y,
by importing y.
Second, multiple equilibria may well exist under free international trade. In order to
gain some insight into the possibility of such a multiplicity of equilibria, consider the cutoﬀ
equation (3) and the trade-balance equation (9). Suppose that the 4-tuple, ε0 = ε00 , p = p0 ,
W = W 0 and r = n, constitutes an equilibrium.. Consider now a lower foreign good price
(p). This reduces the domestic value (pC) of the setup cost (C), and, as can be seen from
equation (3), it will induce more firms to make new investments. That is, a lower p may
reduce the cutoﬀ level ε0 below ε00 , so that the proportion 1 − G(ε0 ) of investing firms rises.
For such a change to occur, the economy must also have higher export revenues [namely,
D(p)/p)] in order to finance the new imports of the foreign good (namely, [1 − G(ε0 )]C)
required for the setup cost and the increased domestic consumption demand for the foreign
good (because of its lower price).
To see that this demand indeed increases, substitute for W [from equation (7)] in the
trade-balance equation (9), to get:

Indeed, one can see from (11) that a lower p boosts domestic consumption demand for the
foreign good.10
10

Recall that r = n, so that the term multiplying [1 − G(ε0 )]C on the left-hand-side of (11) reduces to α > 0.

10

Now, if the export revenues D(p)/p indeed increase when p falls, then there may
exist another equilibrium with a lower p (below p0 ) and a lower ε0 (below ε00 ) with a higher
proportion of firms making new investments. Thus, the possibility of a multiple equilibria
seems to rest on the price elasticity of the foreign demand for the country’s exports. If this
demand is inelastic, then indeed a decline in p will generate higher export revenues.11 (Note
that the price of the domestic good is 1/p, so that a decline in p means an increase in the
price of the domestic good; and if the foreign demand for the domestic good is inelastic, then
indeed an increase in its price raises export revenues.)
We establish the possibility of multiple equilibria by numerical simulations.

We

specify a uniform distribution of ε over the interval [−1, 1], so that G(ε) = (1 + ε)/2 for
ε ∈ [−1, 1]. The production function is of the Cobb-Douglas form F (K) = K β , where
β is the capital share in GNP. The foreign demand for the domestic good is specified as
D(p) = (a + p)σ , with both a and σ being positive. The simulations are depicted in Figure
3. For a range of values of C, there are (at least) two equilibria: One with a high ε0 , a high
p and low investment (the “bust” equilibrium), and another with a low ε0 , a low p, and high
investment (the “boom” equilibrium).
Our simple model suggests that the trade-open economy is plagued by an endogenously determined “boom” and “bust” investment cycles. Optimistic expectations regarding
the terms-of-trade (namely, p) are self-validated by low setup costs (namely pC), high investment, high exports, high export revenues, and low p. On the other hand, pessimistic
expectations regarding the terms of trade are also self-validated by high setup costs, low
investment, low exports, low export revenues, and high p. It should be emphasized again
that, as we have already pointed out, this multiplicity of equilibria is an intrinsic feature of
opening up the economy, because in the closed (autarkic) economy the equilibrium is unique.
11

Note that even though the aggregate foreign demand for the country’s export may be inelastic, still each
domestic firm is atomistically small and faces a perfectly elastic demand.

Globalization and Boom-Bust Investment Cycles: Endogenous Export Demand

A key mechanism behind the instability (multiplicity) of equilibria brought about by globalization is the small (less than one) elasticity of the exogenously given demand for the
country’s export. In this case only a price eﬀect plays a role in generating the instability. Indeed, inelastic demands are not unusual in certain industries.12 In general, however, demand
facing exports of small developed countries, though fairly inelastic, its elasticity though is
still above one. Nevertheless, the instability associated with globalization is not confined
to the “partial-equilibrium” specification of an exogeously given demand for the country’s
exports. In such a partial equilibrium setting only a price eﬀect plays a role in generating instability. In this section we extend our analysis to a general-equilibrium, two-country
“home” and “foreign country” model in which both income and price eﬀects play a role in
shaping the demand for a country’s exports.
We continue to assume complete specialization under free-trade. Specifically, suppose
that p̄ and p̄∗ are the autarkic relative prices of y (namely, the inverses of the absolute values
of the slopes of the linear production possibility frontiers) in the home and foreign country,
respectively. Hence, any free-trade equilibrium relative price of y will be between p̄ and p̄∗ .
The initial endowments are (x0 , y0 ) and (x∗0 , y0∗ ) in the home and foreign country, respectively.
These are in addition to the ownership of the firms in each country by the residents of that
country.
We now specify a more general technology for the setup cost of investment as follows.
12

In general, the demand facing exports of small developed countries is fairly low (unlike the textbook paradigm
of a small country), but still above one. For example, a widely cited survey by Goldstein and Khan (1985)
put this elasticity in the range of 1.0-1.6 for Austria, Belgium and Denmark. However, this elasticity refers to
aggregate measures of exports, but for a specific export good things may be diﬀerent. An inelastic demand
for a country’s certain export good can arise when the country is a major supplier of this good in the
world market. One can think of at least three categories of such goods: energy, commodities, and high-tech
products. Indeed, Robert Pindyck (1979) estimated the demand elasticity of various energy products to be
significantly below one in the short run, but about one or even a bit higher in the long-run. (For instance,
0.15-0.30 for residential and industrial demand for oil). Similarly, Pindyck (1978) estimated the demand
elasticity for a commodity such as bauxite (used to produce aluminium) to be extremely small, about 0.050.10. However, estimates of elasticity of demand for high-tech products, such as semiconductors [Irwin and
Klenow (1994)] and computers [Gordon (2000)] are higher than one, between 1.5 and 2.0.

12

(We refer to the home country; the specification for the foreign country is similar with asterisks in the notation.) There is a minimal setup input (C0 ), where this input is produced by
inputs vx and vy of x and y, respectively, according to a constant-returns-to-scale technology:
H(vx, vy ).
Each investing firm chooses vx and vy so as to minimize the setup cost, vx + pvy
subject to H(vx , vy ) = C0 . The minimizing inputs of x and y are denoted by Vx (p, C0 ) and
Vy (p, C0 ), respectively, and the minimal setup cost is denoted by:

C(p, C0 ) = Vx (p, C0 ) + pVy (p, C0 ),

(12)

in units of good x. For the foreign country, the minimal setup cost is denoted by:
1
C ∗ (p, C0∗ ) = Vx∗ (p, C0∗ ) + Vy∗ (p, C0∗ ),
p

(12∗ )

in units of good y. (Note that it is the same p, namely the free-trade equilibrium price of y,
that appears in the minimal setup cost equation in both countries.) The cutoﬀ levels of ε
in the home and foreign country, that is ε0 and ε∗0 , respectively, are now defined implicitly
by:13

F [K̂(ε0 , r)](1 + ε0 ) = (1 + r)[K̂(ε0 , r) + C(p, C0 )]

Similarly, the home country demand functions are given by equations (6a)-(6d), whereas the
demand functions in the foreign country are given by the same equations with θ∗ , α∗ , r∗ and
W ∗ replacing θ, α, r and W, respectively. The specifications of W and W ∗ are now given by:

Strictly speaking, we are essentially assuming that there are two production technologies for producing each
good. One is a Ricardian linear technology associated with some primary input, say labor. The other
technology is associated with capital [according to F (K)(1 + ε)] and exhibits diminishing marginal products
of capital; it can be employed only if the labor input used in the first technology exceeds some threshold
level. The home country meets the threshold in good x and the foreign country meets the threshold in good
y. Also, the initial endowments in each country are inclusive of what is produced under specialization via
the first technology.

In this case too we focus on the golden-rule (eﬃcient) steady-state equilibrium in
which r = n and r∗ = n∗ .
We establish the existence of multiple equilibria via numerical simulations. The setup
technologies are taken to be of the Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution (CES) form:

H(vx , vy ) = [bvxρ + (1 − b)vyρ ]1/ρ

(17)

for the home country, and
∗

H ∗ (vx∗ , vy∗ ) = [b∗ vx∗ρ + (1 − b∗ )vy∗ρ ]1/ρ

(17∗ )

for the foreign country. Upon proper substitutions, an equilibrium with a positive number
of investing firms in both countries (that is, both ε0 and ε∗0 below one) is defined by a single
(reduced-form) excess demand equation of good x, denoted by E(p) = 0, in the terms-oftrade variable p. The derivation of this equation is delegated to the appendix. Figure 4

15

describes the graph of E(·) and we can see that there are three free-trade equilibria with
p = 0.8, 1.6 and 4.1. (In addition, there may exist still other equilibria with no firms making
new investments in either country.) We have thus established the instability introduced
by globalization under endogenously-determined demand functions for imports and exports,
derived from fairly common utility and production functions.15

Concluding Remarks

In the presence of economies-of-scale in the investment technology, globalization may have
non-conventional eﬀects on the level of investment and its cyclical behavior. Trade openness may lead to a discrete “jump” in the level of investment as it may trigger a discrete
price change and specialization. In the presence of economies-of-scale, such a shift creates
a sizable boost in aggregate investment. But trade openness may also lead to boom-bust
cycles of investment (namely, multiple equilibria) supported by self-fulfilling expectations.16
In this sense, globalization destablizes the economy. The economy may alternate between
“optimistic” expectations, “good” terms-of-trade and investment boom to “pessimistic” expectations, “bad” terms-of-trade and investment bust.17
The analysis sheds new light on the implications of economies-of-scale for the gainsfrom-trade argument. There could be substantial gains in the investment-boom equilibrium.
However, gains could be small and even negative in the investment-bust equilibrium.

15

Note also that for certain parameter values there may exist no equilibrium.
Investment cycles may be driven also by other mechanisms, such as balance-sheet eﬀects; see Krugman
(2000).
17
An interesting issue yet to be investigated, is whether it is desirable to try to use trade policy to prevent the
boom-bust cycles.

Appendix: Derivation of the Equilibrium in a TwoCountry Model

With a Cobb-Douglas production function, F (K) = K β , the capital stock function of the
investing firms in the home country, as derived from equation (2), is given by:

With the CES form [equation(17)] for the setup technologies, we can derive the minimizing input requirement functions and the minimal setup cost function as follows:

With a uniform distribution of ε [namely, G(ε) = (1 + ε)/2], the cutoﬀ level of ε, as
derived from (3), is as follows [employing equation (A1)]:

The analogous equations for the foreign country are given by equations (A1)-(A8)
with C0∗ , b∗ , ρ∗ , ε∗0 , γ ∗ , β ∗ , r∗ , x∗0 and y0∗ replacing C0 , b, ρ, ε0 , γ, β, r, x0 and y0 , respectively.
Substituting equations (A1)-(A8) and their foreign country counterparts in either
one of the two market clearing equations (15) and (16) yield a single (reduced-form) excess
demand equation for good x, E(p) = 0, in the terms-of-trade variable p.
