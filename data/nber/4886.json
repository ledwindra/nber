    "abstract": "\n\nWe argue that long-term debt has a role in controlling management's ability to finance future investments.  A company with high (widely-held) debt will find it hard to raise capital, since new security holders will have low priority relative to existing creditors.  Conversely for a company with low debt.  We show there is an optimal debt-equity ratio and mix of senior and junior debt if management undertakes unprofitable as well as profitable investments. We derive conditions under which equity and a single class of senior long-term debt work as well as more complex contracts for controlling investment behavior.\n\n",
