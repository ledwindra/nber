We examine the relationship between the yield curve and the time-varying conditional volatility of the Treasury bill market. We demonstrate that differently shaped yield curves can result given different combinations of volatility and expectations about future spot rates. Moreover, adjusting the forward rate for the volatility related liquidity premium can improve its performance as a predictor of future spot rates at least for the period from August 1964 to August 1979.\n\n",
