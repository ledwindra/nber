JEL No. P16,P48
ABSTRACT
This paper offers a review of the recent empirical literature on lobbying within Political
Economy. In surveying extant evidence, we emphasize quid-pro-quo and informational issues in
special interest politics and we highlight crucial open research questions in both. The main
unresolved methodological issues remain how to properly account for the impact of lobbying on
which equilibrium policies are chosen and advanced, and on how distorted those equilibrium
policies might be relative to the interests of the general public. Of the principal open questions
within political economy, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the welfare distortions of
lobbying remains one of the most elusive

1. INTRODUCTION
The objective of this article is to provide a useful organization of the most recent empirical
literature on lobbying in Political Economy. Starting from a definition of lobbying, we will
specifically focus on the process of political influence by corporations and other business
interests on elected officials or appointed bureaucrats through means of information or other
resources (e.g. campaign contributions or employment opportunities) in the adoption, retention,
or amendment of public policy.1
To the reader interested in the topic and approaching it for the first time the research question at
the bleeding edge of this literature will be immediately clear. Is lobbying and, more generally,
the direct or indirect interaction between business interests and the government welfare
enhancing for the general public and electorate? Or is it instead distortive and deleterious? Is
lobbying a valid political mechanism “to petition the government for a redress of grievances”, as
The National Institute for Lobbying & Ethics (a trade association representing American
lobbyists) vividly asserts, borrowing from the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution?2 Or is
it a tool for the distortion of public policy from the social optimum, a crucial cog in the
mechanism of transforming concentrated economic power into political heft and corruption?
To the average voter the answer appears surprisingly unambiguous. The role of lobbyists and
special interest groups in Washington was indicated as a “very big problem” by 53% of
respondents to three surveys conducted by the Pew Center between September 2018 and March
2019.3 (It was 38% for illegal immigration, in comparison.) Lobbyists are also consistently
ranked at the rock bottom in terms of trustworthiness, honesty and ethical standards. According
to the Gallup annual survey of Honesty and Ethics in the Professions lobbyists are ranked in any
year between 2007 and 2017 as “very low” or “low” by 60% of the sample (the low point in
terms of reputation is 2008 with 64% and the high point 2013 with 56%).4 (It was 25% for
bankers, in comparison.)

To the average researcher currently working in this area bordering Economics, Political Science,
and Sociology, the scientific answer appears instead far from clear-cut and settled. Indeed, given
the variety and depth of the studies reviewed in what follows and the often nuanced nature of
some of the results we will discuss, this article will likely add to this lack of clarity. We can
candidly anticipate that the reader interested in an answer to the question of whether lobbying is
“bad or good” will not find it here.
For the sake of cleanness of exposition we will refer, wherever not excessive in the way of
oversimplification, to the interactions of a representative firm F facing a government official P
(politician) directly, or indirectly through an external lobbyist L. This initial distinction between
direct and intermediated interaction between F and P will turn out to be relevant from the
empirical perspective. It also happened to have been an issue initially overlooked in the early
empirical literature on special interest politics, especially in the context of lobbying for trade
policy (e.g. Goldberg and Maggi, 1999; Gawande and Bandyopadhyay, 2000; Gawande et al.,
2012), but now understood to be crucial from the perspective of an empirical assessment of the
welfare consequences of lobbying (for instance in Blanes i Vidal, Draca, and Fons-Rosen, 2012;
Bertrand, Bombardini, and Trebbi, 2014).
The interaction among the main set of players {F, L, P} will typically revolve around the
demand of a certain “policy” by F and the ability of P of supplying such policy. Defining and
empirically circumscribing what that policy supply is and what the counterfactual policy that
would have been implemented by P, absent the political influence of F, is the crux of the
empirical literature that we study.
For the most part, one can state confidently that measuring what F obtains from lobbying is one
of the most complex dimension of empirical research in this area. The reason for this complexity
will be rather transparent. What a specific firm F demands may be extremely specific, possibly
buried into pages of regulatory rulemaking or multiple statutes (Yackee and Yackee, 2006;
Bertrand, Bombardini, Fisman, Hackinen and Trebbi, 2018), heterogeneous, hardly comparable
across firms belonging to different sectors or even within the same industry.5

5

Kang (2016), one of the few empirical papers in the literature addressing the complexity of mapping policy
demand from textual components of U.S. House of Representatives statutes, provides an excellent example of the
intricacy of such exercise and produces a detailed blueprint of how to handle it.

3

It complicates things further that a policy demand by F may often be expressed in the negative,
in the form of blocking or stopping a specific legislative or administrative proposal, to the
advantage of an incumbent corporate beneficiary (Baumgartner, Berry, Hojnacki and Leech,
2009; Drutman, 2015). This is the case of safety controls (e.g. guns), extant trade subsidies (e.g.
non-tariff and tariff barriers) or tax exemptions covering arrays of products and goods (e.g. the
Farm Bill). As a consequence, in many instances what F obtains in the process of lobbying will
be invisible: to maintain a status quo ante, without any discernible change in the law.6
As a point of further clarification, it is important to emphasize here that, while our terminology
of a supply and demand of policy may seem to necessarily to imply a monetary exchange of
resources between F and P - what in special interest politics is called the quid-pro-quo
perspective, and in more lay terms may be described as corruption, this does not need to be the
case at all. Indeed, while much of the economic literature on lobbying, starting from the seminal
theoretical contributions of Grossman and Helpman (1994, 1996), has been centered on quidpro-quo lobbying, this is by far not the standard perspective in other disciplines, such as Political
Science and Sociology. Within these related fields, the perspective is informational.
Instead of payment for policy from F to P, original contributions such as Potters and van Winden
(1990, 1992), Austen-Smith (1994, 1995), Austen-Smith and Wright (1996), and Bennedsen and
Feldmann (2002), etc. have focused on issues of asymmetry of information and of expertise
between F to P (possibly via L or with L’s strategic intermediation). The informational
perspective is also the one taken by The National Institute for Lobbying & Ethics on behalf of its
members, the American lobbyists. It states: “Lobbying is a legitimate and necessary part of our
democratic political process. Government decisions affect both people and organizations, and
information must be provided in order to produce informed decisions. Public officials cannot
make fair and informed decisions without considering information from a broad range of
interested parties.”
From an informational perspective, additional layers of empirical complication arise from the
immaterial and hard-to-measure nature of what is transacted: information and messages, not
6

We will also observe how specific approaches to lobbying, such as in the case of all-pay auctions (Baye,
Kovencock de Vries, 1993; Che and Gale, 1998) or tournament approaches, will face a similar measurement
complication, as payment and exertion of lobbying efforts will not be met necessarily by policy rewards coming the
way of F.

physical goods or payments. This compounds to the difficulty of assessing the degree of bias and
measuring the incentives to lie for F or for any strategic intermediary L.
In terms of conceptual organization of the empirical research, this article will focus on the simple
dichotomy between empirical models focused on quid-pro-quo, where essentially F and P are on
even grounds in terms of informational symmetry, and informational models of lobbying, where
this symmetry is broken and where a biased, but more informed, F interacts with an uninformed
P. As it will become obvious, a natural skewness within Political Economy will emerge with
respect to the relative abundance of quid-pro-quo based model evidence versus informational
ones. This is not because empirical quid-pro-quo models are to be considered a better fit of
reality, but because, as we discuss, data on informational needs of agents and precise evidence on
transmission of expertise are extremely hard to come by. Hence, empirical models of lobbying
displaying informational effects are rarer.
As in many empirical politico-economic problems, in what follows we will also try to highlight
how the key to statistical identification may come from assessing shocks to the demand of policy
by F (to pin down parameters governing the policy supply). Or it may arise from shocks to the
supply by P (e.g. reelection or retirement of P, changes in the policy oversight portfolio of P,
etc.) to identify the parameters governing firm behavior. Finally, some sources of variation may
arise from exogenous changes affecting the technology related to the ability of L to intermediate
between F and P.
In Section 2, we will begin by providing an illustration of the several empirical tools available to
special interests in influencing policymakers and, as we describe the data available in the context
of each tool, we will also illustrate which information they can provide in the study of special
interest politics and lobbying. This step will be useful, because it will immediately disabuse the
reader from the notion that lobbying “proper” (that is, as defined by the Lobbying Disclosure Act
of 1995) encompasses the entirety of special interest politics or is even the bulk of the arsenal of
influence tools available and employed by corporations. Finally, due to its higher data quality,
amplitude of disclosure requirements, and advantageous sample size and coverage, our emphasis
will be the Unites States context, although we will touch a limited amount of empirical work on
Canada and lobbying in the European Union in Section 5.

5

In terms of the methodological approaches that we will review in this brief survey, the spectrum
will be wide. One of the interesting features of the empirical literature on lobbying is the variety
of empirical methodologies brought to bear to the study of special interest politics. The works
described in this article range from standard observational studies and regression analysis, to
quasi-experimental approaches, to structural econometric approaches. In fact, we will separate
quid-pro-quo structural models from reduced-form approaches. We hope the reader will find in
the variety of empirical angles discussed in Sections 2-4 a sense of the plasticity of the topic, in
fact borrowing from several fields within economics.7
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and overview of the lobbying data, their
coverage and limitations and links them to specific uses made of them in the literature. Sections
3 reviews work focused on identification of relevant dimensions of the political influence
process that emerge from quid-pro-quo approaches. It does so by focusing both on structural
econometric and reduced-form applications. Section 4 focuses on recent evidence pertinent to
informational models. Section 5 offers a brief perspective on empirical analysis focused on nonUS lobbying. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2. TOOLS AND DATA: AN OVERVIEW
Much of the empirical analysis of lobbying and special interest politics is focused on the United
States. The reason is simple: data. The United States jurisprudence has been at the frontier of
transparency and data availability since the 1970’s. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971
and its subsequent amendments have progressively imposed detailed requirements for campaign
finance disclosure on the side of both donors and recipients. Since its creation in 1974, the Federal
Election Commission is the primary source of data on campaign contributions by individuals and
Political Action Committees (PAC), although in recent years some notable efforts by non-profit
organization, chiefly the Center for Responsive Politics, have made the data much easier to access
7

Special interest politics is an area where intuition from Industrial Organization is useful to study the interaction of
multiple strategic special interest groups (Kang, 2016); intuition from structural and reduced-form labor economics
may be relevant in tracing the career choices of lobbyists or politicians (e.g. Diermeier, Keane and Merlo, 2005
where lobbying is an important of a congressional career); where the asymmetric informational complexities of
regulation may speak directly to environmental economics; where the financial gains from political connections or
the costs from policy uncertainty may touch themes relevant to financial economists (see Gutierrez and Philippon,
2019 on lobbying and misallocation).

6

and interpret. PAC and individual campaign contributions are the topic of the bulk of empirical
research in lobbying since the 1990’s.8 However, in the last ten years, empirical researchers have
turned their attention to a measure of interest group activity that is quantitatively much larger,
lobbying expenditures.9 What is behind the most exciting development on the data availability
front is the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, modified by the Honest Leadership and Open
Government Act of 2007. The Senate Office of Public Records (SOPR) is the primary source of
data, although CRP once again usefully organizes the data by industry and links it to other political
activities of firms. CRP makes the quantitative comparison of PAC and lobbying expenditures
easy. Total lobbying spending has oscillated between 3 and 3.5 billion dollars for the past ten years,
starting from 1.5 billions in 1998, whereas yearly PAC donations to candidates during the same
period varied between 200 and 250 million dollars.10
As emphasized by Milyo, Primo and Groseclose (2000) corporate PAC’s have received a
disproportionate amount of attention in the empirical literature due to their early availability. We
therefore concentrate on LDA lobbying data, which is the focus of much ongoing research.
However, before we do so, we would like to briefly refer to two phenomena that are growing in
size and that have not been the subject of close academic scrutiny. The first one is the rise of socalled Super PAC’s, created in the wake of the 2010 landmark “Citizens United vs FEC” U.S.
Supreme Court case. Firms and other organizations can now contribute unlimited amounts to these
“independent expenditure” groups as long as those groups do not coordinate with a specific
candidate’s campaign. There were only 83 Super PAC’s in 2010 for a total spending of $60
Millions, while in the 2018 electoral cycle close to 2,400 groups raised 1.5 billion and spent just
above $800 millions. The second, even harder-to-study and partially overlapping phenomenon is
the increasing use of what is referred to as “dark money”. “Social welfare” groups organized under
section 501(c)4 of the Internal Revenue Code can engage in political spending as long as it is not
the majority of their activity.11 Importantly, these groups are not required to disclose their donors.
8

For example, Snyder (1989).
The observation that lobbying expenditures dwarf PAC spending was made forcefully in Milyo, Primo and
Groseclose (2000)
10
It should be noted that committee fund raising and expenditures are much higher if we take into account
independent expenditures and independent expenditure-only committees (i.e. SuperPAC’s): the yearly amount raised
vary between 600 million and 1.5 billion dollars.
11
Other organizations such as 5019(c)5 and 501(c)6 (business groups) are also subjects to similar regulation, while
tax-exempt 501(c)3 are not allowed to engage in political spending.
9

7

CRP reported a peak of almost $320 million spent by such groups in 2012. Although quantitative
research in this area is inherently difficult, investigative reporting has made these entities hard to
ignore.12

Facts about Lobbyists
According to the LDA rules, lobbyists and lobbying firms13 are required to file an initial
registration for each client they serve and quarterly reports any time their lobbying-related income
exceeds $3,000 (in 2019). The quarterly reports indicate the name of the lobbying firm or lobbyist,
the client name, the total amount paid by the client, the names of the lobbyists who worked on
behalf of the client and the issues they worked on (a list of 79 pre-determined codes as of 2019
and specific bill numbers).
Bertrand, Bombardini and Trebbi (2014) document that during the period 1999 to 2008 about
37,000 individual lobbyists were active. CRP lists on average 12,537 unique lobbyists per year
between 1998 and 2019, varying from 10,417 in 1998 to a peak of 14,825 in 2007. The number
has been declining back to 11,654 in 2018.
The SOPR data also classify lobbyists according to whether they are in-house lobbyists (internal
lobbying) or whether they work for a lobbying firm that is representing another organization
(external lobbying). Bertrand, Bombardini and Trebbi (2014) show a decline over time in the share
of in-house lobbyists, from nearly 60 percent at the beginning of the sample period to less than 40
percent by the end. Growth in lobbying expenses over the sample period (about a 30 percent
increase) is almost entirely due to the growth of external lobbying, which doubled over the sample
period.
Another important source of information to determine lobbyists’ policy alignment and the
existence of political connections through past employment, for example as staff members, is
www.lobbyists.info. This website, which was originally derived from the directory “Washington
Representatives” and is maintained by Columbia Books & Information Services (CBIS), is the
most comprehensive source of information of the background of federal lobbyists. Bertrand,
Bombardini and Trebbi (2014) found that about 14,000 of the 37,000 active lobbyists had a profile

12

See Mayer (2017)
An individual is defined as lobbying on behalf of a client if the activity involves more than 20% of her time and
has more than one lobbying contact per disclosure period.

on the website and among those 11 percent had some association to the Republican party and about
10 percent to the Democratic party. Around 1 percent of the lobbyists were former members of
Congress while 2 percent of the biographies mentioned some experience in the White House.
Former aides were 11 percent of the sample.

Facts about Lobbying Clients
The LDA explicitly requires that the registrant file a separate report for each client, which can be
a firm, a non-corporate organization or an individual. The CRP led the effort to homogenize and
aggregate lobbying expenditures by clients, facing the difficulty of often misspelled client
names.
The CRP reports that in 2018 the largest spending was by industry associations, such as the US
Chamber of Commerce (almost $94 million), the National Association of Realtors and the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, together with 501(c)4 organization
Open Society Policy Center and large corporations such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield ($24 million),
Alphabet Inc and AT&T. The economics literature has focused on lobbying by firms, and
business interests more in general, because those entities tend to focus their lobbying not on
ideological issues, but on policies such as tariffs, subsidies, banking regulations and taxation that
have a key impact on the allocation of resources in the economy.
One of the first efforts to match firms to their political activity using Compustat North America
was Grier, Munger and Roberts (1994).14 Bombardini and Trebbi (2012) linked lobbying records
to Compustat’s corporations, but only for the subset of firms involved in lobbying for trade
issues. Richter, Samphantharak, and Timmons (2009) and Kerr, Lincoln and Mishra (2014)
performed a more comprehensive linking exercise covering a large portion of Compustat’s firms
lobbying on all issues. When it comes to linking lobbying records of public firms to standard
Compustat identifiers, such as gvkey’s, which in turn allows the researcher to link other firmlevel balance sheet variables, the state-of-the-art website is www.LobbyView.org, described in
detail in Kim (2018). The dataset is employed in Huneeus and Kim (2019), discussed later.

14

Bombardini (2008) undertook a similar effort for more recent PAC data.

9

Kerr, Lincoln and Mishra (2014) and Huneeus and Kim (2019) offer interesting stylized facts
about the lobbying behavior of public firms. First, lobbying is rare, and positively related to firm
size.15 According to Huneeus and Kim (2019) in 2017, of 7,646 U.S. public firms, 766 engaged
in lobbying. Lobbying firms have sales that are almost 4 times of those firms that do not lobby.
Conditional on lobbying, Huneeus and Kim (2019) show that the elasticity of lobbying
expenditure to total firm sales is around 1, confirming that size affects lobbying both at the
intensive and extensive margin. Second, lobbying is persistent: Kerr, Lincoln and Mishra (2014)
report that 92% of firms that lobby in a given year, also lobby in the next year.16 Such
persistence is explained by the presence of large sunk costs in setting up political presence.
Firms are not the only business-related entities that engage in lobbying. In fact smaller firms are
likely to participate through their membership in industry-wide organizations. This is a
phenomenon at the core of Bombardini and Trebbi (2012), who show that industries with lower
industry concentration and lower product differentiation tend to spend a higher share of the
lobbying expenditure through trade associations. Using more recent figures, Huneeus and Kim
(2019) confirm though the one by individual firms is the more prevalent form of lobbying.17

3 QUID-PRO-QUO LOBBYING
3.1 STRUCTURAL ECONOMETRIC APPROACHES TO QUID-PRO-QUO LOBBYING
There are important advantages in taking a structural approach to the empirical analysis of
lobbying. First, structural models require an explicit definition of the full set of theoretical
assumptions at the basis of the analysis. It forces the researcher to spell out precisely all relevant
features of the research problem, starting from its primitive parameters and data generating
process. In this sense, the structural approach requires clarity on what both F and P get out of
their exchange (quid pro quo). Second, the structural econometric approach requires a more
rigorous consideration of the theoretical assumptions, which need actual empirical validation to
15

Unsurprisingly, this is also the case for PAC contributions, as reported, among others, by Grier, Munger and
Roberts (1994) and Bombardini (2008).
16
Persistence of lobbying and its consequences is also at the core of Druttman (2015).
17
Bombardini and Trebbi (2012) report an average share of lobbying by individual firms of 67%, with a median of
96%. Huneeus and Kim (2019) report lobbying by business associations to be less than a quarter of all lobbying
expenses.

10

deliver sensible parameter estimates and in-sample fit. Most assumptions in empirical models
cannot merely pass intuitive/qualitative scrutiny, but must actually fit the data without inducing
nonsensical estimates along any dimension of the parameter space. Assumptions face immediate
discipline by the data (individually or jointly) and often can be verified and rejected. Finally,
structural approaches in Political Economy are not exclusively useful for counterfactual analysis
or out-of-sample prediction, but they can deliver certain parameter estimates that may be of
independent genuine research interest themselves. Some of these parameters, for example, are
the latent returns to lobbying or the unobserved fixed costs of political participation for a special
interest. We present a few notable examples in this section.
Kang (2016) offers one of the rare instances where equilibrium policy success, multiple lobbying
decisions by special interest groups in favor or against each policy dimensions (the quid of the
quid pro quo) and economic returns to lobbying are all, simultaneously modeled within the same
econometric framework. This nontrivial feat is accomplished first by presenting a detailed
measure for the outcome of the lobbying process in the context of U.S. energy sector: the
approval or rejection of a specific policy proposal (e.g. a solar energy production subsidy)
identified through the application of natural language processing (NLP) tools to congressional
bill texts. We underscore how, in order to keep the policy proposals relatively comparable with
each other, the author focuses on the energy policy, affecting an important, but tightly
circumscribed industry. In order to obtain a complete picture of failing and succeeding proposals,
the author focuses further on a single legislative term, the 110th Congress. And finally, to
precisely trace the ultimate fate of each policy, Kang decouples policies from the various
legislative bills “carrying” those policy proposals.18 The paper studies 538 policies that are
included in 445 bills requiring extensive NLP pre-analysis.
Kang (2016) frames the lobbying game as a series of contests among multiple special interests
for the policies adopted by one P. The set of F’s consists of four coalitions representing four

18

For instance, the author reports several instances where policy Q1 and Q2 are part of the same bill, the bill fails,
but then policy Q2 is carved out and added to a new bill, which then passes. Likely, omitting this refinement of the
data and focusing only on bill passage could lead to severe mismeasurement of the effects of lobbying. In essence,
just the preparatory data effort of Kang is substantial and the attention to institutional detail becomes crucial.
Political science researchers, such as Baumgartner et al. (2009) and other more qualitative studies of lobbying in
Congress, often make similar considerations.

11

different areas of economic interest (coal, oil and gas, nuclear, renewables). Kang further
assumes that within each coalition Olson (1965) collective action issues have been solved19.
From lobbying reports then the author links each special interest group to each policy, measuring
whether each F lobbies P on each policy and whether F supports or opposes it. Interestingly,
policies that are not associated with lobbying activity tends to be rarely enacted (1% of cases).
Policies where two or more players lobby are much more likely to pass (24%) and differentially
so depending whether all F’s are on the same side of the issue or not, implying substantial
selection in the data. Overall, only 8% of all policies are eventually enacted.
There is no informational role of lobbying in the model and the problem is a game of complete
information. Conditional on lobbying expenditures (s1,…,s4), this enactment probability is
modeled as a modification of the standard Tullock (1967) contest function, which is normally in
the form pi = (si)β/∑j(sj)β for generic nonzero expenditures (otherwise pi = 1 if sj≠i = 0 and si >0).20
The modifications to the context function applied by Kang allow for additional group parameters
modeling the effectiveness of lobbying against or in favor of a policy, and for a baseline
probability of enactment different from one, absent competition from other F’s.21
Under these assumptions, the subgame spending phase equilibrium where the vector (s1,…,s4) is
determined is unique given entry, but the entry decision phase displays multiplicity. Generally,
we only know that at least one mixed strategy equilibrium of the game exists. As necessary in the
structural estimation of models with multiple equilibria, the author imposes a selection argument
and focuses on the equilibrium that maximizes the sum of all the players’ payoffs as criterion.
Focusing on this specific equilibrium, Kang aims at recovering influence, baseline enactment
probabilities and cost parameters so to maximize the likelihood of observing the empirical policy
enactment, lobbying participation, and total lobbying expenditures recorded in the data. As
several equilibrium objects do not have a closed-form representation, simulation methods are
required for this.

19

This may not be always an appropriate assumption, even for specific issues such as trade policy. See Bombardini
and Trebbi (2014) and Kim (2017) for a discussion.
20
See also Baik (2008)
21
To further simplify the game, the author excludes issues of budget constraints for each special interest group
(realistically assumed to have deep pockets), to focus on the subgame perfect Nash equilibria of each
policy/lobbying game independently for the others, essentially treating them as independent games.

12

With parameter estimates at hand, the author can then simulate the equilibrium enactment
probability and the baseline passage probability in a scenario without lobbying for each policy,
conditional on the observable characteristics of the policy and lobbying coalitions. This is a
crucial counterfactual of the paper, aiming at the key questions of what are the effects of
lobbying. In fact, the difference between the enactment probability with and without lobbying
can be thought of as a dimension of the (model-dependent) effect of lobbying.
Surprisingly, here such effect is extremely small, between 0.021 and 0.415 percentage points
relative to a baseline of 8 percent enactment probability. While intuition could suggest that
lobbying efforts in favor and against enactment may be cancelling each other à la Becker (1983),
part of the problem is in the extreme insensitivity of the success likelihood at the margin, which
may be potentially indicate a form of model misspecification22. The author also estimates
average returns to lobbying in the range between 137% for Renewables and 152% for Oil and
Gas, which are conversely very high. This result emerges from an estimated average monetary
value of each policy of more than $500 Million, possibly another indication of some form of
misspecification.
Beyond Kang (2016), however, excessive political returns on political investments are common
in this literature. A second special interest politics paper following a structural approach offers a
possible explanation for this specific puzzle.
Bombardini and Trebbi (2011) presents a quid-pro-quo model of policy influence that is
structurally estimated on campaign contributions for the United States Congress. The paper
presents a model of multilateral bargaining across heterogeneous special interests F and a single
politician P. The authors emphasize how SIG donations may interact nonlinearly with the
electoral bloc of votes associated with that special interest, under the assumption of some
alignment of interests between workers and owners of capital (which is typically the case
through profit sharing or job security motives).

22

According to the structural estimates, 40% of the lobbying expenditures cancel out, so this cannot explain the null
enactment probability effect. Further, the effect of lobbying expenditures is small even when there are no opposing
interventions present. By highlighting along which dimensions the structure of the problem produces
counterintuitive estimates the paper offers the contribution of narrowing the spectrum of issues needing further
investigation. This is a benefit of the quantitative approach followed by Kang, rather than a weakness.

13

The paper’s first intuitive contribution is to highlight how special interest influence may be the
results of multiple tools employed simultaneously and with specific patterns of substitution
between them. In the analysis, the authors show how large special interests who carry a
substantial employment presence in a congressional district (and therefore have the power of
potentially swaying elections for House members through the mobilization of their employees)
may not have the necessity of providing much in the way of campaign contributions to obtain the
same policy benefit as electorally smaller groups. P will deliver the preferred policy by F, “or
else…”.
The evidence of access by large employers to local representatives is vast and lines up with
research on incentives for access and politics (Austen-Smith, 1995; Fouirnaies and Hall, 2018).
However, the authors report systematic inverse-U shaped relationships between the amount of
total campaign spending by sector in a congressional district and employment in a district by
industry (peaking at around 18,000 industry employees). The same relationship also holds within
industry, where total campaign spending across congressional districts concentrates in areas
where industry employment presence is neither too big, nor too small.
Such non monotonic relationships could be easily illustrated through simple nonparametric
reduced-form evidence. Here, however, the authors show the benefit of a structural approach by
recovering from the first-order conditions of political spending an estimate of the marginal rate
of substitution of campaign donations per vote acquired.23 This approach explicitly determines a
“dollar per vote” estimate between $200 and $400, depending on the specific district and media
market. Such costs are then used by the authors to determine the total economic value to the
politician of the special interest’s support and to recover a more precise estimate of the average
rate of returns on political spending.
The magnitude of such returns has been extensively debated. Ansolabehere, de Figueireido,
Snyder (2003) ask why is there so little money in American Politics relative to the economic
returns that one could infer from the economic magnitude of the discretionary policy programs
implemented by the U.S. government. Essentially, low amounts of campaign contributions and
the fact that federal campaign donations caps are very seldom binding stride in the face of the
23

More precisely, convinced through campaign spending. The paper relies on the intuition from Baron (1994) of a
fraction of voters to be susceptible of persuasion or “uninformed” to use the terminology of the original paper.

14

very large economic gains from government intervention. The implied (huge) rates of return
seem to suggest massive failure from entry and limits to arbitrage, a phenomenon known in the
literature as the Tullock’s puzzle –from the original discussion of Tullock (1972). A typical
example would be the Farm Bill in the United States. In 2000 it included $22 Billion of subsidies
to the U.S. agribusiness lobby vis-à-vis less than $3.7 Million in campaign contributions from
agribusiness special interest groups (PACs) during that electoral cycle. From this perspective,
this amounts to $6,000 of subsidies for every $1 of political contributions: A rate of return of
600,000%. This should strike the reader as obviously not economically reasonable (competition
in the political market should arbitrage away these rents).
The quantitative analysis in Bombardini and Trebbi (2011) shows that one of the reason for this
puzzle is that the Ansolabehere et al. approach typically counts political contributions as the only
channel of influence, while there may be multiple and less easy to measure ones. For instance, if
the electoral weight of a special interest group (its number of employees) is as important as a
channel of influence as campaign donations and the cost of buying a vote is relatively high,
implied returns for F appear much more reasonable when all is included.24
With the Kang’s or Bombardini and Trebbi’s political return estimates at hand, one is still short
of a welfare assessment or even policy efficiency considerations. What are the distortions
induced by these special interest activities relative to a hypothetical counterfactual where
lobbying were absent?
In a more recent contribution, Huneeus and Kim (2019) offer an answer to this key question by
studying input misallocation due to political influence activity in the United States. The authors
focus on the question on whether lobbying, which may be employed by specific firms and with
different intensity, may be a relevant quantitative mechanism for the creation of wedges between
marginal return and marginal cost of input (specifically capital), inducing politically influential
firms to grow larger. This is a crucial question in the study of special interest politics, as the

24

Mobilizing the 4 million farmers and agribusiness-connected voters in 2000 surely had a political value. Under
this perspective, the rate of return to political activity of the agricultural special interest $22 Billion / ($3.7 Million +
$400*4 Million) = $13.7 for every dollar of political contributions at the margin. While still a high figure, it appears
as already a more reasonable estimate for the case of agriculture (i.e. not $6,000). In fact, the paper provides
evidence from simulations of average returns to political donations in the range of 10-20% per year. Notice that
these considerations are a clear benefit of structurally modeling lobbying as they are based on estimated primitives
from the theory.

15

accumulation of political influence may feed into economic distortions and rent creation. The
acquisition of rents fostered by lobbying further feeds back on the resources available for
political influence and regulatory capture, in a vicious cycle where profits, anticompetitive
pressures, and political clout self-reinforce and perpetuate (Gutierrez and Philippon, 2019).
Huneeus and Kim (2019) present a general equilibrium model augmented by a structural
framework to allow a precise estimate of the magnitudes of these distortions. This structural
approach is based on a model with heterogeneous firms, which have to pay a fixed cost to play a
political influence game and subsequently invest a continuous amount on lobbying based on their
expected policy returns. The heterogeneity of firms is governed by a multidimensional vector of
productivity and lobbying capacity draws (more precisely, a Hicks-neutral productivity term, a
lobbying productivity term, and an exogenous wedge type draw). The estimator is first
implemented by having a subset of parameters normalized and calibrated. Then, the model is
simulated for a certain parameter vector value, including the fixed costs, the variances and
covariances of the types distribution, and the returns to lobbying (these are the parameters to be
estimated). Drawing from the data generating process, the model produces a series of simulated
moments that then can be matched to the data. The empirical moments include the share of firms
who lobby for each industry, the dispersion of firm sales within industry (which relates to
productivity dispersion), and the relationship between lobbying spending and firm size, which is
identified through congressional committee shocks. As typical in this literature, a minimum
distance estimator based on the difference between simulated and actual moments is employed.
Although theoretical identification (uniqueness of the parameter vector minimizing the criterion)
is not assured (and it should be probed by Monte Carlo simulations), the solution proposed by
the authors appears stable.
Methodologically, as firm lobbying activities are endogenous to an entire roster of other
economic activities driving revenues, the authors focus on identifying a credible shock to
lobbying productivity. As it is necessary to emphasize, structural methods are dependent on solid
identifying variation as much as reduced-form approaches and therefore this first step is
essential. The authors here rely on policy supply shocks: the idiosyncrasies of congressional
committee assignments, which vary the specific value of a local political representative to a firm.
This form of identification strategy is common in this literature (see the discussion in the

16

following subsection and Powell and Grimmer, 2016) and relies on the fact that many of the
committee membership changes happening in the U.S. Congress are related to party seniority,
majority party status, and other presumably exogenous determinants with respect to firm
decisions.25
Using this identification strategy, the authors show that a 10 percent increase in lobbying
produces a 3 percent increase in revenue. Notice that the exact measurement of which policies
are distorted and by how much is not provided. Nonetheless, the estimated model can be
ultimately tweaked to answer the counterfactual questions, including shutting down the
availability of lobbying and re-computing the model’s equilibrium choices and firm size
distributions. Firms’ federal lobbying is estimated to induce a 22 percent reduction in aggregate
productivity in the United States. This is a large negative general equilibrium effect. In addition,
59 percent of this reduction is determined by misallocation of resources to lobbying firms (which
are less productive) and 41 percent due to lack entry of new more productive firms.

3.2 REDUCED-FORM ECONOMETRIC APPROACHES TO QUID-PRO-QUO
LOBBYING
A quid-pro-quo approach to lobbying frames the problem essentially as an exchange of political
resources for policy adoption. All the structural papers mentioned in the previous section need to
specify explicitly what F demands from P and at what cost and what P is willing to supply to F
and to what personal benefit.
This coincidence of policy demand and supply needs not to be resolved through a competitive
political market where prices are posted, and most likely it is not.26 Sacrificing realism, it is
25

To be more precise, first the authors connect large public firms and their employment base to certain politician
(U.S. Senators representing states where firms have their headquarters). Then, they consider the set of policy issues
relevant to those firms among the set of their connected politicians and use shocks to this set to obtain variation to
the productivity of lobbying for each firm. Such shocks include how issues relevant to firms vary over time relative
(e.g. liability issues for tobacco manufacturers) to the set of politicians to whom the firm may have an electoral
connection (e.g. a local senator sitting on the Congressional Judiciary Committee), or how the set of politicians to
whom the firm is electorally relevant vary as Congress members move in or out of congressional committees
relevant for those firms’ policy issues (the value of the same senator moving from the Congressional Judiciary
Committee to Armed Services).
26
In fact, some of the early approaches to policy for sale were designed as menu auctions (Grossman and Helpman,
1994) and other quid-pro-quo models rely on bargaining (Goldberg and Maggi, 1999; Bombardini and Trebbi,
2011).

17

nonetheless useful to present a minimal framework of supply and demand akin to a standard
partial equilibrium setting to clarify the different perspective taken by the recent reduced-form
papers that we study. Much of the work on reduced-form empirical lobbying that we will discuss
in this section focuses either on shocks to F that drive up or down the demand for policy or on
shocks on P, which determine the supply of policy for every dollar of lobbying spent.
Assume a stylized functional form for the demand for a policy objective 𝑄𝐷 = 𝐴𝑝−𝜀 by F and its
supply 𝑄𝑆 = 𝐵𝑝𝜂 by the policy maker, P, assuming linear pricing and that 𝑝 is a per unit price of
the policy. Typically, this price 𝑝 will not be a variable that the econometrician observes, so we
need to transform this demand system into a system of revenue (or political expenditure) and
quantity. Thus, let us define by 𝑙 = 𝑝𝑄 the total amount spent on lobbying, which is the variable
we normally observe in federally disclosed reports. We can simply derive demand and supply
equations in terms of 𝑙 and 𝑄: 𝑙𝐷 = 𝐶𝑄1−1/𝜀 and 𝑙𝑆 = 𝐺𝑄1+1/𝜂 . It is easy to verify that, if 𝜀 > 1
(the elasticity of demand is larger than one), then both schedules will be upward sloping, as
depicted in Figure 1.
Using this framework, it is straightforward to reinterpret, for example, policy demand shifters as
useful sources of identification to measure 𝜕𝑄𝑆 /𝜕𝑙𝑆 . This is consequential as it allows to answer
the question of how much “policy” an extra dollar of lobbying buys. This is, of course, also
closely related to the parameter 𝜂, since an extremely low value of 𝜂 implies that policy is
essentially “not for sale” and

𝜕𝑄
𝜕𝑙

𝑙

𝜂

× 𝑄 = 1+𝜂 approaches zero.

In Figure 1 an increase in the demand for policy, caused by a shift in the parameter 𝐶 helps to
identify parameters of 𝑙𝑆 . Such identifying variation is clearly related to the policy needs of firm
F (such as the demand of protection from foreign competition in presence of adverse
technological or financial shocks27). Similarly, reduced-form papers related to the demand of
lobbying services (ultimately related to the demand of policy 𝑙𝐷 ) can be identified by shifts in 𝑙𝑆 .
Shocks to politicians P (such as sudden jumps in the ability of a local representative to deliver
pork to his constituency) are going to be the key for identification along this dimension.

27

For instance see Adelino and Dinc (2014) and Faccio, Masulis, and McConnell (2006).

Figure 1: Demand and Supply for Policy Variable Q

Policy Supply and Identification through Shocks to F
The concept of identifying policy supply conditions through firm demand shifters is exemplified
by De Figueiredo and Silverman (2006). They study the process by which universities (special
interests that for all intents and purposes here will be considered equivalent to F) lobby to obtain
federal earmark grants. The authors specify a policy demand side in which universities decide
how much to invest in lobbying expenditures based on its expected productivity in obtaining
grants. In fact, the authors set out to estimate a parameter of the production function for
earmarks, namely the productivity of lobbying expenditures. As anticipated before, one can
reinterpret this parameter as a policy supply characteristic, in that it is related to the inverse of
the supply slope, i.e. 𝜕𝑄𝑆 /𝜕𝑙𝑆 and to the effect of an additional dollar of lobbying the amount of
earmark grants won by the university.
To obtain identification, the authors exploit the fact that different universities face different
overhead rates. High overhead rates make grants more valuable for a university, because the
institution retains a higher percentage of the grant to cover university-wide costs. Therefore,
higher overheads induce a shift in the demand for the policy, which can then be used to estimate
how public policy responds to lobbying. In a first stage regression, lobbying expenditures are
significantly predicted by overhead rates. According to a second stage regressions De Figueiredo
and Silverman cannot reject the hypothesis that an extra dollar of lobbying yields a one dollar

19

increase in earmarks for those universities without any representation in the Senate or House
Appropriations Committees (that is, without a politician representing the electoral constituency
in which the university is located). For universities with connections to the Appropriations
Committees, the extra dollar spent on lobbying yields between $4.52 and $5.24 additional
earmarks, suggesting that the supply of earmarks is not independent of lobbying efforts.
A similar pattern of behavior is found in the lobbying activity of U.S. cities set to obtain
additional federal funding. Goldstein and You (2017) study cities of population greater than
25,000 in the period between 1999 and 2012. As identifying variation the authors rely on the
mismatch in terms of political control between the city and the corresponding state budgetary
authority (say, a Democratic party controlled city in a Republican controlled state, possibly at
odds with each other). Such political mismatch appears to induce a substantial under provision of
funding for local public goods supply. Lobbying the federal government, then, is the result of the
city government trying to complement through access to discretionary federal grants and
earmarks such funding deficit. Differently from the case of universities, it is unclear from the
paper whether this political influence effort on the part of municipal governments is entirely
successful. Based on an instrumental variable estimates28, the approximate return for $1 of
lobbying spent estimated by Goldstein and You is $1.02 for earmarks and $0.47 for 2009
Economic Recovery Act grants, the two outcome measures considered by the authors.29
It is, however, worth remarking one specific issues raised by Goldstein and You: federal
lobbying in this case may be benign and efficiency enhancing, in the sense of actually being
effective at rebalancing the distortions induced by the political opposition between city and state
governments. This is an issue, for instance, if the equilibrium absent lobbying is further from the
social optimum due to distortions from partisan frictions.30
Kerr, Lincoln and Mishra (2014) describe a shock to the demand side of policy in the specific
context of work visa caps. They exploit the pre-determined expiry of a temporary H1B visa cap

28

The authors employ geographic distance from Washington DC as their IV. This is a common identification
approach, used for similar instances in Igan, Mishra and Tressel (2009) and Lambert (2019), but arguably subject to
criticism from a standpoint of exclusion restriction.
29
A cumulate measure of total federal transfers to the municipality should be employed to precisely estimate the
effective rate of return to lobbying and the supply elasticity. Unfortunately, this is not considered in the article.
30
Such frictions can take many forms, including inefficient policy enactment or lack of response to crises. See also
Mian et al. (2010, 2013) for how electoral constituencies may not be effective in preventing this.

to study the reaction in the lobbying effort by firms differentially affected by the cap reduction.
Firms are classified as dependent on high-skill immigration based on the ethnic composition of
their innovators and their past filings to the Department of Labor of Labor Condition
Applications.31
The authors find that, after the visa cap reduction, F’s lobbying focused on high-skill
immigration doubles as a share of total lobbying. Firms classified as high-skill-immigrationdependent under the paper’s criteria increase their lobbying and the effect is much stronger for
those firms that lobbied in the past on any issue (not just immigration). The authors attribute this
persistency to a large initial fixed cost for firms to start lobbying, compared to the fixed cost of
lobbying on a specific issue such as immigration. As we have seen in Section 2, such fixed costs
appear a realistic dimension of the data.32

Policy Demand and Identification through Shocks to P
Shocks to the ability of P to deliver policy favorable to F are ideal sources of identification for
tracing the profile of F’s policy demand function. In addition, as firms demand policy favors and
because policy favors require lobbying efforts, firms will demand services by lobbyists (L). This
section will present a few reduced-form applications that operate in this space and show the
identification role of shocks to P in this case. It will also show how information on the market for
L may be ultimately useful for learning about 𝑙𝐷 .33
In the group of papers estimating the effects of shocks to political targets P on lobbying, Blanes i
Vidal, Draca, and Fons-Rosen (2012) is remarkable for its simplicity and sharpness. The article
investigates the value of political connections in lobbying by estimating the revenue loss
experienced by former Senate staffers-turned-lobbyists when the Senator for whom they worked
exits politics. To be more precise, the authors evaluate how ex-government officials convert their

LCA’s are necessary to hire a worker under the H-1B visa program.
More generally, these results have also important implications about the dangers of policy hysteresis and lack of
representation in a system where entry costs are prohibitive for a large fraction of the entities affected by policy.
33
We wish to point out that the use of shocks to P may also be useful to detect more subtle and opaque forms of
political influence. Bertrand, Bombardini, Fisman, and Trebbi (2018) present evidence that this may be the case for
political charitable giving by S&P and Fortune 500 corporations, for example, based on the changes in the direction
of their grants. The authors estimate about $2.9 Billion of political charitable giving per year.

21

acquired political connections into lobbying revenues and, through this, they can produce an
inference of the market valuation for political connections by corporate clients.34 The
econometric framework is extremely terse: A difference-in-differences setting where the exit of
the politician is considered exogenous to the revenue dynamics of ex-staffers. Essentially, those
lobbyists who lost a political connection are being compared with ex-staffers who did not. We
notice here that the authors’ working assumption is that the events driving the exit of Senators
being orthogonal to the fortunes of their connected lobbyists, a strong assumption, if one
considers that Senators may strategically retire whenever their party’s fortunes are turning.
In a key finding, revolving-door lobbyists, i.e. the former aides turned lobbyists, experience a
persistent 24% drop in lobbying revenues when a connected US Senator exits office. Further, exstaffers are also less likely to become lobbyists if their patron exits the Senate. Losses in
lobbying revenue vary intuitively with the political power of the Senator: Lobbyists connected to
Senator in the powerful Finance and Appropriations Committees or the Ways and Means
Committee have bigger drops in revenues at exit, while lobbyists having connections outside
these committees have statistically insignificant drop in revenues.35
Political shifters are also useful in answering broader special interest politics questions about the
market for L. “What do lobbyists exactly do?” is one of these questions. As mentioned in the
Introduction, some believe that lobbyists mainly provide the firms and other special interests
they represent with access to politicians in their “circle of influence” and essentially help
facilitate vote-buying. Others believe that lobbyists’ main role is to provide information and
expertise to congressmen to guide the legislative decision-making process (at the very least,
lobbyists trade associations promote this view). Bertrand, Bombardini and Trebbi (2014)
evaluate the relative economic importance of these two views of lobbying.
The authors’ main empirical approach consists in asking whether L mainly “sticks to” P, as a
political connection a la Blanes i Vidal et al., or whether L mainly “sticks to” specific policy
issues. If lobbyists provide companies with access to politicians within their “circle of

34

As standard, revenues generated by lobbyists from each client are obtained from reports compiled by the CRP
from SOPR. The directory www.lobbyist.info is instead used to obtain career history and other observable
characteristics (gender, education, etc.) of lobbyists, while the data on former staffers is obtained from
Congressional Staffer Salaries database maintained and published from LegiStorm 2012.
35
Surprisingly such effects are also insignificant for staffers-turned-lobbyists in the House of Representatives.

22

influence,” one would expect lobbyists’ job assignments to be determined mostly by the identity
of the politicians, independently of the specific issues being decided upon. A logical implication
is then that a lobbyist should “follow” a closely connected congress member as she or he moves
from one committee assignment to another. In contrast, if L mainly provides expertise, one
would expect L to be much more strongly attached to specific issues of competence (and hence
specific committees or subcommittees), independently from which P’s populate them or whether
P moves.
The authors find evidence of lobbyists taking up new issues as the politicians they have been in
contact with in the past change committee assignment, which is consistent with a relationshipbased view of lobbying. Similarly, they also find that the return premium to being an expert in an
issue does not increase when the issue becomes more relevant in Congress. These facts point
towards an economic dominance of political access motives over expertise.36
When further sub-sampling the data, the authors find that lobbyists for whom access should be
relatively more important in the political market (for instance, former members of Congress
turned lobbyists) are more likely to follow their politicians. Moreover, when a new politician is
assigned to a congressional committee, it appears that the lobbyists that are active on that
committee take steps to gain access to this new politician (in particular in the form of
contributions to the politician’s campaign), which is inconsistent with a pure expertise view of
lobbying.
Another paper focusing on political shifts to assess influence is DellaVigna, Durante, Knight,
and La Ferrara (2016). The paper examines an indirect channel of lobbying to curry favor from
conflicted politicians.
Silvio Berlusconi, an Italian politician and media tycoon, was the Italian PM for three terms
during the period 1993-2009. His fluctuating political fortunes and movement in and out of
office as Italian premier offer the identifying variation at the basis of this article. Market-based
lobbying – to use the terminology coined by the authors – takes place by regulated firms via
shifting their advertising spending onto Mediaset (Mr. Berlusconi’s firm) TV channels (and

36

This is not to say that the paper does not find evidence of a market value for expertise, which is in fact precisely
estimated in the data. See also our further discussion in Section 4.

23

away from others avenues of commercial advertising) during Berlusconi’s periods in office. P, in
this application, transitions in and out of power and so do Mediaset advertising revenues.
The authors conjecture that the strategic channeling of advertising spending underlies a quid-proquo in exchange for regulatory lenience. In fact, the paper establishes that the strategic shifting
of ad spending is exclusive pertinence of firms in heavily regulated industries. Moreover, the
large amounts of advertising spending, running in the hundreds of millions of Euros, make for an
economically relevant channel.37
To conclude, the discussion about market-based lobbying connects also to a broader literature on
identifying the value of political connections for firms. This empirical literature is vast and has in
Fisman (2001), Khwaja and Mian (2005), Faccio (2006) some of its earliest and most striking
empirical applications. Pertaining more closely to lobbying, Borisov, Goldman and Gupta (2016)
focus on the negative shock originating from the 2006 Jack Abramoff legal scandal and the loss
of value for corporations engaged in lobbying around that event.

4. INFORMATIONAL LOBBYING: THEORY VS MEASUREMENT
An area of research that has seen slow progress is the one measuring and providing evidence in
favor of informational lobbying. The starting point for this approach is a view dear to interest
groups and lobbyists themselves and that is that policy making is complicated and therefore that
P can benefit from receiving information from F, even though such entities have an incentive to
skew the information transmitted to the policy maker. There is a rich and nuanced theoretical
literature that provides a variety of mechanisms that find a positive role played by
communication between F and P. After a brief summary of these theories, we move on to the
thornier question of whether the data support the predictions of these theories. The short answer
is that the evidence points to some form of information being supplied, but not all the evidence
lines up with the type of information that is beneficial to the public at large.

37

To the skeptical reader, we remark that to curry favor in such not-so-subtle fashion is paradoxically legal in Italy,
due to the absence of a conflict of interest statute (often debated by parties in opposition to Silvio Berlusconi during
his periods in power, but never enacted).

24

Models of informational lobbying start from the premise that the policy maker is less informed
than the interest group, but at the same time she understands that she cannot take the information
that F passes to her at face value because it will always tend to distort the information in its
favor. There are two broad categories of models: cheap talk models and costly lobbying models.
In cheap talk models some information can be credibly revealed only in a “rough” way. An
interest group can rarely communicate exactly the value of some important variable, but can
communicate whether such value lies in a range.38 The boundaries of such range are given by the
group’s incentive to lie. The more aligned its preferences are with the policy maker’s, the more
precise the information communicated (Krishna and Morgan, 2001 and Grossman and Helpman,
2001). In the presence of multiple interest groups, this theory predicts a welfare-enhancing role
of groups with opposite biases relative to the policy maker preferences, because it induces a less
coarse information transmission.39 This is a result we will refer to later in this section.
In contrast, theories of costly lobbying are essentially money-burning models where lobbying
expenditures serve the purpose of signaling the underlying state of the world to the politician.
Potters and van Winden (1992) is an early example where such lobbying costs are fixed and
exogenous, but Grossman and Helpman (2001) illustrate how the logic easily extends to
lobbying costs that are chosen by the interest group: the higher the cost chosen, the more extreme
must be the underlying variable that the policy maker needs to learn about. The important
predictions of these models is that welfare can be higher for all parties involved, even when
lobbying is an inherently wasteful activity. This welfare result carries through to more
sophisticated hybrid models where talk is cheap, but there is a fee for access that can coarsely
signal the otherwise unknown preference of the interest group (Lohmann, 1995 and AustenSmith, 1995). A related, but distinct theory of lobbying is offered by Hall and Deardorff (2006),
who hypothesize that information plays the role of a subsidy to otherwise resource-strapped
legislators.40

38

Full revelation is easier to achieve if information and the policy space are multi-dimensional as in Battaglini
(2002), but there are exceptions. We do not discuss here this voluminous literature.
39
The intuition here is that each interest group can credibly communicate in a separate section of the underlying
variable and therefore the information becomes more detailed.
40
Their theory explains why lobbyists appear to lobby friendly legislators and questions the persuasion role of the
process. Schnakenberg (2016) revives the persuasive role of lobbying by postulating that the information provided
by interest groups to friendly legislators can be used to persuade their less friendly colleagues.

25

Let us now turn to whether this potentially virtuous interaction of interest groups with policy
makers is supported by the available empirical evidence. It is obviously inherently difficult to
measure information exchanges, where what is said by firms to politicians is often not known.
This scarcity compounds the already-cited difficulties common to quid-pro-quo studies in
measuring policy variables (i.e. the “output” of the lobbying process).
It is because of these difficulties that the evidence we have so far about the extent of
informational lobbying is very indirect. One of the ways in which researchers had to creatively
circumvent these availability and measurement issues is to look elsewhere for clues about
informational lobbying. One example is the intermediary of much lobbying activity, i.e. the
lobbying industry. These papers are interesting in their own right because they address the
presence of an intermediary that finds no role in the established literature on informational
lobbying. But by looking at how the intermediaries behave, they are also able to shed some light
on what their clients and their targets are exchanging.
The role assigned to the lobbying industry by recent papers like Groll and Ellis (2014, 2017) and
Hirsch, Kang, Montagnes and You (2019) is essentially one of information verification. This
adds one more layer to the information transmission by inserting a middleman, that either
through reputation or shared preferences, is credible to the politician and can verify or filter some
of the information. Because the paper offers nice empirical support to the theory, we focus on
Hirsch, Kang, Montagnes and You (2019). The data combines newly collected and available
information on contacts between 219 lobbyists representing foreign interests and members of
Congress during the 110th and 111th Congress. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA)
makes reporting requirements for these lobbyists stricter compared to the LDA. In particular,
reports must include the identity of the member of Congress (or her staffer) contacted. The
authors explore the relationship between ideological closeness and lobbying contacts by
supplementing these data with measures of ideology based on party affiliation,41 DW Nominate
scores and campaign finance-based scores from DIME (Bonica, 2016).
The most interesting empirical regularities that emerge are: i) the presence of any lobbying
contact is more likely for lobbyists that are more ideologically aligned with politicians; ii)

41

Party affiliation is collected from Washington Representatives available at lobbyistinfo.com

26

conditional on the lobbyist having any contact with the politician, she brings him fewer clients
when her ideology is more similar to the politician’s and when she has a prior connection to a
Member of Congress.
The first empirical finding echoes the familiar pattern that interest groups tend to lobby friendly
legislators (Salisbury et al., 1989; Snyder 1990, 1991 and 1992), a fact that has been invoked
often in the theoretical literature as a validation of the common prediction that communication is
credible only if the preferences of sender and receiver are sufficiently aligned (Helpman, 2001,
ch.5). The second empirical result is more nuanced and is partially explained by the model.
Lobbyists that are ideologically closer42 or connected through past employment to politicians set
a higher “certification threshold”: the case brought to them by the interest group has to be more
favorable to the politician in order to gain representation from the lobbyist. We will return to the
difference between these two findings after reviewing another set of results that speak to the
informational view of lobbying in Bertrand, Bombardini and Trebbi (2014). In that paper, as
previously discussed, the focus was distinguishing between connections and expertise as a source
of returns to lobbying. Although the main message of the paper is that connections seem to be
driving a lot of the patterns of mobility and returns to lobbying, the authors do not rule out that
information was still important in the activity of lobbyists. Let us again point to two specific
results. The first is that, whenever politicians do have contacts with those lobbyists that we
classified as experts (based on how concentrated their lobbying work was on a specific topic),
those lobbyists have a more balanced distribution in terms of party affiliation than the nonexperts. This indirectly validates one of the key predictions of informational lobbying models
with multiple senders. In those models listening to senders with opposing “biases” generates a
better informed P.
The second relevant finding in Bertrand, Bombardini and Trebbi (2014) is that the returns to
lobbyists affiliated (through past employment as staffers for example) with a given party move
with the party’s fortune in terms of control of the two Chambers of Congress and of the
Presidency.

42

The model actually predicts that selectivity increases as the ideological distance between the interest group and
the lobbyist increases, but such fine prediction is difficult to take to the data.

27

We believe there is a subtle, but important, distinction to be drawn between the two types of
information that these distinct findings point to. While there is information that leads to overall
better policy for the general population, there is another type of information that is particularly
beneficial to a specific politician or her constituency. While some of these findings can be
reconciled with a view where lobbying is a vehicle for communicating information that is useful
to maximize general welfare (the first finding discussed above in Bertrand, Bombardini and
Trebbi, 2014), it seems that lobbyists accumulate reputation not only in communicating the truth,
but also in filtering the dimensions of a given policy proposal that are more salient for a specific
politician’s (electoral) success. It is otherwise hard to justify why connections are so important in
Bertrand, Bombardini and Trebbi (2014) and why more politically aligned lobbyists are more
selective in Hirsch et al. (2019).
We conclude this section with a discussion of some recent work that makes use of one of the few
comprehensive data sources where the content of messages sent to the policy maker are available
to researchers. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 formalized the rulemaking
process in the US by dictating that all Federal agencies publish a preliminary version of all rules
“designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy” on the Federal Register and allow
time for comments by interested parties. The APA also prescribes that agencies take address
these comments when formulating the final version of these rules. Some earlier work on the
subject by Yackee and Yackee (2006) has made use of the content of comments to 40 rules by 4
agencies to detect a tendency of those agencies to incorporate changes advocate by businesses,
relative to non-business commenters. In a recent paper, Bertrand, Bombardini, Fisman,
Hackinen and Trebbi (2019) exploit advances in NLP to automate and extend the analysis to a
large share of the comments made publicly available by 150 U.S. Federal agencies. Although the
focus of the study is the relationship between firms’ commenting patterns and that of non-profits
recipients of the firms’ philanthropic giving, the study showcases the potential for the use of
NLP in the study of informational lobbying. For example, the authors detect, by using latent
semantic analysis43 that the similarity between the content of comments by a non-profit and its
benefactor increases in the time immediately after a donation occurs. A similar technique is used

43

Latent semantic analysis is an established technique that reduces a body of text to a vector of word frequencies
and measures the “distance” between texts after further reducing the dimensionality of the vectors via singular value
decomposition.

28

in showing how such co-commenting is associated with an increase in similarity between the
firm’s comment and the final rule discussion by the agency. While it is currently hard to pinpoint
the welfare effect of these messages, or even the exact degree to which policy is affected by
these messages, this promises to be a rich path to explore information transmission.

5. LOBBYING OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES: CANADA AND THE E.U.
Lobbying in Canada
Canada passed its Lobbyist Registration Act in 1989, amended by the Lobbying Act of 2008
which strengthened revolving-door provisions and instituted more severe punishment for
violations. The Registry of Lobbyists, overseen by the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying
of Canada has been active since 1996. The Registry reports similar data to the US LDA database,
with information on clients, registrants and topics discussed. However, the Registry imposes
disclosure of the public officials contacted, a feature common to the E.U. registry, but different
from the US. Another major difference is the lack of data on fees paid to lobbyists, a feature that
makes comparisons in terms of the overall activity with the U.S. difficult. The number of
lobbyists engaged offers one comparable dimension. The Commissioner’s 2017-18 annual report
counts 9,000 lobbyists, with just above 1,000 being external lobbyists and the rest being inhouse. This is in stark contrast with the more developed “external” lobbying industry in the US,
which we discussed earlier. The sheer number of lobbyists, however, is comparable to the 11,654
count in the U.S. for the same year.
A very small number of academic papers has made use of the Registry data and in the context of
specific policy issues, such as international trade (Stoyanov, 2009). An exception is work by
Hickey (2014) who finds a much smaller importance of connections in Canadian lobbying
compared to Bertrand, Bombardini, and Trebbi (2014), as only 6% of Canadian lobbyists tend to
“follow” ministers who are reshuffled to different Cabinet positions.44
Lobbying in the E.U.

44

The lesser importance of connections in Canada may be due to the fact in a Parliamentary system like Canada
parties tend to be more important and personal connections to individual ministers may not be a key asset.

29

Individual European countries have almost no systems to record the activity of lobbyists.
According to Transparency International (2015), of the 19 countries examined, only 7 have laws
or regulations specifically regulating lobbying activities (Austria, France, Ireland, Lithuania,
Poland, Slovenia and the United Kingdom). Although those 7 countries plus the European
Commission have a registry, none of them have a mandatory registration requirement and there
is no strict enforcement mechanism or oversight. The only measures that appear with some
frequency in individual countries are revolving door provisions aimed at reducing public
officials’ incentives to direct policies in directions favorable to future prospective employers.
Arguably the most important effort in improving the public’s knowledge of the organizations
trying to influence E.U.-level policy decisions is the registry set up by the Interinstitutional
Agreement between the European Commission and the European Parliament in 2011.The
voluntary Transparency Register, managed by the Joint Transparency Register Secretariat, has
seen a steady increase in registrants, from 5431 in 2012 to 11,901 in 2018. Although the registry
is voluntary, there are incentives to register in order to have access to both the European
Parliament’s premises and to meetings with Commissioners, Cabinet members and DirectorsGeneral. As of the spring of 2019, a mandatory version of the registry was under discussion.
Similarly to the SOPR data, the Register collects reports (albeit less frequently filed) by
registrants, which can be lobbyists or law firms working on behalf of clients, or the organizations
themselves. It reports lobbying expenditures less precisely (in bins rather than specific amounts)
and has a space for the topics and legislation object of lobbying, as well the names of the
lobbyists with formal accreditation. The registry also includes a record of the firms or
organizations on whose behalf a lobbying firm works. An important difference relative to the US
data, the registry, similarly to the Canadian counterpart, reports a list of meetings with
commissioners and other public office holders.
The amounts are substantial. The Register reports for example that Apple has spent in 2018
between €2 and €2.25 Million to lobby the European Commission and the European Parliament
and employed 3.8 full time equivalents. By comparison, it spent $6.7 Million in the US. Royal
Dutch Shell spent €4.5-4.75 Million, while it spent almost $9 Million in the US. Similarly to the
US, firms can lobby directly or through a lobbying firm. The largest registrant in terms of
lobbying expenditure is FTI Consulting Belgium, a subsidiary of a K-street firm, which reported

30

in 2018 close to €7 Million in lobbying costs, quite distant from the top lobbying firm Akin,
Gump et al. which declared $37 Million revenues in 2018. These numbers show that although
the institutionalization of lobbying activities may be slow, the value of the lobbying activities in
the EU is of considerable magnitude.
Due to the voluntary nature of the Transparency Register and the lack of historical data,
academic empirical research on lobbying using EU lobbying reports has been scarce. 45 A recent
paper by Dellis and Sondermann (2017) has undertaken the task of matching the lobbying
activity of firms in register with other balance sheet and industry affiliation from Orbis of Bureau
van Dijk. The authors are able to find around 2000 firms in the Orbis database, which, should be
noted, covers more than publicly traded firms (differently from Compustat). It is therefore not
obvious how to compare, in terms of the frequency of lobbying, the almost 800 firms from
Compustat identified as lobbying by Huneeus and Kim (2019) and this sample.

6. CONCLUSIONS
This paper offers a brief Political Economy overview of recent empirical approaches to the study
of special interests politics and lobbying. After a substantial amount of theoretical effort in the
1990s and 2000s on the role and effects of lobbying, careful data work is at this point moving
forward the research frontier.
After presenting the main sources of available information and the crucial data disclosure issues,
we organize the research between quid-pro-quo and informational work. In the context of quidpro-quo approaches, we also try to emphasize the few research applications where both policy
supply and demand are resolved simultaneously - our preferred perspective to the study of the
political behavior of firms. We discuss how some of the approaches reviewed in this article allow
to explicitly tackle counterfactual policy outcomes under no lobbying. Ultimately, the welfare
effects of lobbying and corporate advocacy should be studied under this perspective. Yet, it
seems fair to say, they are still only partially understood and some of the structural modeling
displays symptoms of misspecification.

45

Greenwood and Dreger (2013) provide an early description of the data and shows that the majority of lobbying
entities are businesses or trade associations, with a small fraction of professional lobbyists relative to the US.

31

The benefits of studying lobbying are high. Income and wealth inequality have been increasing
over time within Western democracies and so has political polarization and capture in the eyes of
the median voter. The reader interested in how economic concentration transmits into policy
inefficiency and into political distortions is well advised to invest effort in the study of lobbying
and political influence.46 These nonmarket activities appear the main cog in a mechanism
through which such economic differences ossify, perpetuate over time, and further amplify
inefficiencies in public policy.
