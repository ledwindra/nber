The Effect of Daughters on Partisanship

ABSTRACT
Washington (2008) finds that, controlling for total number of children, each additional daughter makes
a member of Congress more likely to vote liberally and attributes this finding to socialization. However,
daughters’ influence could manifest differently for elite politicians and the general citizenry, thanks
to the selection gradient particular to the political process. This study asks whether the proportion
of female biological offspring affects political party identification. Using nationally-representative
data from the General Social Survey, we find that female offspring induce more conservative political
identification. We hypothesize that this results from the change in reproductive fitness strategy that
daughters may evince.

The Effect of Daughters on Partisanship

Introduction
Contact theory suggests that social exposure to individuals of a given group generally
makes us more sympathetic to the culture, tendencies, needs and so on of said group. Support
for this exposure effect on values and beliefs has been found in any number of contexts—such
as neighborhoods and dorm rooms—and across many demographic dimensions—ranging from
race to age (Deutsch and Collins 1951; Wilner et al. 1955; Caspi 1984; Herek and Capitanio
1996; Desforges et al. 1991; Werth and Lord 1992). The family is no exception to this rule: If
we have family members of different groups (race, gender, and so on), we should, ostensibly, be
more favorably disposed toward other individuals in those groups. Likewise, socialization
effects aside, we should expect that individuals’ incentives are at least somewhat aligned with
those in their family. Indeed, on a range of political and social attitudes, within family
correlations are high (Glass et al. 1986; Niemi et al. 1977).
For both of these reasons, we might expect that men and women who spend much of
their lives cohabiting with women—sisters, daughters, and others—should have political views
that are more in line with those of national political women’s organizations as compared to
those who do not. Indeed, several studies before us have found that the more daughters or
sisters an individual has, the more “progressive” his/her views on women’s issues. For
example, some research finds that daughters increase parents’ feminist views (Warner 1991)
and preference for gender equalizing policies – including work, education, and childcare/leave
policies (Warner and Steel 1999). However, this research is limited by the use of a local sample
and a blunt measure of presence or absence of daughters as opposed to a finer scale indicating
the proportion of daughters.

The Effect of Daughters on Partisanship

More recent research by Oswald and Powdthavee (2006) based on the nationally
representative British Household Panel Survey (1991 to 2004) finds that, other things held
constant, each additional daughter increases a parent’s intention to vote liberally (for the Labor
or Liberal Democrat Parties as opposed to the Conservative Party) by about 2 percentage points.
They exclude those intending to vote for smaller parties, such as the Green or Scottish National
Party, and those who are undecided. They argue that daughters make parents subconsciously
more sympathetic to liberal policies. However, the data are limited to children who live at
home, do not include information on those who have left home, and include step-children. Nonbiological children could drive their results since they are not randomly “assigned” so to speak.
The same is true for adult children not covered by the household census since they may
selectively migrate out of the parental home in response to parental gender attitudes.
Washington (2008) estimates the effect of number of daughters on Congressional voting,
controlling for total number of children. She finds that daughters promote liberal voting among
Senators and members of the House of Representatives and attributes this effect to socialization:
Daughters make their parents (mostly their fathers) more sensitive to women’s issues, she
claims. However, the effect of daughters on congressional voting could also result from
selection. Namely, liberal individuals who have daughters might be particularly motivated to
ascend the political ladder as compared to liberal individuals who only have sons. Or, it could
be the case that liberal voters tend to elect politicians who have daughters while conservative
voters are more likely to elect politicians who have sons. Given the extent to which politicians
use their families as “props” to send signals about their views and character, this seems
plausible. On the other hand, among the general citizenry there is no selection gradient to filter
out the less-motivated from the super-motivated in simply expressing their political preferences.

4

The Effect of Daughters on Partisanship

Given stark differences between a highly-selected group of politicians and the general
population, the effect of daughters on political preferences may be very different between the
two groups. (At the very least, there may be heterogeneous treatment effects even if selection is
not at work.) Further, Washington (2008: 7) gleans her data on child gender from the
Congressional Directory or, in case of gender-ambiguous names, from on-line public
biographies or telephone conversations with the member’s office or a newspaper in their
district. She therefore examines the sex of children without distinguishing between adopted,
step, and biological offspring. (Washington [p. 5] explicitly notes that, of the 828 congressional
representatives for whom she has data, 75 experienced a change in number of children from
1997 to 2004 due to birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, or death.) Here selection is an even
more direct problem: While the sex of biological offspring may be random, the sex of adopted
(or even step) children is most certainly not.
Despite existing evidence (and relevant theory) suggesting that additional daughters
should lead to more liberal attitudes, there is reason for pause.1 Conservative policies—antiabortion, pro-traditional family structure and so on—seem to constrain the freedom of women.
So why would parents of daughters want to hem in the life choices of their offspring? In fact,
the rise of women’s rights has been attributed elsewhere to the shift from men’s interests in
constraining their wives in favor of their interests in preventing their daughters from being
exploited as property (Fernandez 2009). However, if one takes an evolutionary perspective on
parental sexual conflict, the opposite predictions ensue. Namely, female and male offspring
1

The evidence does not all go in the direction of additional daughters leading to more liberal views. For instance,
research using national survey data from the National Survey of Families and Households found that sons increase
the egalitarian views of married women with children ages 3 to 18 in the home (Katzev, Warner, and Acock 1994).
However, this study focuses on explaining mothers’ perception of marital instability, with traditional family roles
as a mediator, and it studies the effect of offspring sex on traditional gender roles in the family – such as the
appropriateness of mothers’ employment, marriage, divorce, and cohabitation – rather than opinions about broader
gender roles that are more relevant to political views and policy.

evince divergent reproductive strategies. Since sons can potentially generate high numbers of
grandchildren, they may induce preferences for more libertine social norms and policies—ones
where paternal investment is low and restraints on male fecundity are minimal. Meanwhile,
daughters may elicit grandparental preferences for a world in which male sexuality is
constrained and paternal investment in offspring is greater. In summary, in contrast to previous
research (and Washington [2008] in particular) we hypothesize that daughters may increase
conservatism among general citizens. Indeed, our findings support this hypothesis: controlling
for gender, religion, age, education, and marital status, the proportion of girls significantly
increases Republican Party identification in the United States.

Methods
In a society where antenatal sex-selective abortion is rare, the sex of a particular
biological child is a random variable. This study uses nationally representative data from the
1994 General Social Survey to estimate the effect of the proportion of daughters on political
views. To increase internal validity, the sample excludes individuals without children and
limits analysis to biological children (although results are robust to including non-biological
children). Control variables include gender, religion, age, education, and marital status.2
Findings suggest individual interests, not socialization, explain the effect of girls on political
views. Results hold with no controls, controlling for total number of children, and whether
party identification is measured as a dummy variable or on a scale (called Republican Scale

2

Marital status is a potential confounding factor. Early work by Morgan et al. (1988) found that sons decrease the
likelihood of divorce, conditional on total number of offspring. Research by Lundberg and Rose (2003) and Dahl
and Moretti (2004) also argues that sons reduce the risk of divorce and increase the likelihood that single parents
will marry. Lundberg and Rose (2002, 2004) attribute this to higher leisure time fathers spend with families when
they have a son, and the higher utility received from those marriages by fathers. Marital status is controlled in all
models below but, given endogeneity concerns, results are similar when excluding it.

below) from strong Democrat (-3) to strong Republican (3) with Independents in the middle (0).

Results
The association between daughters and political identification is illustrated in Figure 1.
It shows the proportion identifying as Republican or Democrat by proportion of female children
for a two-child, three-child, and four-child family. Table 1 shows results for linear probability
models predicting party identification. Having a higher proportion of daughters consistently
and significantly increases the probability of Republican Party identification and reduces the
likelihood of Democratic identification. Compared to those with no daughters, parents with all
daughters are 14% less likely to identify as a Democrat. This holds with or without controls for
gender, religion, age, education, and marital status. Similarly, parents with all daughters are
10% more likely to identify as a Republican compared to those with no daughters (11% without
controls in the model).
Specifying Republican identification as a continuous measure gives similar results.
Republican identification for those with all daughters is half a point higher than those with
none. This would push borderline independents to be Republicans. Daughters significantly
strengthen conservative identification. This relationship holds when controlling for total
number of children or using an alternative specification of no or all daughters. Meanwhile,
deploying Washington’s method – that is, estimating the effect of number of daughters while
controlling for total children – yields the same results, although the effects are smaller and total
number of children has a significant independent effect (in the opposite direction of number of
daughters). Results are also consistent when including non-biological children. In summary,
regardless of model specification, daughters consistently increase conservative party

identification in the United States.

Discussion
Results contradict both Washington (2008) and Oswald and Powdthavee (2006). If
daughters affect political views by socializing parents, the effect of daughters should be similar
for both politicians and general citizens. On the other hand, if daughters affect parents’ political
views by changing their individual interests, daughters may increase conservatism among the
general population but serve as a selection gradient among successful liberal politicians (and
vice versa for conservative politicians). We find support for the latter interpretation and, by
extension, for evolutionary theories of inclusive fitness.
If individuals seek to maximize their chances of passing on genes to future generations
(“inclusive fitness”), they may desire more conservative policies when they have more female
genetic kin. There is an inherent conflict between parents that is particularly acute in species
that invest heavily in offspring (so-called K-strategy organisms). Males’ optimal reproductive
strategy is to sire many offspring with a range of mates and push the parenting requirements
onto the mothers. Meanwhile, the mother seeks to maximize not only the genetic fitness of the
sire, but also to induce more post-conception investment in rearing the offspring from the father.
Seen in this light, more conservative policies that increase the cost of promiscuity—particularly
for males—will enhance the reproductive bargaining power of women. If individual interests
lie in genetic endurance, those with more daughters should hold more conservative political
views. The conservative emphasis on family, traditional values and gender roles, and prolife/anti-abortion sentiments all stress investment in children – for both men and women.
Conservative policies mirror the genetic interests of women, writ large. They attempt to

8

promote paternal investment in offspring. Further, they stress investment in conceived
offspring – “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” In short, Conservative policies
support the genetic fitness of women by capitalizing on each pregnancy, reducing male
promiscuity, and increasing paternal investment in children. Such policies may impinge on the
freedom of parents’ immediate offspring, but they increase the expected number of
grandchildren via daughters.

All models are un-weighted, limited to those with biological children, and the proportion of
female children excludes non-biological children. There is no significant interaction between
gender and proportion girls.
Results are the same when using Washington’s methods – including number of girls and
controlling for total number of children as opposed to using proportion girls. However, the
magnitude is smaller; the coefficient on number of girls is about half that of proportion girls in
each model. Number of biological children is significantly associated with Democratic
identification and may be endogenous.
