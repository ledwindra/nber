Financing Consumption in an Aging Japan: The Roles of Foreign Capital Inflows and
Immigration
Robert Dekle
NBER Working Paper No. 10781
September 2004
JEL No. F2, F3, F4

ABSTRACT
We project the impact of demographic change on Japanese capital flows by simulating the impact
of population aging on Japanese saving and investment rates. As aging depresses saving rates, in our
baseline projections, we show that by 2015, foreign capital inflows will comprise about 15 percent
of Japanese output. A distinguishing feature of this paper is that we compare the capital flows that
occur without immigration to the capital inflows that would occur with immigration of 400,000
people annually. With the larger labor force from immigration and the larger induced capital
accumulation, output will be 22 percent higher by 2020, and 50 percent higher by 2040. The higher
output means that less capital needs to be imported; by 2015, Japan will be importing only 8 percent
of its output.

1. Introduction.
Over the next several decades, Japan’s population will be aging rapidly. In 1955, only
5.5 percent of the population was 65 years or older; by 1998, 16.2 percent were elderly.
Projections imply large increases in the elderly in the next 20 years; by 2015, 25 percent of the
population will be 65 or above. Declining fertility is the principal source of the changing
demographic patterns (Takayama, 1998). In the years following the Second World War, the
total fertility rate in Japan rose to about 4 by 1950. However, fertility declined sharply during
the 1970s and 1980s. It was 2.1 per household in 1974, but 1.4 per household by 1997. The
total fertility rate is expected to remain at about 1.4 over the next several decades.1 Moreover,
Japan has typically allowed only a small number of immigrants, who, especially in Englishspeaking countries, have helped to keep the population young.
A key question is how consumption in an aging population can be sustained. The
elderly consume, but do not supply the labor that leads to higher output. Thus, as the
population ages, the share of consumption in output increases. If domestic output is
insufficient to sustain consumption in an aging population, capital must be imported. In this
paper, we revisit the impact of demographic change on Japanese capital outflows and inflows.
We show that the aging population will decrease both saving and investment rates, but the
decline in saving rates will be more severe, leading to current account deficits and foreign
capital inflows. In our baseline projections, we show that by 2015, foreign capital inflows will
comprise about 15 percent of output.
We project the impact of demographic change on Japanese capital flows by simulating

Japan: 2001-2050,” which is based on the 2000 population census.

3
the impact of aging on Japanese saving and investment rates. In our simulations, we adopt the
standard small-country, open capital markets, Ramsey optimal growth model. Specifically, we
follow Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers’ (1990) modifications to the Ramsey growth
model, in examining the impact of changing demographics on saving and investment. Our
main innovation is that while Cutler et. al.’s work focused on the closed-economy, we focus on
the open-economy, so that capital inflows into Japan can be explicitly modeled.
Past work projecting the impact of demographic change on Japan’s saving-investment
balance are voluminous; see for example Horioka (1991, 1992), Oishi and Yashiro (1997),
Auerbach et. al. (1989), Miles and Cerney (2001), McKibbin and Nguyen (2001) and many
others. The distinguishing feature of our work is that in our projections, we compare the
capital flows that will occur without immigration, to the inflows that occur with immigration.
Consistent with the United Nation’s recommendations, we assume that from 2005 to 2040,
Japan will allow 400,000 immigrants annually. With the larger labor force from immigration
and the larger induced capital accumulation, output in 2000 will be 22 percent higher by 2020,
and 50 percent higher by 2040. The higher output means that less capital needs to be imported.
In our projections with immigration, by 2015, Japan will be importing only about 8 percent of
its output. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first paper to simulate the effect of
increased immigration into Japan, on that country’s saving-investment balances.
The benefits of immigration into Japan are a hotly debated topic. While in recent
centuries, Japan has virtually allowed no immigrants, immigration has been massive in some
previous centuries. Some anthropologists believe that the import of wet-rice cultivation, and of
iron and bronze tools and implements from China and Korea during the Yayoi period (400

4
B.C. to 300 A.D.) were accompanied by massive or at least modest immigration from those
two countries (Seki, 2000). Japan’s population at the beginning of the Yayoi period was
estimated to be between 75 and 250 thousand; the population grew 70-fold during the Yayoi
period. Some anthropologists also believe that during the Kofun period (300 A.D. to 700
A.D.), Korean, but not Chinese, immigration was extensive (Diamond, 1998). These Korean
immigrants brought Buddhism, writing, horseback riding, and new ceramic and metallurgical
techniques.
Our simulation model also requires that we project government finances. We show that
the aging of the population will worsen government finances, as healthcare and social security
spending soar. In our baseline simulations, we show that Japanese taxes would need to increase
from 28 percent of GDP to almost 50 percent of GDP by 2040 to cover the current Japanese
government net debt, and the future government spending. With immigration, social security
and healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP will be lower, meaning that future tax
increases can be lower. We show that with immigration, the Japanese tax-GDP ratio would
need to increase to only 45 percent by 2040.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the demographic
changes undergoing in Japan, and present the Japanese government’s demographic projections.
We then show how Japan’s future demographic profile would improve when 400,000 annual
immigrants are allowed. In Sections 3 and 4, we digress briefly to describe the institutional
characteristics of the Japanese social security system. We show that in practice, the Japanese
social security accounts are inextricably intertwined with the general budget of the Japanese
government; and that it is difficult to separate the Japanese social security accounts from the

5
general government budget. This justifies the assumption in our model that there are no
dedicated social security payroll taxes; and that all taxation can be summarized by a lump-sum
distortionary tax. In Section 5, we simulate the impact of demographic change on future
Japanese saving and investment rates, government deficits, and net capital inflows, both
without and with immigration. Section 6 concludes.

2. Aging, Immigration, and Support Ratios.
Figure 1 plots the Japanese government’s projections of the country’s population and
the percentage of the total population that is elderly.2 Japan’s population is expected to decline
from the 2000 peak of 124 million to 122 million by 2010, and then gradually decline to about
100 million by about 2050. The labor force (age 20-64) is projected to fall from 75 million in
2000 to 50 million in 2050.
The percentage of the population over the age of 65 has grown rapidly, especially since
1980, and now stands at about 15 per cent. By 2020, that percentage should approach 28
percent, and by 2050, 33 per cent. These rates of population aging are much higher than in
other countries. For example, in the U.S., only about 15 per cent of the population will be
above the age of 65 by 2025.

Immigration into Japan.

2

The figures for 1955-99 were calculated from data presented in Japan’s Statistical
Yearbook. The figures from 2000-2050 were calculated from the medium projections of the
population by age group presented in the Ministry of Health and Welfare (2002).

6
Between 1970 and the mid-1980s, Japan annually allowed between 20 and 30 thousand
immigrants.3 During the late 1980s and early 1990s, because of the severe shortage of labor,
annual immigration increased to about 70 to 90 thousand, but that number declined in recent
years. In terms of stocks, Japan’s immigrant population numbered 1.5 million, or 1.2 percent of
the population, with perhaps another 500 thousand in illegal immigrants in 1997. This is
contrasted with the United States, which in the same year, had a stock of 26 million legal
immigrants, or 9.7 percent of the population. Annual flows of legal immigrants to the U.S. is
about 1 million (0.4 percent of the population), with an additional estimated illegal immigrant
flow of 1 million.
The United Nations Population Division (1998) projects that to keep the size of the
Japanese population constant at today’s level of 125 million, Japan would need an average of
400,000 immigrants per year between 2005 and 2050. In our projections of the Japanese
population structure with immigration, we assume that 200 thousand men and 200 thousand
women immigrate annually. They are assumed to be equally divided between the age groups of
20-24 and 25-29. We also assume that all 20-24 year old immigrant couples have 2 children
each within 5 years of their arrival in Japan.
Under these assumptions, Figure 2 depicts the total population and the population over
age 65, with immigration. With immigration, the population peaks at 2015 at 135 million and
stays at about that level.4 The labor force is kept robust with immigration. The labor force is
projected to fall from 79 million to about 74 million in 2050.
3

The data on immigration are from Papademetriou and Hamilton (2001)

4

Our population projections are somewhat higher than the United Nations projections,
because we assume higher immigrant fertility rates.

7
By 2050, the immigrants and their decedents will comprise about 18 percent of the total
population of the country. As immigrants reach age 65 after 2040, the elderly population
increases somewhat. The proportion of those over the age of 65 reaches 25 percent in 2020, and
29 percent in 2050. Thus, even with this immigration, the population of Japan will be
considerably older than in the United States.

The Support Ratio.
Demographic shifts affect the economy’s consumption opportunities because they
change the relative sizes of the self-supporting and dependent populations. Following Cutler,
Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers (1990), we summarize these changes by the support ratio,
denoted by

α , which we define as the effective labor force, LF, divided by the number of

consumers, CON,

α = LF / CON .
The first issue in measuring the support ratio concerns the relative consumption needs of
people at different ages. We assume that all people have identical resource needs so that:

CON =

99

∑N
i =1

i,

where N i is the number of people of age i.
The second issue concerns the effective labor force. We assume simply that all people

8
aged 20-64 are in the labor force, while individuals 19 and under or 65 and over are not5:
64

LF =

∑N.

i = 20

i

This measure is used by the Japanese government in projecting the future labor force.
Figure 3 plots the support ratios without (LF) and with immigration (LFIM).6 As the
population falls, the support ratio declines under both scenarios, but the decline in the support
ratio is steeper without immigration. Without immigration, the support ratio falls from 1.0 in
2000 to 0.86 in 2025 and 0.80 in 2050. With immigration, the support ratio falls from 1.0 in
2000 to 0.89 in 2025 and 0.86 in 2050.

3. Aging and the Japanese Social Security System.
The Japanese social security system is two-tiered. The first-tier is the universal pension,
which provides a flat basic pension, currently averaging about 50 thousand yen. Enrollment is
mandatory for all Japanese residents, including immigrants, between the ages of 20 and 60. An

5

This is obviously a heroic assumption. The labor force participation rate of 20-24 year
olds is about 75 percent, because of continued attendance in college. Also, a significant fraction
of women between the ages of 25 and 64 (about 30 percent) are not in the labor force. In an
earlier paper, (Dekle, 2000), I calculated a labor force measure that recognizes that both human
capital and labor force participation rates vary by age and gender. I compared the support ratios
using the two labor force measures, and found that the support ratios have very similar patterns,
especially after 1995 (Dekle 2000; Figure 3). Given the similarity of the two support ratios, we
focus on the simpler support ratio above.
6

As the referee correctly points out, the quality of the immigrants may be low. Given the
lower quality of immigrants, more immigrants may be necessary. On the other hand, we have
shown above that differences in human capital do not significantly affect patterns in the support
ratio. Since in our model, the effect of demographics is entirely summarized by the support ratio,
the lower human capital of immigrants may not greatly impact our simulation values.

9
interesting feature of the universal pension plan is that 1/3 (½ by 2004) of the benefits are paid
from the general budget of the government. The second-tier covers most employees, and
contributions are wage related. Presently, contributions are 13.6 percent of annual income,
shared equally between employee and employer. Average monthly benefits are about 180,000
yen. The Japanese social security system has built up a sizable trust fund–about 30 percent of
GDP–but is essentially a “pay-as-you-go” system.

Problems with the Japanese Social Security System.
Intergenerational Inequality.
One characteristic of pay-as-you-go social security systems is that when the population
ages, the elderly receive more from the system than they pay into the system. In turn, younger
generations pay more into the system than they receive from the system. The main reason why
pay-as-you-go social security leads to intergenerational inequality is that when population
growth rates decline, taxes must increase or benefits must decline to keep social security intakes
approximately equal to payouts. Thus, in the face of an aging population, the Japanese
government has repeatedly raised payroll taxes and cut social security payout ratios in an
attempt to keep the future system intact.7
These policy changes have hurt future generations. Takayama and Kitamura (1999)
identified large intergenerational imbalances in Japan, with future generations expected to pay
about 3-4 times more in net taxes and social security contributions than the generation currently
in retirement. Hatta and Oguchi (1999, p. 5) calculate that people born in 1935 receive about
7

For example, social security payroll taxes as a percentage of income was 3 percent in
1979, and 17.4 percent in 2002. It is projected to be 26.2 percent of income in 2035.

10
3.8 times what they paid; and people born in 2010 receive only about 60 percent of what they
paid.

Unfunded Social Security Liabilities.
Another consequence of slowing population growth under pay-as-you-go social security
is the accumulation of unfunded government liabilities. Although the government has in recent
years--especially in 1999-- raised payroll taxes and reduced future benefits, unfunded liabilities
have continued to accumulate. The government bases its future projections of the social security
balance on assumptions regarding future demographics, income growth, and interest rates.
Based on these assumptions, the government determines its projected payroll taxes and benefits;
so as to keep the annual flows of social security intakes and payouts approximately equal.
However, some analysts have argued that the government’s assumptions are over-optimistic,
and that the projected payroll taxes and benefits will lead to annual deficits (Nishizawa, 2003;
Chand and Jaeger, 1996).
The present value of these annual deficits do not appear on the government’s balance
sheets, and are called unfunded social security liabilities. Chand and Jaeger (1996) estimate the
present (2000) value of Japan’s unfunded social security liabilities as 110 percent of GDP.
Hatta and Oguchi (1999) estimate the present value of unfunded liabilities as 140 percent of
GDP. On an optimistic note, the IMF estimates that the 1999 government pension reforms have
reduced government unfunded social security liabilities to about 30 percent of GDP (IMF,
2000).
There are several reasons for the continued accumulation of unfunded liabilities.

11
First, the government’s demographic projections have consistently underestimated the pace of
future population aging; because of rapidly declining fertility rates, and lengthening life-spans.
The total fertility rate has declined from 2.1 per household in 1975 to 1.33 per household in
2001. Meanwhile, male life expectancies have increased from 72 in 1975 to 78 in 2001. Since
demographic projections are based on current fertility rates and life-spans, adverse movements
in these variables make demographic projections over-optimistic. Based on these demographic
projections, tax rates have turned out to be too low, and benefits, too high, resulting in large
unfunded liabilities.
Second, is government’s inability to get a good interest rate on the social security trust
fund. The government’s projections assume a 4.5 percent interest rate on the social security
trust fund. Since there were relatively few aged until now, the social security system ran
persistent surpluses, and the trust fund reached 150 trillion yen (30 percent of GDP) by end2002. Until 2001, these funds were by law invested in government investment projects through
the fiscal investment and loan program; and earned the interest rate on government bonds,
which recently yielded about 0.7 percent. Since 2001, the social security trust fund has been
allowed to invest in financial markets, although asset allocations have been legally prescribed.8
Given the weakness of Japanese financial markets, the fund earned a minus 2.5 percent in 2001.
It appears unlikely that the government will be able to earn rates of return approaching 4.5
percent, which means less income from the social security trust fund; and larger unfunded
liabilities.
Finally, there has recently been a sharp increase in non-payments of social security
8

The prescribed asset allocations are 68 percent domestic bonds; 12 percent domestic
stocks; 7 percent foreign bonds; 8 percent foreign stocks; and 5 percent domestic deposits.

12
payroll taxes and other social security contributions. As in other countries, participation in the
social security system in Japan is mandatory.9 However, Nishizawa (2003, p. 63) calculates that
nearly 40 percent of those required to participate in the social security system fail to pay taxes
or contributions. These non-payers include the unemployed, the self-employed refusing to pay
contributions, and those with incomes so low that they are excused from paying contributions.
The existence of these non-payers results in a increase in unfunded liabilities.

Recently Enacted or Proposed Social Security Reform Measures.
Recent social security reform measures have focused on reducing the intergenerational
inequality, and unfunded social security liabilities. In 1999, the Japanese government enacted
their latest social security reform measures. These reforms: 1) cut the future level of benefits
across the board by 5 percent in real terms ; 2) scheduled a gradual increase in the age of
eligibility of social security benefits from 60 today to 61 in 2013 and 65 by 2030; and 3)
eliminated the automatic indexing of social security benefits to increases in the real wage.
Japanese authorities have claimed that without these reforms, payroll taxes would need to
increase to 35 percent by 2025; but with the reforms, payroll taxes would need to increase to
only 28 percent.
Many private sector analysts have argued that these measures do not fundamentally
resolve the problems of the social security system. As pointed out above, the government’s
demographic assumptions appear over-optimistic; with more realistic assumptions, payroll taxes

9

However, not everyone paying contributions is eligible to receive social security
benefits. Current law says that if the total payment period is less than 25 years, the participant is
not eligible to receive full benefits

13
will have to increase substantially, leading to greater intergenerational inequality, and larger
unfunded social security liabilities. Overwhelmingly, private sector analysts recommend a shift
from the current pay-as-you-go system to a fully-funded system.
Hatta and Oguchi (1999) are perhaps the strongest proponents of this shift to a fullyfunded system. In shifting from the current pay-as-you-go system to the fully-funded system,
they recommend the following process. They first recommend that the government fully fund
the amount of unfunded social security liabilities by issuing bonds. Their reasoning is that the
funding of these liabilities are not just the responsibility of future wage earners, but also the
responsibility of all citizens. In fact, they recommend that these bonds be covered by increased
consumption taxes, which would be levied on the elderly as well. Next they recommend that the
benefits of future retirees be cut by 20 percent; and that future payroll taxes be lowered to make
the system actuarily fair. The portion of the benefits of the current retirees that should have
been paid by payroll taxes on the currently working are thus unfunded and should be covered by
increased consumption taxes.

4. Social Security and Overall Government Spending in Our Model.
Our approach differs from the traditional approach in modeling the Japanese social
security system. First, unlike in Hatta and Oguchi (1999), Nishizawa (2003), Japanese Ministry
of Welfare and Labor (2001) and others, we do not estimate the amount of unfunded social
security liabilities. To do so would require separately projecting social security benefits, and in
particular, dedicated social security payroll taxes. Thus, in our model, we do not differentiate
between dedicated social security payroll taxes and other forms of taxation. Our view is that in

14
practice, Japanese social security accounts cannot be separated from the overall Japanese
government budget.
Some of the social security benefits, and much of the excess social security payroll taxes
(i.e., social security trust fund) are today inextricably intertwined with the general government
budget. As noted, as much as 50 percent of the benefits of the basic pension will be (from 2004)
subsidized from the general government budget. In addition, most analysts expect that as
unfunded liabilities mount, this rate of subsidy will increase. For example, as mentioned, Hatta
and Oguchi (1999) recommend that all of the currently projected unfunded social security
liabilities should be paid for by the general government budget (consumption taxes).
Moreover, part of the social security trust fund (about 80 percent) is mixed in with other
government borrowing-- like postal saving deposits--to finance the massive Fiscal Investment
and Loan Program. Hoshi and Doi (2003) estimate that over 50 percent of government funds in
FILP are irrecoverable, which means that some of the social security trust fund is irrecoverable.
Money to replace these irrecoverable loans must come from the general government budget.
Second, unlike in Hatta and Oguchi (1999) and Takayama and Kitamura (1999), we will
not be concerned with the redistributive effects of the social security system, and the
intergenerational inequality that arises from the system. In our model, we assume that Japanese
households are Ricardian. If the elderly raise their bequests to completely offset the costs to the
young of the higher burden of social security, then the higher burden of social security has no
redistributive effects.
Our model only requires that we project overall government spending patterns by age
group. In our projections, we focus on the three largest social expenditures: social security,

15
healthcare, and education. For social security, we divide average social security expenditures in
1996-99 by the population over age 60. For healthcare, we allocate average healthcare spending
in 1996-99 to different ages, using the age-specific expenditure patterns reported in Ishi (2000).
For education, we divide total education spending in 2000 by the population between the ages 5
and 20.
For healthcare and education, we assume that age-specific expenditure patterns remain
at the same real level between 2000 and 2040. For social security, we assume that the age of
eligibility gradually increases from 60 to 65 in 2030, but once eligible, the age-specific benefits
remain the same as today in real terms (in accordance with the 1999 reform). That is, if the
average 67 year old receives 180 thousand yen in social security benefits in 2000, an average 67
year old receives the same inflation adjusted amount in 2035. Other government spending,
mainly defense, policing, and administration, are assumed to always equal the average 1996-99
ratio to GDP of 5.6 percent.
Demographic shifts can significantly alter the patterns and overall levels of government
spending. Tables 1 and 2 depict the projections of total government spending in 1995 yen and as
a share of projected GDP without and with immigration. Without immigration (Table 1),
government spending rises from 25 percent of GDP in 2000 to 28 percent in 2015, and 33
percent in 2035. While education spending is projected to decline, healthcare, and especially
social security spending, are projected to increase sharply, as the population ages. In particular,
in 2035, the population over 65 increases significantly, leading to sharp increases in social
security and healthcare spending.
With 400,000 annual immigrants (Table 2), government spending rises from 25 percent

16
of GDP in 2000 to 27 percent in 2015, but falls thereafter to 22 percent in 2040. Government
spending as a proportion of GDP falls, because while immigration raises the level of
government spending somewhat, immigration sharply boosts the level of Japanese GDP,
resulting in a fall in the ratio of government spending to GDP. The immigration-induced
increase in the labor force and in capital accumulation raises the projected Japanese annual real
GDP growth rate between 2000 and 2040 from 0 percent without immigration to 1.1 percent
with immigration. These growth rates mean that output in 2020 will be 22 percent higher by
2020, and 50 percent higher by 2040 with immigration.
With immigration, the absolute levels of health care and education spending increase, as
immigrants also require healthcare and especially, education services for their children. The
absolute level of social security spending increases after 2035 as some of the immigrants start to
retire.

5. Demographic Change, Government Deficits, and Optimal Capital Flows.
Here we simulate the impact of aging and of immigration on future Japanese saving and
investment rates, and government spending and deficits. In our simulations, we adopt the
standard small-country, open capital markets, Ramsey optimal-growth model (Barro and Sali-iMartin, 1995, Ch. 3). Specifically, we closely follow Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers’
(1990) modifications to the Ramsey model, in examining the impact of changing demographics
on savings and government deficits.10 With the model, we can examine how a society can
10

The Ramsey model assumes that households are dynastic–they care about their
children’s and grandchildren’s welfare (utility) as much as their own. Of course, an important
implication of dynastic households is that Ricardian equivalence holds; government debt does
not affect the intergenerational distribution of wealth.

17
adjust its saving, investment, capital inflows, and government deficits, in response to changes in
demographic variables, summarized by the support ratio.

(i). Behavior of Firms.
We begin with the production function of a representative firm that uses both private
and public capital as inputs:

$ t γ α 1− λ e ht
y t = k$ t γ m

(1)

where y t is gross output per population (capita), k$ t is the private capital stock per effective

$ t is the public capital stock per effective population, and
population, m

h is the constant rate of

labor augmenting technical progress. We assume constant returns to scale in private and public
capital, so that (1 − λ ) = 2γ . In the above production function, public capital is essential for the
productivity of private capital–ie., public capital is not wasteful. This goes against conventional
wisdom regarding the wastefulness of recent public investment in Japan. In our production
function, we are mostly concerned with the productivity of public capital over the long run
(over decades), and public investment was certainly productive in Japan in the past (1960s and

There is a large literature testing whether the dynastic model is applicable for Japan(for a
review, see Horioka, 2001). The dynastic model can be contrasted with the life-cycle model, in
which households do not care about their children. Thus, in the life-cycle model, households
bring down their wealth (dissave) in old age. On the whole, the empirical tests support the
dynastic model, and reject the life-cycle model. The Japanese elderly, on average, leave large
bequests to their children, and this appears to be motivated by altruism towards the next
generation.

‘70s), and may be productive again in the future.11

$ t and the support ratios are constant, output per capita also grows
Note that when k$ t , m
at a constant rate h. When the support ratio is falling, however, output per capita grows at a
slower rate than h.
The supply of private capital available to the firm depends on the global capital market;
the marginal product of capital must equal r +
rates, and

δ , where r is the gross international real interest

δ is the rate of depreciation. We have:
v

$ 1t − v ,
k$ t = ( r + δ )(avα 1t − λ ) −1 m

(2)

and thus private investment per capita is:

&
i$t = k$t + (nt + h + δ ) k$t .

(3)

where n t is the population growth rate Thus, the paths of private capital and private investment
are solely determined by the real interest rate, the rates of growth of the labor force and
population, technical progress, and the path of public capital.
The government adjusts the level of public capital by changing the public investment
rate, $jt :

11

It is difficult to predict the future efficiency of public investment. Japan, however, lags
behind the U.S. in public research and development ( R & D), including R & D in universities.
Branstetter and Nakamura (2003) argue that greater public R & D spending can boost Japanese
growth. Thus, future government public capital, especially R & D that is embedded in public
capital, may be productive.

(ii) Behavior of Consumers.
The consumption rate is determined from “forward-looking” household behavior.
Assume that households wish to maximize their lifetime utility, U, given by12:

where c is consumption per capita, 1 / θ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, and

ρ is

the pure rate of time preference.
The budget constraint for households (in per-capita terms) is:

qτ t2
a&t = α t wt + (r − nt )at − τ t −

where

at is total assets per capita, which is comprised of private capital, government bonds,

In an insightful paper, Barro (1974) showed that Ricardian equivalence can prevail in
the overlapping generations model with bequests, even though each individual is mortal. Even
though each individual cares directly only about his immediate descendant, this is enough to link
him to all future generations. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002, p. 175-177) presents the exact
conditions that are required to collapse the overlapping generations model to the single
representative agent model, as in our paper. Thus, the infinite-horizon utility function, (5) is
consistent with our earlier definition of the support ratio, in which agents die when they reach
100 years.

and foreign assets, which are perfect substitutes in international portfolios; w t are wages; and

τ t is the lump-sum tax imposed on each person each period by the government.
qτ t2
tax also imposes a “deadweight” welfare loss of
2

This lump-sum

per person.

It can be shown (see Appendix) that consumption per capita also always grows at h.
Thus, while consumption per capita grows at h, when the support ratio is declining, output per
capita tends to grow at less than h (see ii). The consumption rate,

ct
is rising, lowering the
yt

private saving rate.

(iii) The Government Budget Constraint and Government Behavior.
Each period, the government issues government bonds of,

b&

to cover shortfalls in tax

revenues:

b&t = (r − nt )bt − τ t + gt + jt
where

bt is government bonds outstanding per capita.

(7)

The increase in government bonds per

capita is higher, the larger is the primary fiscal deficit, which is the difference between tax
revenues per capita, and the sum of government consumption gt and public investment

jt per

21
capita. As in Cutler, et. al. (1990), we assume that gt is determined by age-specific patterns of
government consumption, as presented in Tables 1 (without immigration) and 2 (with
immigration).13
It can be shown (see Appendix) that the government will choose to levy a per capita
lump-sum tax of τ t that grows at the rate of consumption per capita growth, h. The government
must then satisfy the following intertemporal budget constraint:
∞

∞

τ 0 ∫ e R t dt = b 0 + ∫ (g t + jt ) R t dt
ht

0

where

(8)

0

b0 is the government debt outstanding per person today, and Rt is a discount factor.

This

budget constraint says that the present value of tax revenues must equal the present value of
government consumption plus public investment. If government tax revenues are insufficient to
cover government spending today, then in the future, tax revenues must exceed government
spending for the government to satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint.
As in Clarida (1993), we assume that the government maximizes lifetime household
utility (5), with respect to ct and $jt subject to the constraints. We simulate the model using
plausible parameter values, projected future support ratios without immigration, LF, and with
immigration, LFIM, and future rates of population and labor force growth without and with

13

We also assume that gt either yields no utility to households, or that government
benefits do not affect the household’s optimal choice of private consumption.

22
immigration.
In the simulations, we allow support ratios and rates of population and labor force
growth to change every five years. Details of the simulation are given in the Appendix. For
comparability with actual National Accounts Data, we express our simulations in terms of ratios
to GDP. We calibrate our model so that the starting year (2000) corresponds to the average of
the actual data between 1996-99. For the initial government debt-GDP ratio, we use the ratio of
net debt-GDP, inclusive of the social security net assets (=45 percent of GDP). We account for
net future social security unfunded liabilities by explicitly incorporating future social security
benefits and contributions into our model.

(iv) Projections of Optimal Government Deficits and Capital Flows: Without
Immigration.
Table 3 presents our projections without immigration. Private saving rates decline about
10 percentage points until 2010, and then decline rapidly from 2010 to 2040. This pattern is a
result of shifts in the support ratio and increases in tax rates, which reduce disposable income.
Although consumption per capita always grows at a constant rate of h (=1.2 percent), as the
support ratio falls, output per capita growth is lower. This raises the consumption rate and
lowers the private saving rate. Essentially, consumers are seeking to smooth their consumption
when income is growing very slowly by lowering their saving rates.
Under tax smoothing, taxes per capita increase at a constant rate, while output per capita
grows at a slower rate; thus the tax-GDP ratio rises over time. However, the actual tax rate in
the starting year (average, 1996-99) at 28 percent of GDP, is lower than what is necessitated by

23
tax smoothing (33 percent) and the satisfaction of the government’s intertemporal budget
constraint. That is, unless current tax rates are increased, the government will not be able to
satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint. We allow taxes per capita to increase more rapidly
between 2000 to 2015, and then smooth increases in taxes per capita from 2015 onwards. The
sharp increases in tax rates between 2000 and 2015 also contributes to the decline in private
saving rates, by lowering disposable income. By 2040, tax rates need to increase to almost 50
percent of GDP, for the government to recoup its current outstanding net debt of 45 percent of
GDP, and to cover its increased future spending.
Government saving rates rise from about 1-2 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 11
percent in 2040, owing to increased tax receipts. Private and public investment rates gradually
fall over time, as the need to equip workers with capital equipment declines. Because of high
government saving and falling public investment, the fiscal surplus (government saving minus
public investment) turns positive after 2020. Consequently, the government net debt-GDP ratio
increases until 2020, and falls thereafter.
The decrease in private saving is sharper than the increase in government saving,
resulting in a fall in total saving between 2000 and 2040. The total saving rate declines from
about 30 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2015, and then rises to 15 percent in 2040, as the
government saving rate rises. The total investment rate declines from 28 percent in 2000 to 25
percent in 2015, 23 percent in 2030, and 22 percent in 2040. Thus, the decline in total saving is
sharper than the decline in total investment, leading to larger current account deficits. Japan’s
current account surplus is projected to become negative in 2005, and sharply negative from then
onwards. Part of Japan’s domestic consumption will be financed from international capital

24
inflows from about 2005. By 2015, foreign capital inflows are projected to be 15 percent of
Japan’s GDP. This ratio declines to about 8 percent by 2040, as government saving increases..

(v) Projections of Optimal Government Deficits and Capital Flows: With Immigration.
Table 4 presents our projections with immigration of 400,000 people a year. Private
saving rates decline about 8 percentage points until 2010. The decline in private saving between
2010 and 2040, however, is milder with immigration than without, owing to improvements in
the support ratio, especially after 2015. By 2040, private saving rates decline to about 7 percent
of GDP.
With immigration, the growth in GDP is higher, and projected government spending as a
percentage of GDP is smaller, meaning that tax rates can be lower. However, even with lower
tax rates, the actual tax rate in the starting year (average, 1996-99) at 28 percent of GDP, is
below what is necessitated by tax smoothing (33 percent), and the satisfaction of the
government’s intertemporal budget constraint. Thus, again, we allow taxes per capita to
increase more rapidly between 2000 to 2015, and then smooth increases in taxes per capita from
2015 onwards. By 2040, tax rates need to increase to only 45 percent of GDP-- instead of
almost 50 percent without immigration--for the government to satisfy its intertemporal budget
constraint.
Government saving rates rise from about 1-2 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 12
percent in 2040, owing to increased tax receipts. Private and public investment rates gradually
fall over time, but the decline is less rapid with immigration, as the labor force stays roughly
constant from 2005. The government net debt-GDP ratio increases until 2020-25, and falls

25
rapidly thereafter.
The decrease in the private saving rate is larger than the increase in the government
saving rate, resulting in a fall in the total saving rate between 2000 and 2040. The total saving
rate declines from about 30 percent in 2000 to 16 percent in 2020, but bounces back to 19
percent by 2040, as government saving rises. Total investment declines from 28 percent in 2000
to 24 percent in 2030-40. The current account deficit, while worsening to 10 percent of GDP in
2020, improves to a deficit of only 5 percent of GDP by 2040, as the government saving rate
increases.

6. Conclusion.
Many previous papers (Horioka (1991, 1992), Oishi and Yashiro (1997), Auerbach et.
al. (1989), Miles and Cerney (2001), McKibbin and Nguyen (2001) and others) have projected
the impact of demographic change on the Japanese saving-investment balance and on capital
inflows, although papers projecting future Japanese government budget balances are fewer.
Despite the variety of methodologies and modeling assumptions, most earlier papers–like our
paper–project declining saving and investment rates, with saving rates declining faster than
investment rates, leading to current account deficits and capital inflows. On the whole, the
previous papers predict deteriorating government budget balances, unless there is drastic fiscal
reform. The proposed fiscal reforms in the previous papers range from tax increases to cuts in
social security benefits and public investment. In our paper, we have focused on tax increases.
A unique feature of our work is that we also examine scenarios in which the government
allows sizable immigration (400,000 immigrants per year from 2005 to 2040) into Japan. We

26
show that with immigration, Japan’s projected capital inflows as a percentage of GDP will be
much smaller, since the higher labor force will be able to raise Japan’s GDP, to help sustain its
growing elderly population. With the larger labor force from immigration, Japanese output in
2020 will be 22 percent higher by 2020, and 50 percent higher by 2040. Finally, with
immigration, social security and healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP will be lower,
meaning that future tax increases can be smaller.

27
Appendix:
For convenience, we carry out the analysis in terms of effective population. The data for
the population, n t and the labor force, z t (and therefore, α t ) are available only every 5 years.
Thus, we assume that n t and z t discretely change only every five years; within any 5-year
interval, say 2005 to 2010, n t and z t are assumed to be constant. From 2050 onwards, we
assume that the values for 2050 hold.
From (1), real wages per effective population are:

w$ t = (1 − γ ) y$ t
In addition, we assume that there are adjustment costs to adjusting public capital,
reflecting political lobbying costs, and bureaucratic implementation lags,
χ $j
adj cos ts = $jt (1 + ( t )) ,
$t
2 m

(A1)

where χ reflects the costs of adjustment.
The government (or optimal planner) maximizes (5), in terms of effective population,
with respect to (4), (6), (7), (8), and (A1).

Optimal Consumption.
The optimal path of consumption per effective population is:

c&$ 1
= *( r − ρ − θ g) .
c$ θ

28
To prevent consumption per effective labor from approaching zero asymptotically, we
assume that r = ρ + θ g , so that consumption per effective population is flat, or that
consumption per capita grows at rate h. For h, we take, 0.012 (from Jorgenson and Nishimizu,
1978). Consumption per effective population at time 0, c$ (0) , (in our case, the year 2000),
depends in a complicated way on the parameters of the lifetime utility function, and the entire
future paths of n t , α t , τ$ t , g$ t , $jt , w
$ t , the parameters r, h, and the starting values, a$ 0 ,and b$ 0 .
Rather than calculating c$ (0) , we assume that the actual level of consumption per capita
between 1996 and 1999 (in the data) was at or near the optimal level. (Of course, we are not
assuming that the Japanese economy was in steady-state between 1990-1999; we are only
assuming that consumers were optimizing in 1996-1999).

where µ t is the marginal utility of total assets, and φ t is the marginal utility of public capital.
Investment in public capital raises utility by raising output; on the other hand, investment in
public capital lowers utility because total assets decline. Thus,

µ$ t , φ$ t , and m
simulations, we take values culled from the literature. For γ , h, δ , r , and χ , we use 0.20,
0.012, 0.13,0.05, and 6. These values are fairly standard, except that since we have no
empirical data for the adjustment speed of public capital, we took the value 6 from the private
capital adjustment cost literature (Hayashi, 1982).
Our simulation strategy is to start from 2000 (from the actual values in the data, 199699), and simulate forward using the values of n t and α t . We imposed the condition that

$ t did not vary much from
φ (0) = µ (0) , and chose a value of φ (0) so that the path of m

5 years. As it turned out, given our parameter values, new steady states for m

$ t ; $jt (from (4)), k$ t (from (2)), $it (from (3)) and y$ t (from
Finally, from the path of m
(1)) can be calculated . Thus, we can calculate the private and public investment rates, which
are depicted in Tables 3 and 4.

Optimal Government Taxes.
It can be shown that c$ (0) is maximized when τ$ t is constant (Barro, 1979). That, is, the
government maximizes the path of consumption (and of utility) when lump-sum tax taxes per
effective population are constant, or that taxes per capita are growing at the rate h.
Satisfaction of the government’s intertemporal budget constraint (8) means that the
present value of lump-sum taxes per effective population is equal to the present value of
government spending per effective population:

where the discount rate, R t = exp( − ( r − h − n v )dv) . From (A5), we calculate the optimal

value of τ$ , from our estimated (exogenous) path of g$ t (from Tables 1 and 2), and our
simulated path of $jt (from above). In practice, we truncate the integral at 2050, since beyond
that, g$ t and $jt are discounted to the extent that they are negligibly small. By dividing τ$ t by

y$ t , we obtain the tax rate. Finally, from c$ t (above), g$ t , $jt , y$ t and τ$ t , we can calculate the
private and public saving rates that are depicted in Tables 3 and 4.
