Two of the pension systems have exogenous and four have endogenous contribution rates. I analyze both marginal and radical pension reforms for the purpose of making pension systems more stable, avoiding arbitrary redistibutions between generations and dealing with increased heterogeneity of the population in terms of family structure and international mobility. The advantages of combining PAYGO and actuarially fair systems are pointed out.\n\n",
