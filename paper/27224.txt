                                         ABSTRACT

We study the role of global supply chains in the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on GDP
growth for 64 countries. We discipline the labor supply shock across sectors and countries using
the fraction of work in the sector that can be done from home, interacted with the stringency with
which countries imposed lockdown measures. Using the quantitative framework and methods
developed in Huo, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020), we show that the average real GDP
downturn due to the Covid-19 shock is expected to be - 29:6%, with one quarter of the total due
to transmission through global supply chains. However, "renationalization" of global supply
chains does not in general make countries more resilient to pandemic-induced contractions in
labor supply. The average GDP drop would have been - 30:2%in a world without trade in inputs
and final goods. This is because eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases reliance on the
domestic inputs, which are also disrupted due to nationwide lockdowns. In fact, trade can insulate
a country imposing a stringent lockdown from the pandemic-shock, as its foreign inputs are less
disrupted than its domestic ones. Finally, unilateral lifting of the lockdowns in the largest
economies can contribute as much as 2.5% to GDP growth in some of their smaller trade partners.

1 Introduction
Much of the world is closely integrated through nal and intermediate goods trade.                   As countries

simultaneously curtail economic activity by means of domestic lockdown policies, the global economic

downturn may therefore be exacerbated by reductions in the supply of foreign intermediates, or

demand for a country's exports abroad (Baldwin, 2020). As a result, there is now a great deal of

speculation in both policy circles and popular press that the experience of the pandemic will in the

medium term lead to a renationalization of supply chains.
                                                                    1   However, it is an open question whether

supply chain renationalization would make GDP more resilient to pandemic-type shocks.                      A shift

from foreign to domestic intermediates would also change the relative size and shock responsiveness

of domestic sectors, and thus aect the reaction of the economy to a pandemic.


This paper quanties the role of the global supply chains in the economic impact of the Covid-19

pandemic using a model of world production and trade covering 64 countries on all continents and 33

sectors spanning all economic activities. We parameterize the model using the OECD Inter-Country

Input-Output (ICIO) Tables, that provide matrices of domestic and international intermediate in-

put and nal use trade.        We solve the model analytically using the techniques developed in Huo,

Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020).


We start by simulating a global lockdown as a contraction in labor supply. To discipline the relative

size of the labor contraction, we combine two pieces of information. First, we use the Dingel and

Neiman (2020) measure of the fraction of the work of dierent occupations that can be done at home.

Variation across sectors in their occupation usage and of countries in their sectoral employment

composition results in heterogeneous incidence of the shock across countries. Second, countries also

vary in the stringency of lockdown measures.             To capture this, we interact the work-from-home

intensity by occupation with an index capturing the country-level lockdown stringency from Hale

et al. (2020). Since this index is not a cardinal measure, we apply a monotonic transformation to

match the mean and the dispersion of the drop in Industrial Production in a subsample of countries

where these data are available. Though we do not target country-specic output changes, the model

predictions t the data well.


Not surprisingly, the model produces a large contraction of economic activity, with an average              29.6%
GDP drop in our sample of countries for the duration of the shock. Our focus is on the role of the

global supply chains in particular. To better understand how linkages between countries amplify or

mitigate the eect of the shock, we report two results. First, we compute the share of each country's

GDP contraction that is due to foreign, rather than domestic shocks. On average, about                    23.3%   of

the contraction of GDP comes from foreign shocks.


Second, we answer the more substantive question of whether participation in global supply chains

                                                          1
exacerbated or alleviated the pandemic-induced contraction in labor supply. Figuring this out re-

quires comparing the pandemic-induced GDP change in the baseline model to the pandemic-induced

GDP change in an alternative world without international trade, where supply chains have adjusted

to use only domestic inputs.


We nd that on average in our 64 countries the downturn would actually be slightly worse with

renationalized supply chains (−30.2%) than under current levels of trade. The reason is that elimi-

nating reliance on foreign inputs increases the reliance on domestic inputs. Since a pandemic-related

lockdown also aects domestic sectors, there is generally no resilience benet from renationalizing

the international supply chains.


There is a distribution of dierences around the average.      In some countries GDP would drop by

5-8 percentage points   more   if supply chains were renationalized, whereas in others GDP would fall

by about 4 percentage points     less.   The cross-country variation is well-explained by dierences in

lockdown severity across countries. Some countries  most prominently Japan, Taiwan, Sweden, or

Greece  impose less stringent lockdowns in response to the pandemic shock. The domestic pandemic-

induced shock is therefore smaller in these countries than the shock to their trading partners with

more severe lockdowns. Separating from the global supply chains would make these countries more

resilient to lockdowns by eliminating the transmission of the relatively larger shock from other coun-

tries.   By contrast, a country with the most severe lockdown will reduce its own domestic labor

supply by more than its average trading partner. In that case, the supply of the domestic intermedi-

ate inputs falls by more than the supply of foreign ones, and thus the GDP contraction is larger when

supply chains are renationalized. Thus, whether renationalizing supply chains insulates a country

from the pandemic depends on whether it plans to impose a more or less severe lockdown than its

trading partners.


It may be that while renationalizing all supply chains is not on average benecial, doing so in specic

sectors would improve resilience.    To investigate this possibility, we renationalize supply chains in

individual sectors one by one. There is no sector in which supply chain renationalization notably

improves resilience, measured either by GDP, or by value added of the sector itself.


Next, we address the interaction between the health crisis and global supply chains, by simulating

the lockdown in an environment of increased demand for health services.          We rst construct an

alternative high-health economy, in which the share of nal expenditure that goes to the Health

sector doubles in each country.     We then simulate the pandemic-driven labor supply contraction

in the baseline and high-health economies, and compare the results.       Because the Health sector

is not subject to the lockdown, the GDP contraction is modestly less severe in the high-health

scenario (average about 1 percentage point smaller contraction). Since the Health sector is largely

non-tradeable, increasing its size does not have a consistent impact on the relative importance of

international transmission.



                                                     2
Our last counterfactual tackles the recovery from the shock. Currently, countries decide on lifting

the lockdowns without international coordination. We thus simulate individual countries' decisions

to unilaterally allow workers to return to work, while the rest of the world remains in lockdown. Our

quantication suggests that most of the GDP impacts of the lockdown are domestic, and these are

reversed by reopening. We show that the unilateral reopenings of smaller countries such as Norway

or Austria (examples of countries who are currently rolling back lockdowns) have limited impacts on

GDP in other countries. By contrast, even unilateral reopening of large economies like China, US,

Germany, or Russia would have a noticeable impact on others. These countries' opening can raise

GDP in some of the most tightly linked countries by up to 2.5%.


We highlight that our exercises do not take into account the health consequences of the pandemic

itself, nor do we model the labor supply shock as being conditional on the infection rate in the

population.     We view this as reasonable in the current context where a very small fraction of the

population in most countries is directly aected by the disease at any point in time. Note that incor-

porating the infection rate into the calibration would only amplify the aggregate labor supply shock

and the GDP consequences in the baseline. We take this approach as most of our counterfactuals are

meant to capture the very short-run impact consequences of the shock. During the impact period,

infection rates are low and most of the labor force is not incapacitated.


Related Literature           Our paper complements the burgeoning body of work on the macroeconomic

impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (see, among others, Acemoglu et al., 2020; Atkeson, 2020; Alvarez,

Argente, and Lippi, 2020; Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt, 2020; Glover et al., 2020; Kaplan,

Moll, and Violante, 2020; Krueger, Uhlig, and Xie, 2020). Most closely related are Baqaee and Farhi

(2020a,b) and Barrot, Grassi, and Sauvagnat (2020), who study the eects of the lockdown on GDP

declines in input network economies, and Çakmakl et al. (2020), who explore transmission of demand

shocks in a small open economy context. Our focus is the international dimension of transmission

through global supply chains.


In that respect, we build on the the active recent research agenda on international shock propagation

in production networks.         We apply the framework and tools developed in Huo, Levchenko, and

Pandalai-Nayar (2020), who study the sources of international GDP comovement in a general multi-

country multi-sector multi-factor model with input linkages.               Also closely related is Baqaee and

Farhi (2019) and Allen, Arkolakis, and Takahashi (2020), who explore the impact of productivity,

factor supply, and trade cost shocks in a wide class of open-economy models. Our counterfactuals

simulate the labor supply shocks in an environment with endogenous labor supply, allowing for

propagation through input networks.

Johnson and Noguera (2012, 2017) and Caliendo and Parro (2015). Burstein, Kurz, and Tesar (2008), Bems, Johnson,
and Yi (2010), Johnson (2014), Eaton et al. (2016), and Eaton, Kortum, and Neiman (2016), among others, explore

run transmission and amplication of a natural disaster shock through trade linkages (Barrot and

Sauvagnat, 2016; Carvalho et al., 2016; Boehm, Flaaen, and Pandalai-Nayar, 2019). In contrast to

these papers, the Covid-19 pandemic oers a unique opportunity to quantify the consequences of a

synchronized labor supply shock. As highlighted by Imbs (2004) and Huo, Levchenko, and Pandalai-

Nayar (2020), both correlated shocks and transmission lead to synchronization of GDP growth, and

the relative importance of the two is a quantitative question.


The rest of the paper is organized as follows.                        Section 2 introduces the quantitative framework,

Section 3 describes the data and calibration, and Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 concludes.

This section sets up and solves a model of the global network of production and trade. The model

is an extension of the quantitative framework of Huo, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020), which

2.1    Setup


Preliminaries           Consider an economy comprised of                  N    countries indexed by   n   and   m   and   J   sectors

indexed by    j   and    i,   that produce using labor inputs from                    O   dierent occupations indexed by          `.
Each country      n   is populated by a representative household. The household consumes the nal good

available in country      n   and supplies labor and capital to rms. Trade is subject to iceberg costs                         τmnj

the role of input trade in shock transmission and business cycle comovement. Also related is the large empirical and
quantitative literature on the positive association between international trade and comovement (e.g. Frankel and Rose,
1998; Imbs, 2004; Kose and Yi, 2006; di Giovanni and Levchenko, 2010; Ng, 2010; Liao and Santacreu, 2015; di Giovanni,
Levchenko, and Mejean, 2018; Drozd, Kolbin, and Nosal, 2020).




                                                                      4
where     Fn   is consumption of nal goods,          Ln`      is the labor hours supplied in occupation                               `, ξn`      is the

occupation-specic labor supply shock, and                   Knj       is the amount of installed capital in sector                            j   which

is assumed to be exogenous. Labor in occupation                         `   collects a wage             Wn` ,   and capital is rented at the

price    Rnj .3

The utility function is an extension of the Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Human (1988) preferences,

that produce an especially simple isoelastic labor supply curve that only depends on the real wage:

                                                                                    ψ

                                                  Ln` =        ξn`                        .
                                                                               Pn

We highlight two features of our preference formulation that will be important for the analysis that

follows. First, labor is dierentiated by occupation. This feature captures imperfect inter-occupation

labor mobility in the short run, appropriate in this application. Second, the labor supply is subject

to country-occupation-specic shocks             ξn` .   This exibility is needed to capture the fact that not all

occupations experienced the same contractions in labor supply, as some jobs can be more easily done

at home. In a similar vein, there is heterogeneity in lockdown severity across countries, that once

again can be captured by variation in            ξn` .       Through the lens of our model, the worldwide lockdown

policies are a vector of labor supply shocks                  ξn` .    Our quantitative analysis will trace the impact of

these    ξn`   shocks on the world economy under various assumptions on the structure of production

and trade.

of these groupings, one of these will be healthcare.                            In one of our simulations, we will consider a

pandemic-induced increase in demand for healthcare, by raising its preference weight                                                 ζnq .

       As our focus is on understanding the impact eect of the pandemic on GDP growth, we focus on the contempo-
raneous impact of the shocks in our application. We assume the capital stock remains xed. In Huo, Levchenko, and
Pandalai-Nayar (2020), we provide a full quantication of the relative importance of contemporaneous vs. intertemporal
correlation in a more general setting and show that the contemporaneous eect of shocks dominates.

2.2      Analytical Solution


We now provide an analytical expression for the global inuence matrix.                        In general, closed-form

solutions for the exact inuence vectors cannot be obtained in multi-country multi-sector models

such as ours. However, Huo, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) show that in this framework we

can solve for the rst-order approximation of the inuence vector. Denote by ln the log-deviation

from steady state/pre-shock equilibrium.

Of course, the     ln Hnj   in (2.6) are equilibrium outcomes. To solve the model, we have to express them

composite labor changes, and the vector         ln ξ   of length   NO    collect the worldwide occupation-specic

In addition, η and α are matrices of output elasticities, Πf and Πx are matrices of nal consumption
and intermediate shares, respectively, ΠO is the matrix of occupational shares by sector, Λ is a matrix
of sectoral employment shares by occupation, and P summarizes how prices respond to output changes

which combines both structural elasticities and spending shares.5

Equations (2.7)-(2.9) illustrate that all we need to understand the response of worldwide output to

various occupation-country shocks in this quantitative framework are measures of steady state nal

goods consumption and production shares, the distribution of occupations across sectors, as well as

model elasticities. We refer to the matrix              (I − G)−1 ΠO ∆−1      that encodes the equilibrium responses

of worldwide labor inputs to the worldwide vector of shocks as the                     inuence matrix.
In equation (2.7), the term            ∆−1 ln ξ    reects how wages in dierent occupations respond to supply

shocks holding the quantities and prices in all goods markets xed. A shock in occupation                        ` not only
aects wages for occupation             `,   but also spills over to other occupations. The former is captured by
κ+ψ                                  1−κ   O
1+ψ I, and the latter is captured by 1+ψ ΛΠ . Importantly, the elasticity                      κ   has opposite eects on

these two terms, leaving the total wage response independent of                    κ   when the magnitude of the labor

supply shock is uniform across occupations. The matrix                  ΠO   measures the exposures of sectoral labor
                                                   O −1 translates changes in wages to changes
inputs to wages in dierent occupations, and thus Π ∆

in labor.


The expression in (2.8) is a block diagonal matrix, implying a null partial equilibrium response to

foreign shocks. Once we allow the goods markets to respond, the global supply chain starts to play

a role and transmission across countries will be present. The matrix                     (I − G)−1   encodes the general

equilibrium response of sectoral labor composite in a country to shocks in any sector-country, taking

into account the full model structure and all direct and indirect links between the countries and

sectors.        The model solution (2.7)-(2.9) resembles the typical solution to a network model, that

writes the equilibrium change in output as a product of the Leontief inverse and the vector of shocks.

Our expression also features a vector of shocks, and an inverse of a matrix that is more complicated

due to the multi-country structure of our model combined with elastic factor supply and non-unitary

elasticities of substitution.


The main advantage of the rst-order solution above is transparency. The GDP change is represented

as a linear combination of primitive shocks, allowing additive decompositions of the GDP change

that illuminate the forces at work.               An alternative is an exact solution of the model.             Figure A3

compares the exact and rst-order solutions. In our application, the rst-order and exact solutions

are quite close.

Clearly, the overall response of labor is increasing in the Frisch elasticity                         ψ.   It also underscores

that the exact general equilibrium feedback eects hinge on various steady-state shares. When the

nal goods or intermediate goods aggregates deviate from the Cobb-Douglas case, the global goods

demand system (2.3) is more complex and the matrix                          P   that governs the responses of prices enters

the inuence matrix (2.7).


2.3      Accounting Decompositions


To illustrate how we will use the model above to understand the impact of global supply chains on

GDP growth during the pandemic, we next present some simple accounting decompositions of do-

mestic GDP growth. These build on the more general accounting framework used in Huo, Levchenko,

and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) to study GDP comovement.


The linear representation of the GDP change in country                      n as a function of the global vector of shocks
(2.6)-(2.9) lends itself to an additive decomposition of the GDP change into the components due to

domestic and foreign shocks. To rst order, the log deviation of real GDP of country                            n   from steady

state can be written as:
                                                            XX
                                             ln Vn ≈                    smn` ln ξm` ,                                    (2.11)
                                                            m       `

where     smn`   are the elasticities of the GDP of country                     n   with respect to shocks in occupation     `,
country     m,   characterized by (2.6)-(2.9).


Contribution of foreign lockdowns to GDP contractions                                     To highlight the eects of domestic

and foreign shocks on GDP, separate the double sum in (2.11) into the component due to country

n's   own shocks (Dn ) and the component due to all the trade partners' shocks (Tn ):

                                             X                          XX
                                   ln Vn =           snn` ln ξn` +                  smn` ln ξm` .                        (2.12)
                                                 `                      m6=n `

                                                      Dn                             Tn

Below, we report the fraction of the overall downturn that can be attributed to foreign, rather than

domestic, labor contractions:        Tn / ln Vn ,    for each country in our sample.
                                                                                                  7

      In this case,   P = −I.
  7
      It is immediate that the inuence matrix can also be used to trace out the eect of shocks in a particular country
(e.g. China) on the GDP growth in a partner (e.g. the US).




                                                                10
Renationalization of global supply chains                   There is now a great deal of speculation in policy

circles and popular press that the pandemic will lead to a renationalization of the global supply

chains, to protect against similar shocks in the future. In our model transmission is positive, in the

sense that an adverse foreign shock lowers a country's GDP. The sign and size of the contribution of

foreign shocks is informative, but does not imply that the presence of global value chains exacerbated

the GDP contraction due to the lockdown.


To establish this type of result, we need to compare the contraction in the baseline model to an

alternative in which the global supply chains have been renationalized. We construct such a version

of the world economy by raising iceberg trade costs to innity in both intermediate and nal good

uses. We then shock each country with the same size lockdown as in the baseline world economy.

If the GDP contraction with renationalized supply chains is smaller than the one in the baseline,

we conclude that a country's participation in the global value chains exacerbated the downturn,

and vice versa. To understand the results that appear below, we can write the GDP change in the

renationalized equilibrium (R) following the shock as:

                                                            X
                                              ln VnR =           sR
                                                                  nn` ξn` ,                                    (2.13)
                                                             `


where   sR
         nn`   is the elasticity of country   n's   GDP to a shock in occupation          `   in the renationalized

equilibrium. By denition, in this case the country is immune to foreign shocks, and only responds

to domestic shocks.


Comparing (2.12) and (2.13), the dierence in the GDP response in the baseline relative to autarky

is a sum of two parts:

                                                    X
                              ln Vn − ln VnR =              snn` − sR
                                                                       
                                                                    nn` ξn` + Tn .                             (2.14)
                                                        `
                                                    |             {z          }
                                                 Change in Domestic Inuence

The second component,       Tn ,   is straightforward:      in autarky, the country is not subject to foreign

shocks, so holding all else xed the downturn is smaller in autarky if the rest of the world experiences

a bad shock.


However, the rst term captures an additional eect. Absent international trade, the responsiveness

of the economy to domestic shocks would also be dierent.                     Some sectors grow in inuence as a

country opens to trade, others shrink. Whether or not participation in global trade exacerbates the

downturn is determined by how the altered sensitivity to domestic shocks (snn`                 − sR
                                                                                                  nn` )   compares to

the eliminated sensitivity to foreign shocks.


To better understand the change in the domestic inuence term, note that the change in the labor




                                                            11
input can be written as a sum of the partial and general equilibrium impacts of the shocks:



                                           ln H = D ln ξ + Γ ln ξ                                        (2.15)

                                                  Partial Eq.   General Eq.

Combining (2.6), (2.14), and (2.15), the dierence between the trade and the renationalized equilibria

can be written as:

The dierence in the GDP change between the trade and renationalized equilibria can be decomposed

into three eects. The PE eect captures the reweighting of the sectors towards, or away from, those

more exposed to the lockdown.           For instance, if when going from the renationalized to the trade

equilibrium Domar weights grow in sectors more immune to lockdowns, the country will be more

insulated from lockdowns under trade, all else equal.

                                                                                                 1+ψ O
The matrix governing the partial equilibrium response to shocks is simple:               D =     κ+ψ Π .     By

construction,       D is block-diagonal by country, as only shocks to domestic occupational groups directly
aect domestic hours. It can be directly constructed from data on occupational shares and labor-

related elasticities, and thus does not require solving the model. The PE response matrix          D captures
the direct eect of the shocks to occupations in the home country on sectoral labor in the home

country.     That is, it traces the shift of the labor supply curve in occupation        `,   holding all other

markets xed (including domestic labor markets in other occupations). The magnitude of this shift

is   (1 + ψ) ln ξn` ,   governed by the Frisch elasticity. The needed adjustment in the wage rate       Wn`   is
  1+ψ                                                                                    −1 ) and the supply
− ψ+κ    ln ξn` ,   which encodes the information on the slope of the demand curve (ψ

curve (κ
           −1 ). The change in the wage rate translates into the change in the composite labor in sector
                                                                                  1+ψ O

The domestic GE term captures the change in the general equilibrium eects of domestic shocks

between the two equilibria. It reects the fact that the renationalization of global supply chains will

rearrange domestic input usage, and as a result the impact of domestic shocks on the home economy.

The matrix of general equilibrium adjustments           Γ   includes the spillover eects to labor markets in

other occupations, and the indirect eects on domestic and global goods markets. Computing the

GE term term requires the solution to the full general equilibrium model, as it encodes the change

in the propagation of occupation-specic shocks through the rest of the economy through product

3 Data and Calibration
Labor shock                To calibrate the size of the labor shock, we use three pieces of data.                     The rst is

the classication of occupations by whether they can be performed at home by Dingel and Neiman

(2020).
               9   We then combine this occupation-specic work from home intensity with the country-

specic lockdown intensity constructed by the Oxford Blavatnik School of Government Coronavirus

Government Response Tracker (Hale et al., 2020, henceforth GRT). This index ranges from 0 to 100,

and we treat it as a proportion indicator, 1 being a full lockdown. These data are recorded daily.

We take the maximum value in each country up to April 30, 2020.


While the variation across countries in lockdown severity can be captured by the GRT index, it is

not meant to be a cardinal measure, and the elasticity of the labor supply with respect to this index

is unknown. We thus curve the GRT index to t a lognormal distribution, where we choose the mean

and variance to match the mean and the range of the fall in the April 2020 Industrial Production

(IP) for the countries for which these data are currently available.
                                                                                             10

The labor supply shift in occupation               `   and country   n   relative to the pre-shock steady state is then:



                                     ln ξn` = − (1 − work from home` ) × f (GRTn ) ,                                         (3.1)



The exception is the Health sector, which receives no labor supply shock as it is not subject to

lockdowns.            The robustness section below shows that none of the main conclusions change if we

simply treat the GRT index as a cardinal measure of the percentage of labor supply contraction

(f   (GRTn ) = GRTn ).11
     8
         The   Γ   matrix is:                  (        ∞                         ∞
                                                                          k                          )
                                         1+ψ            X   κ−1                    X
                                   Γ=              ΠO               ΛΠO        +         G k ΠO ∆−1       .
                                         κ+ψ                  κ+ψ
                                                        k=1                        k=1

The rst term in the curly brackets captures the impact of labor supply shocks on one occupation on demand for
other occupations' labor inputs. The second term reects the propagation of a supply shock to a particular occupation
through the input and nal goods markets worldwide.
     9
         We use Dingel and Neiman (2020)'s O*NET-derived classication.                  Notice that in the context of the Covid-19
pandemic, this is a conservative shock, as school closures and other lockdown measures likely imply that the actual
occupation-related tasks performed at home are less than those that are feasible.
  10
         The advantage of IP data is that they are released promptly and are at the monthly frequency. The disadvantage
is that they only cover the manufacturing sector, and thus must be lined up with manufacturing sector output rather
than GDP in our model. We obtained April 2020 IP data for 39 of our 64 countries from the OECD, Eurostat, and
some national statistical agencies. The April 2020 IP contraction is dened as the log dierence with respect to the
maximum 3-month moving average in the previous 12 months (meant to capture contraction relative to the peak). See
appendix B.2 for details about the curving.
  11
         In practice, the adjustment to the average size of the shock to match the IP drop is minimal. Using the raw GRT
produces a 30.1% fall in manufacturing output in the set of countries for which we found IP data, compared to 28.7%
in the data. Using raw GRT undershoots the dispersion in IP changes across countries substantially.

Notes: This table summarizes the parameters and data targets used in the baseline quantitative model, and their
sources. For    αj   and   ηj ,   the table reports the 10th and 90th percentiles of the range of these parameters. Alternative
parameters are considered in Appendix B.




Sectoral occupation composition                         To compute the occupation shares by sector, we use US data

from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This dataset reports the number of workers in each occupation

employed in each NAICS sector, together with their average annual wage. We convert this to our

ISIC-based industry classication, and use it to compute the sectoral expenditure shares on each

occupation. Because workers in the health services are not aected by the lockdown measures, we

create a special composite health occupation that is used by the Health Services sector only, and

does not incur a negative labor supply shock. Our nal occupational classication is similar to the 23

SOC major groups, minus the Military-Specic Occupations and with an extra Health Composite

occupation.       Appendix Table A1 lists our occupational classication together with the work from

home intensities.           Since data on industry occupational composition are unavailable for countries

other than the US, we assume that the shares are similar across countries.
                                                                                                 12


Trade, input, and consumption shares                             The data requirements for calibrating this model is

the information on the world input-output matrix and nal use. We use the OECD Inter-Country

Input-Output (ICIO) Tables. These data cover 64 countries on all continents and 33 sectors spanning

the entire economy. We use the information for the latest available year, 2015. We separate the 33

sectors into 3 groups for nal consumption: Goods, Services, and Health. Appendix Table A2 lists

the countries, and Appendix Table A3 lists the sectors along with the breakdown into groups.

  12
       This is consistent with our assumption that sectoral production functions are the same across countries and the
elasticity of substitution across occupations equal to 1.




                                                                   14
Structural parameters                To construct the inuence matrix (2.7) we must also take a stand on a

few elasticities.   Table 1 summarizes the parameters in our baseline calibration.               Huo, Levchenko,

and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) estimate a nal goods substitution elasticity              γ   between 1 and 2.75. Since

ours is a very short-run application, we take the lower value of 1, and apply it to all groups. We

set the intermediate input substitution elasticity           ε    to 0.5. The notion that inputs are complements

at business cycle frequencies is consistent with the estimates by Atalay (2017) and Boehm, Flaaen,

and Pandalai-Nayar (2019).             We calibrate the cross-group substitution elasticity       ρ   to 0.2 in our

baseline, following the estimates from the structural transformation literature suggesting that broad

services and manufacturing aggregates are complements (Herrendorf, Rogerson, and Valentinyi, 2013;

Cravino and Sotelo, 2019; Comin, Lashkari, and Mestieri, 2020). In the baseline we set the Frisch

labor supply elasticity    ψ   of 2 for all occupations. Finally, we set the sectoral elasticity of substitution

across occupations    κ   to   1,   close to the value of   0.9   found by Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2014).

As detailed in Sections 2.2-2.3, the magnitudes of domestic and international GE eects are governed

by these elasticities. Appendix B reports the results of our quantitative exercises under alternative

elasticities.


All other parameters in the model have close counterparts in basic data and thus we compute them

directly. Capital shares in total output         αj   and value added shares in gross output     ηj   come from the

KLEMS and OECD STAN databases, and are averaged in each sector across countries to reduce

noise.

3.1          Basic Facts


How economies react to the labor shock stemming from the pandemic depends on the fraction of

work that can be performed from home. Appendix Table A4 shows the sectoral shares of employees

whose occupation can be done from home, computed as a sector-specic weighted average of the

occupation measures.       There is substantial sectoral variation in the shares, ranging from 11% in

the accommodation and food services sector, to 90% in the IT sector. Overall, service sectors have

a higher share, with the notable exception of the Human Health and Social Work sector. Because

sectors have dierent labor shares, however, the share of work that cannot be done from home doesn't

precisely capture the exposure of a sector to the labor shock. The last column of the table displays

the sectoral exposure, dened as       (1 − αj )ηj (1 − work from homej ).    These are uniformly lower, since

the labor shares in gross output are far less than 1, but still feature considerable variation across

sectors.

 Notes: This gure displays the share of foreign intermediate inputs as a share of sectoral intermediate purchases.
 The blue dashed horizontal line is the cross-sector mean.




The eective severity of the labor supply shock will vary across countries as a function of both

sectoral composition and lockdown stringency.                Table 2 lists the top 10 and bottom 10 countries

according to the share of aggregate labor that can be performed at home. This share is computed

as the sectoral labor compensation-weighted average of the sectoral shares of work that can be done

from home. Among the top 10 are several developed economies such as the US, United Kingdom or

Luxembourg, consistent with their large service sector size. Table 2 also lists the top and bottom 10

countries in terms of lockdown stringency.


Exposure to foreign inputs will also determine the extent to which each country is aected by

international shock propagation.        Figure 1 displays the share of inputs that each country sources

from abroad. There is a fair bit of variation, ranging from less than 10% in countries least integrated

into global supply chains to over 50% in the most integrated countries. Figure 2 displays the world

average of same measure at the sectoral level.            As expected, manufacturing sectors tend to have

higher imported input shares than services.


4 Main Results
GDP contraction and the contribution of foreign shocks                       The blue-white combination bars

in the top panel of Figure 3 display the GDP drops across all countries in our baseline model

following the labor supply shock. The four panels group countries into geographical regions. The

GDP reductions are dramatic, at         −29.6%      on average. There is a signicant amount of dispersion,

with GDP reductions ranging from             −11%   in Sweden and Taiwan to     −67%     in Argentina and India.


The white parts of the bars denote the contribution of foreign shocks            Tn .   It is evident that without

exception, foreign shocks transmitted through the global supply chains constitute a sizable minority

of the overall GDP contraction. The mean contribution of foreign shocks to the fall in GDP is               23.3%



                                                         17
of the total. Appendix Tables A5-A6 lists the GDP changes and the elements of the decomposition

underlying Figure 3 for every country in the sample.


Renationalization of the global supply chains                      To answer whether participation in the global

supply chains makes economies more vulnerable to pandemic-related lockdowns, we must solve for

the GDP contraction under the same magnitude of a shock, but in a counterfactual economy in which

the supply chains have been renationalized. We construct the renationalization scenario as follows.

Starting from today's world economy, we increase iceberg trade costs to a very high value, and solve

for the new production equilibrium following the exact hat algebra approach of Dekle, Eaton, and

Kortum (2008). One subtlety with this exercise is that to nd the renationalized equilibrium we raise

the substitution elasticities above 1. This is because when elasticities are below 1, expenditure shares

on foreign goods increase in iceberg trade costs. Raising the substitution elasticities above 1 captures

the notion that supply chain renationalization will be a medium- to long-run adjustment, and thus

should be governed by higher substitution elasticities.                It also delivers the sensible outcome that

raising trade costs to very high levels eliminates cross-border trade.
                                                                                   13   We obtain virtually the same

results if we construct the renationalized equilibrium by simply reapportioning foreign spending

to domestic suppliers by at.            In Appendix B.4, we also show that the results of an alternative

renationalization scenario, where only intermediate iceberg trade costs are raised while leaving nal

good trade costs unchanged, are similar.


The gray bars in the top panel of Figure 3 plot counterfactual declines in GDP for the same shock in

a world where supply chains are domestic. It turns out that GDP declines would actually be larger

in this counterfactual world economy for a majority of countries. The mean decline in GDP in the

renationalized equilibrium is        −30.2% in our sample, slightly worse than the decline with international
supply chains. The renationalized equilibrium also features larger cross-country dispersion of GDP

changes. The standard deviation of GDP changes is 16% in the renationalized scenario compared

to 13% under trade (Table A7). Not surprisingly, participation in global supply chains synchronizes

GDP changes across countries.


To help understand this result, the bottom panel of Figure 3 implements the accounting decom-

position (2.16). The blue bars are the dierence in GDP change in trade relative to autarky, the

left-hand side of (2.16). A positive value of the bar indicates that GDP falls by                  less   in the current

trade equilibrium relative to the renationalization scenario, that is, global supply chains mitigate the

fall in GDP. The light gray bars are the transmission terms              Tn , which are all negative.     All else equal,

GDP falls by more in the trade equilibrium because foreign shocks can now also reduce domestic

GDP.

       Our baseline calibration to elasticities below 1 is meant to reect that we are capturing the very short-run eects
of the pandemic lockdowns. Boehm, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) provide a mutually consistent set of trade
elasticity estimates, and show that the elasticity is below 1 in the short run, but above 1 in the long run.

                         Dierence in GDP Change between Trade and Renationalized Equilibria


 Notes:         The top panel of this gure displays the change in GDP following the labor supply shock described in
 Section 3. The rst bar represents the change in GDP under trade, decomposed into domestic shock (dark blue) and
 transmission (cream bar). The second bar represents the change in GDP under renationalization. Tables A5 and A6
 in Appendix B.3 display the specic numbers. The bottom panel decomposes the change in the reaction of GDP to
                                                                   T
 the labor supply shock between the baseline trade economy (ln Vn ) and the renationalized supply chains economy
      R
 (ln Vn ), according to the decomposition in equation (2.16). The blue bar is the total dierence, the white bar is the
 transmission, the red bar is the change in domestic GE, and the light green bar is the change in domestic PE.

The transmission terms paint an incomplete picture, however, because the inuence of domestic

sectors will also change. The white and dark gray bars plot the changes in the PE and GE components

of domestic inuence. The total change in domestic inuence (the sum of both stacked bars) is always

positive: in the trade equilibrium, most economies are   more   resilient to their own domestic shocks

than they would be in autarky. The change in the partial equilibrium term is negligible for most

countries, implying that most of the change in domestic inuence comes through general equilibrium

eects.


The net result of these opposing eects is that most countries would experience smaller GDP reduc-

tions in the current trade equilibrium than they would in a world of renationalized global supply

chains. Put plainly, eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases reliance on the domestic inputs.

Since a pandemic-related lockdown also aects domestic sectors, on average there is no benet of

resilience from renationalizing the international supply chains.


There is variation across countries, however.   A number of important economies: Japan, Taiwan,

Sweden, and the US, among others, would be more resilient to the pandemic-related lockdown if their

supply chains were renationalized. The opposite is true of some Latin American (Peru, Argentina,

Colombia) and Asian (Philippines, India) countries.


To better understand this variation, the left panel of Figure 4 plots the combined general equilibrium

terms (domestic GE term and international transmission) against a country's lockdown stringency.

There is a tight positive relationship between the two, with a bivariate   R2   of close to   0.9.   Countries

with most stringent lockdowns are better o with international supply chains, and vice versa. This

is intuitive. A country with the most stringent lockdown is trading with countries with less severe

lockdowns. Thus, the reduction in the supply of foreign inputs is lower than the reduction in the

corresponding domestic inputs, since these are subject to a severe lockdown.


To highlight a source of remaining variation, the right panel of Figure 4 plots the change in domestic

PE against the change in the country-level exposure to the labor shock, dened as the Domar-

weighted sectoral exposure from Table A4. A country where participation in international supply

chains increases the size of sectors where work cannot be done from home becomes relatively less

resilient to domestic shocks in the trade equilibrium, and vice versa. As evident from the bottom

panel of Figure 3, the PE component is barely perceptible for most countries, and so a reshuing

of employment across sectors with dierent work-from-home intensities is not a large eect quanti-

tatively.


Renationalizing supply chains in individual sectors             It may be that while renationalizing

all trade is not generally benecial, renationalizing specic sectors' supply chains can systematically

improve resilience. To check whether this is the case, we examine a set of counterfactuals in which we

Notes: This gure presents scatterplots of the terms of the decomposition (2.16) against heuristic measures. The
right panel displays the change in domestic PE against the change in the country-level exposure, computed as the
Domar-weighted sum of sectoral exposure in from Table A4. The left panel displays the sum of the change in GE and
Transmission against the country lockdown stringency. The lines through the data are OLS ts. The boxes report

renationalize supply chains of each sector one at a time. That is, we force all inputs in one specic

sector to be sourced domestically.                                                          We then subject this counterfactual economy to the lockdown

shock, and compare the GDP contraction to the baseline, as we did for the full renationalization

scenario.


The top panel of Figure 5 reports the results. For each sector, it presents a box plot of the dierence

in the GDP change in the baseline relative to the counterfactual in which that sector's inputs are

sourced domestically. A value of zero on the y-axis implies that there is no dierence in the lockdown-

driven GDP change in this counterfactual relative to the baseline. The box depicts the interquartile

range of country-specic GDP change dierences, while whiskers extend to the adjacent values.

The outlier countries are labeled.


The main conclusion is that when it comes to GDP changes, renationalizing individual sectors has

a minimal impact. The mean dierence in GDP changes is a small fraction of a percent, and the

variation across countries is tight around zero. Even outliers almost never amount to a more than a

1.2% absolute dierence, relative to the GDP reductions of 29.6% on average.


It may be that while the resilience benets of renationalizing supply chains in a particular sector

are small for GDP, they are large for that particular sector.                                                                                                           The bottom panel of Figure 5 plots

instead the dierence in the value added change of that sector when its supply chain is renationalized

 Notes: The top panel depicts the dierence in country-level GDP change due to the lockdown, between the baseline
 scenario and a scenario where the individual sector's supply chain is renationalized. The bottom panel depicts the
 dierence in the sector's real value added change due to the lockdown, between the baseline scenario and a scenario
 where that sector's supply chain is renationalized.




and the baseline.                               Once again, the averages cross countries as well as the interquartile ranges are

very close to zero. As expected, there are a few more visible outliers, but even for most outliers the




                                                                                                               22
absolute dierence between the baseline and renationalization is small. Notably, the supply chain

renationalization in the Health sector beings the most visible benet on average, and the highest

dispersion in outcomes.       Nonetheless, while the values are large relative to other sector, they are

negligible in absolute terms. All in all, there appears to be no systematic benet of resilience to the

sector from renationalizing its supply chain.


Fit    While our calibration of the size of the shock used a log-normal transformation to approximate

the average fall in IP and its dispersion, we did not target the variation in output contractions across

countries in the sample. The left panel of Figure 6 plots the April 2020 IP contraction in the data

on the y-axis against the manufacturing output contraction implied by the model, along with the

45-degree line. The IP data are available for       39 countries.      Circle sizes are proportional to total GDP

of the country.    There is a clear positive correlation (0.56) between the data and the model.                   We

do not target a perfect t. The lack of a perfect t is sensible, as the model is subjected to only

one, fairly parsimoniously specied exogenous shock, whereas the data are presumably generated by

many shocks. In addition, up-to-date IP data are available for only about two-thirds of the countries

in the sample.


The right panel of Figure 6 plots the February to May sectoral employment change in the US from

the Real-Time Population Survey (Bick, Blandin, and Mertens, 2020), against the model-implied

change in sectoral composite hours. Again, while we do not target the sectoral labor input changes

to calibrate our shock, the correlation is positive at         0.61.

Sensitivity      Appendix B.4 discusses the main results under alternative values of                 ρ, ε, κ,   and   ψ.
A higher elasticity in the nal goods aggregator,         ρ,   makes a country less sensitive to the variation

in other countries' production.       Therefore the importance of the transmission term                Tn   is smaller

in this case.   When we change        ρ   from 0.2 to 1, the average share of contribution of transmission

in GDP reduction decreases by 1.5% in the trade economy.                     Raising the elasticity of substitution

between intermediate inputs       ε   to 1 has a minimal impact on the overall GDP contraction, but

reduces the importance of transmission to          16%   of the total.         The elasticity across occupations      κ
matters for how a shock in one occupation spills over to other occupations. In our exercises, almost

all occupations are aected and few sectors concentrate on a particular occupation to the exclusion

of others.   Therefore, the quantitative eect of varying              κ   is mild.   With a lower Frisch elasticity

ψ,   workers are less responsive to negative labor supply shocks. As a result, the total fall in GDP

is smaller and the relative importance of domestic GE and international transmission is weakened.

When changing the Frisch elasticity from 2 to 1, the average GDP reduction changes from                     29.6%     to

26.5%.   Even with   ψ = 1,   the GE eects remain the main driving force of the GDP changes. When

ψ = 0.2,   the PE eects start to play a role comparable to the GE eects. All in all, the directions

and magnitudes of the eects discussed in our baseline model are not especially sensitive to                     ρ, ε,

and    κ,    and vary in an intuitive way with                                               ψ.      The nal robustness exercise treats the Government

Response Index as a cardinal measure of lockdown stringency. The index, that varies from 0 to 1,

is treated as a percentage change in labor supply. The raw GRT index produces a similar average

contraction in GDP (30.2%), but undershoots substantially on the dispersion in GDP changes across

countries. The share of international transmission in the total GDP contraction, or the comparison

between autarky and trade are quite similar to the baseline.


Increased long-run demand for health services                                                                      Our next counterfactual simulates a pandemic

shock in a world with permanently increased demand for health services. To do this, we rst compute

a new pre-shock high-health steady state, in which the share of health expenditures in total nal

expenditures is twice as large as in the baseline. The mean share of health expenditures is 5% in our

sample of countries, and thus in the high-health scenario it increases to 10% for the average country.

We then simulate the same lockdown in this alternative economy.                                                                        The experiment is designed to

reect the fact that the Health sector becomes more important in the pandemic.


The blue bars in Figure 7 plot the dierence in GDP change in the high-health economy relative to

the baseline economy. A positive value indicates that the GDP downturn is less severe in the high-

health scenario. All the values are positive, which is sensible as the Health sector is not subject to

scenario (ln Vn ) and the baseline (ln Vn ). The blue bar is the total dierence, the white bar is the dierence in

the lockdown, and thus increasing the relative size of the health sector will lead to a smaller GDP

contraction. The dierence is small overall, ranging from 0.2% to 3% (whereas the GDP fall is on

the order of 29%).


The white, orange and light green bars in Figure 7 implement the PE/GE/International transmission

decomposition (2.16). The light green bar displays the dierence in domestic PE. In this experiment,

the domestic PE eect is the largest, accounting for the majority of the total GDP change.                      The

dierence in GDP contraction in the high-health economy compared to the baseline is accounted

for by the fact that the high-health economy reallocates expenditure towards the sector not subject

to the negative labor supply shock. The domestic GE eect is in red. It ends up being positive, but

small. We conjecture that the relatively small domestic GE eect here is due to the fact that the

Health sector uses relatively few intermediate inputs, and thus its ability to stimulate demand for

upstream inputs is limited. The change in international transmission, in white, is small compared to

the domestic eects, and changes sign from country to country. This is consistent with the fact that

the health sector is relatively non-tradeable and uses few foreign inputs.


Reopening        Finally, we simulate the lifting of the lockdown restrictions. The model does not ex-

hibit asymmetries in the responses to positive vs. negative shocks. Thus, the GDP change following

a worldwide end to the lockdown is essentially the negative of the GDP changes reported in Figure



                                                        25
3. By the same token, the negative of the blue bars in the gure show what would happen if to an

individual country's GDP if it were the only one to reopen while the rest of the world stayed in lock-

down. Since most of the GDP impact is due to the domestic lockdown policies, unilateral reopening

will achieve most of the GDP rebound even if other countries stay under lockdown. Similarly, the

negative of the white portions of the bars give GDP changes in the opposite scenario: the rest of the

world lifts restrictions while the country in question stays under lockdown. As long as the country

itself is under lockdown, the bounceback expected from foreign opening is comparatively modest.


To give the opening scenarios a bit more texture, and because the timing of lockdown removals is

likely to be staggered across countries, we simulate lifting the lockdowns country-by-country. The

top panel of Figure 8 plots the change in the rest of the world's GDP when the country on the x-axis

lifts its lockdown. Not surprisingly, opening of the largest economies  US, China, Russia, Germany,

Japan  would have the greatest impact on others. By contrast, since most countries are small, their

opening will have a negligible impact on the rest of the world. The middle and bottom panels of

Figure 8 display the GDP change in the country on the x-axis following the end of the lockdowns in

the US and China, respectively. These countries' opening can raise GDP in some of the most tightly

linked countries by up to 1-2.5% in some cases.


Appendix Figure A2 plots the entire matrix of other countries' GDP changes.         The axis labeled

Source refers to the country whose reopening is being simulated. The axis labeled Destination

refers to the country whose GDP change is being plotted. Thus, the gure plots the GDP change

in Destination following the lifting of a lockdown in Source. Countries on both axes are sorted

in descending order of impact. Thus, countries in the left end of the Source axis are those whose

opening has the largest impact on other countries in the world. Finally, we suppress the own country

impact, as those values would swamp the variation in the plots (this explains the scattered blanks

in the picture).


5 Conclusion
Global supply chains are a central feature of the world economy. As most countries go into lockdowns,

there are concerns about both the present and the future. In the present, global supply chains are

widely believed to transmit the crisis across countries. The future is forecasted to bring about at

least some renationalization of the supply chains.


This paper performs a quantitative assessment of the role of global supply chains in the pandemic.

While foreign lockdowns undoubtedly contribute to the size of economic downturns experienced by

countries, the majority of GDP contractions come from the domestic lockdown policies.         By and

large, severing global supply chains will not make countries more resilient to pandemic-style labor

supply shocks. This is because reducing the importance of foreign inputs mechanically increases the




                                                  26
importance of domestic inputs. If domestic inputs are also subject to lockdowns, renationalization

doesn't help mitigate the size of the contraction.       Renationalization will make the economy more

resilient if the country plans to have a less stringent lockdown then its trading partners, and vice

versa.

Appendix A Inuence vector
Proof of Proposition 1:                 The derivation of the inuence vector follows closely the steps in Huo, Levchenko,
and Pandalai-Nayar (2020). In this appendix, we derive the inuence matrix under the assumption that there is
only one group for the nal good consumption. The more general case with multiple groups is a straightforward
extension of the current analysis.

Notes: The rst column reports the share of the labor input that can be provided from home, by sector. The sectoral
measure is computed as an average of Dingel and Neiman (2020)'s work from home intensity at the occupational
level, weighted using sectoral level expenditure shares on each occupation. The second column reports the sectoral
exposure, dened as the share of total output accounted for by labor that cannot be done from home,   (1 − αj )ηj (1 −
work from homej ).

B.2    Curving of the stringency index


We obtained Industrial Production (IP) data up to April 2020 for 39 of our 64 countries from the OECD,
Eurostat, and some national statistical agencies (for Argentina, India, Taiwan, and Australia). The April 2020
IP contraction is dened as the log dierence with respect to the maximum 3-month moving average in the
previous 12 months (meant to capture contraction relative to the peak). In practice, we drop the countries
with the three biggest and smallest falls to avoid extreme values in the lognormal t. To curve the Government
Response Index (GRI), we use the inverse CDF of a lognormal distribution with parameters                 µ   and   σ,   and
attribute a stringency to each country equal to the quantile corresponding to its empirical GRI CDF. We then
solve for the change in manufacturing output using the resulting labor supply shock, and target the average
change in IP across countries, and the range between the maximal and minimal change. The curving results
in a lognormal t with parameters            µ = −0.302   and   σ = 0.531.   It leaves the average stringency virtually
unchanged at   0.805   instead of   0.806,   but increases the dispersion.


B.3    Additional results


Country-level results        Tables A5 and A6 display the country-specic results of our baseline trade scenario
and our main renationalization counterfactual.


Reopening      Figure A2 displays the entire matrix of other countries (destination)' GDP changes when a
source country reopens.


B.4    Robustness


Fit of the linear approximation               Figure A3 assesses the t of the linear approximation used in the main
results by plotting the baseline changes in GDP against changes in GDP computed using exact hat algebra
following Dekle, Eaton, and Kortum (2008)'s procedure. The dots all lie close to the 45 degree line, implying
that the linear approximation is a good t.

baseline scenario, and for the renationalized scenario. Part 1.




Renationalization of intermediate supply chain only                   Figure A4 displays the dierence between the
baseline minus renationalization scenarios, using a dierent renationalization scenario where only intermediate
supply chains are renationalized, but countries can still trade in nal goods.         The dierence between the
intermediate renationalization scenario and the baseline is slightly muted, but the set of countries better

o under trade doesn't change except for countries where the dierence between trade and renationalized

instead of   30.1%   in our main renationalization scenario.

Sensitivity        This section presents the main results of the paper with dierent elasticities. Table A7 sum-
marizes the average declines in GDP in the baseline and under alternative elasticities. Figure A5 shows the
changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline and renationalized scenario, when the elasticity of sub-
stitution in consumption between manufacture, service, and health groups (ρ) is equal to                                            1.   Figure A6 shows
the changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline and renationalized scenario, when the intermediate
inputs elasticity (ε) is equal to                                           1.   Figure A7 shows the changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline
and renationalized scenario, when the elasticity of substitution in production across occupations (κ) is equal
to   0.2.   Figure A8 (A9) shows the changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline and renationalized
scenario, when the Frisch elasticity of labor supply (ψ ) is set to 1 (0.2). Figure A10 shows the changes in real
GDP and dierence between baseline and renationalized scenario, when the within-group Armington elasticity
(γ ) is equal to   0.5.   Finally, Figure A11 shows the changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline and
renationalized scenario, when the shock is calibrated using the raw stringency index without rescaling.

Overall, the numbers are very close to the baseline, except when the Frisch elasticity is lowered. In that case,
the drop in GDP and transmission are lower, as hours don't react as much. When the stringency index is not
rescaled to match the standard deviation in the data. In that case, the average GDP drop remains similar,

Notes: This table reports summary statistics of the results under alternative elasticities.    Each row represents a
robustness check where one elasticity has been changed.      The table reports cross-country mean changes in GDP
under trade (rst column) and renationalized supply chains (second column), the share of transmission under trade
(third column) and the dierence in GDP change between trade and renationalized scenario (last column).           In
parentheses under each mean is the standard deviation in that value across countries.

 Notes: The top panel of this gure displays the change in GDP following the labor supply shock described in Section
 3, when the elasticity of substitution between consumption groups   ρ   is set to 1. The rst bar represents the change
 in GDP under trade, decomposed into domestic shock (dark blue) and transmission (cream bar). The second bar
 represents the change in GDP under renationalization. The bottom panel decomposes the change in the reaction of

                   Dierence in GDP Change between Trade and Renationalized Equilibria


 Notes: The top panel of this gure displays the change in GDP following the labor supply shock described in Section
 3, when the intermediate input elasticity   ε   is equal to   1.   The rst bar represents the change in GDP under trade,
 decomposed into domestic shock (dark blue) and transmission (cream bar). The second bar represents the change in
 GDP under renationalization. The bottom panel decomposes the change in the reaction of GDP to the labor supply

 shock between the baseline trade economy (ln Vn ) and the renationalized supply chains economy (ln Vn ), according
 to the decomposition in equation (2.16). The purple is the total dierence, the cream bar is the transmission, the
 red bar is the change in domestic GE, and the light green bar is the change in domestic PE.

                   Dierence in GDP Change between Trade and Renationalized Equilibria


 Notes: The top panel of this gure displays the change in GDP following the labor supply shock described in Section
 3, when the elasticity of substitution between occupations   κ   is set to   0.2.   The rst bar represents the change in GDP
 under trade, decomposed into domestic shock (dark blue) and transmission (cream bar). The second bar represents
 the change in GDP under renationalization. The bottom panel decomposes the change in the reaction of GDP to
                                                                  T
 the labor supply shock between the baseline trade economy (ln Vn ) and the renationalized supply chains economy
      R
 (ln Vn ), according to the decomposition in equation (2.16). The purple is the total dierence, the cream bar is the
 transmission, the red bar is the change in domestic GE, and the light green bar is the change in domestic PE.

                   Dierence in GDP Change between Trade and Renationalized Equilibria


 Notes: The top panel of this gure displays the change in GDP following the labor supply shock described in Section
 3, when the Frisch elasticity of labor supply is set to 1. The rst bar represents the change in GDP under trade,
 decomposed into domestic shock (dark blue) and transmission (cream bar). The second bar represents the change in
 GDP under renationalization. The bottom panel decomposes the change in the reaction of GDP to the labor supply
                                               T                                                     R
 shock between the baseline trade economy (ln Vn ) and the renationalized supply chains economy (ln Vn ), according
 to the decomposition in equation (2.16). The purple is the total dierence, the cream bar is the transmission, the
 red bar is the change in domestic GE, and the light green bar is the change in domestic PE.

                        Dierence in GDP Change between Trade and Renationalized Equilibria


 Notes:        The top panel of this gure displays the change in GDP following the labor supply shock described in
 Section 3, when the within-group Armington elasticity    γ   is equal to   0.5.   The rst bar represents the change in GDP
 under trade, decomposed into domestic shock (dark blue) and transmission (cream bar). The second bar represents
 the change in GDP under renationalization. The bottom panel decomposes the change in the reaction of GDP to
                                                                  T
 the labor supply shock between the baseline trade economy (ln Vn ) and the renationalized supply chains economy
      R
 (ln Vn ), according to the decomposition in equation (2.16). The purple is the total dierence, the cream bar is the
 transmission, the red bar is the change in domestic GE, and the light green bar is the change in domestic PE.

                      Dierence in GDP Change between Trade and Renationalized Equilibria


 Notes: The top panel of this gure displays the change in GDP following the labor supply shock described in Section
 3, when using the unscaled stringency index. The rst bar represents the change in GDP under trade, decomposed
 into domestic shock (dark blue) and transmission (cream bar). The second bar represents the change in GDP under
 renationalization.   The bottom panel decomposes the change in the reaction of GDP to the labor supply shock
 between the baseline trade economy (ln V VnT ) and the renationalized supply chains economy (ln VnR ), according to
 the decomposition in equation (2.16). The purple is the total dierence, the cream bar is the transmission, the red
 bar is the change in domestic GE, and the light green bar is the change in domestic PE.
