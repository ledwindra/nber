The Stock Market and Bank Risk-Taking
Antonio Falato and David Scharfstein
NBER Working Paper No. 22689
September 2016
JEL No. G01,G2,G21
ABSTRACT
We present evidence that pressure to maximize short-term stock prices and earnings leads banks
to increase risk. We start by showing that banks increase risk when they transition from private to
public ownership through a public listing or an acquisition. The increase in risk is greater than for
a control group of banks that intended but failed to transition from private to public ownership, a
result that is robust to using a plausibly exogenous instrument for failed transitions. The increase
in risk is also greater than for a control group of banks that were acquired but did not change their
listing status. We establish that pressure to maximize short-term stock prices helps to explain
these findings by showing that the increase in risk is larger for newly public banks that are more
focused on short-term stock prices and performance.

1. Introduction
It is now well understood that risk taking by financial institutions is one of the main
causes of financial crises and severe recessions (Jorda, Schularick and Taylor, 2013). Yet, we
know relatively little about what gives rise to such risk-taking in the first place. Some have tied
the problem to management compensation, which is often structured so that managers benefit
from good performance but bear only a small share of the costs of bad performance (Bolton,
Mehran and Shapiro, 2010; and Bebchuk, Cohen and Spamann, 2010). Others have argued that
explicit or implicit government guarantees of bank debt enable banks to take risks without
bearing their full social costs (Kane, 1985; Pennacchi, 1987; and Farhi and Tirole, 2012). Yet
others have suggested that behavioral biases lead financial firms to neglect the risk of adverse
tail outcomes (Gennaioli, Shleifer and Vishny, 2012).
In this paper, we put forth and empirically examine another explanation – namely that a
focus on short-term stock prices rather than long-run value induces financial institutions to
increase the risk they take. This view is motivated in part by the observation that the growth of
the U.S. banking sector over the past 25 or so years was concentrated among publicly-traded
banks, as can be seen in Figure 1.
Our explanation is based on the "short-termism" model of Stein (1989), which shows that
when firms place weight on short-term stock prices they have incentives to take difficult-toobserve actions that boost current earnings at the expense of long-run profitability. Stock market
investors rationally attribute higher current earnings in part to better long-run fundamentals and
value, which in turn, creates incentives for firms to pump up short-term earnings. This type of
reasoning has often been used to argue that the stock market induces firms to take less risk
because long-term risky projects like R&D lower short-run profitability. But in banking, the
	  
	  

	  

easiest way to increase short-run profitability is to take more risk. For example, banks can loosen
lending standards, leading them to make more loans with higher yields but also higher default
rates. And they can use more short-term funding, thereby lowering current funding costs but
increasing rollover and run risk.
To examine the effect of the stock market on bank risk-taking we estimate the change in a
bank’s risk when it transitions from private ownership to public stock market ownership. These
transitions occur either when a privately held bank goes public through an initial public offering
(IPO) or when it is acquired by a publicly-traded bank holding company (BHC). We are able to
track a bank following its acquisition because acquired banks often remain legally distinct
companies that still must submit their own regulatory filings and undergo their own supervisory
reviews.
We start by presenting evidence that after banks make this transition they experience a
decline in their confidential safety and soundness ratings as assessed by bank supervisors. The
supervisory ratings include the six so-called "component" ratings (Capital Adequacy, Asset
Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to Market Risk), a "composite"
CAMELS rating based on the component ratings, and a loan-level risk rating from the Federal
Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL). In addition, we document that after a
transition to public ownership there is an increase in risk as measured by a decline in capital
ratios, a shift to riskier activities, and a greater reliance on short-term funding, among other
measures of risk.
While this evidence is consistent with stock market pressure leading to an increase in
risk, it is difficult to interpret this empirical relationship as being causal; the factors that give rise

2

	  

	  

to the IPO or acquisition in the first instance could be correlated with a change in the
environment that increases risk or the incentive to take risk. For example, an IPO might come in
response to growth opportunities associated with population and business expansions that
increase the demand for residential and commercial mortgages. But these growth opportunities
could also be associated with a riskier economic environment.
To address this identification challenge, we use a difference-in-differences (DD)
approach that compares the change in risk of banks that switch ownership status (the treatment
group) to a set of banks that intended to go public or be acquired but did not because their deals
were cancelled (the control group). The idea here – following Seru (2014) and Bernstein (2014)
in their work on innovation – is to compare the change in risk of banks in the treatment group to
a set of banks in the control group whose decisions were likely driven by the same factors. For
example, if the intention to go public is correlated with an expansion of growth opportunities and
increase in risk, then the comparison with banks that intended to go public but did not end up
doing so should alleviate the concern that the treatment group is facing a substantially different
environment than the control group. Using this estimation strategy, we find a significant
deterioration in the CAMELS, loan risk ratings, and financial risk measures of treated banks
relative to the control group of banks with cancelled IPOs or acquisitions. Moreover, there are no
significant differences in pre-treatment trends in CAMELS ratings and treated and control banks
appear to be well-balanced along key pre-treatment covariates that may affect risk. Finally, the
subsequent performance of treated banks is consistent with an increase in risk-taking: their return
on equity initially rises relative to control banks, but then falls, and treated banks also perform
worse during the financial crisis of 2007-2009.

3

	  

	  

While this approach goes some distance in dealing with endogeneity concerns, it is
possible that deal cancellations are correlated with factors related to bank risk. Therefore, we
follow Bernstein (2014) by instrumenting for deal completion with an index of stock returns in
the two months after the deal is announced. Deals are more likely to be cancelled when banking
industry stock returns are low in this two-month window. Under the assumption that banking
industry stock returns over this short window are uncorrelated with longer-term, bank-specific
risk-taking incentives, the predicted value of this first-stage regression should be purged of the
component of deal failure that could be correlated with risk-taking incentives. Indeed, we find
that the results are robust to this instrumental variables approach.
To examine the causal interpretation further, we also use a different control group for the
treated banks, comprised of successful mergers in which there was no change in public/private
status. In particular, we find that when a private bank is acquired by another private bank or
when a public bank is acquired by another public bank there is no deterioration in CAMELS or
loan risk ratings, nor is there an increase in financial risk measures. Risk only increases when a
private bank is acquired by a public bank.
While the results described above suggest that the transition from private to public
ownership causes an increase in risk, there are a number of possible explanations of this
behavior. One such explanation, based on the rational short-termism model of Stein (1989), was
suggested above: banks increase risk to pump up short-term earnings and thereby increase
market perceptions of their long-run value. A related explanation has a more behavioral twist:
the stock market may over-extrapolate higher earnings into the future, underweighting the role
that risk plays in raising short-term earnings as well as the mean reversion in earnings that could
follow. Such an interpretation would be consistent with the evidence in La Porta (1996) and
4

	  

	  

other studies documenting that stock analysts tend to place too much weight on past earnings
growth in forecasting future earnings growth. In this case, banks would also have an incentive to
increase risk as a way of increasing short-term earnings and thus the short-term stock price.
An even simpler explanation is that banks increase risk not because they want to increase
short-term stock prices but because the transition to public ownership shifts ownership from
undiversified owner-managers to a broad base of diversified shareholders who can bear more
risk. It is also possible that banks increase risk because public ownership makes it easier for them
to raise additional equity capital, allowing them to more easily weather adverse shocks
associated with greater risk-taking.
While we cannot rule out the possibility that greater shareholder diversification and
reduced costs of equity financing may help to explain our baseline findings, we present evidence
that the effects we have identified are stronger among banks that are likely to be more concerned
with short-term stock prices. This finer cross-sectional evidence is broadly supportive of a shorttermism interpretation, whether the rational limited-information version or the more behavioral
perspective discussed above.
To establish the relevance of short-termism, we show first that our risk measures increase
more if the bank has a smaller board, fewer insider board members, and better governance
according to the measure developed by Gompers, Ishii and Metrick (2003). Thus, the more banks
are focused on the stock price, the more risk they take. Second, we find a greater increase in risk
for banks owned by institutional investors that turn over their shares more rapidly and by CEOs
that trade more actively in the bank’s stock. These findings are consistent with the implication
that banks that are more focused on short-term stock prices should increase risk more. Third, we

5

	  

	  

document that the increase in risk is larger for banks that mention the phrase “short-term” more
frequently in their quarterly earnings calls, behavior that has elsewhere been shown to be
associated with a focus on short-term earnings management (Brochet, Loumioti, and Serafeim,
2015). Finally, we show that the increase in risk is greater at times when there is more downward
pressure on earnings – during periods of low interest rates and low credit spreads.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and
presents the basic finding that banks increase risk when they go public or are acquired by a
publicly traded BHC. Section 3 then attempts to establish that this is a causal relationship
through our DD approach. Section 4 introduces cross-sectional evidence in an attempt to better
understand the mechanism underlying our findings. Section 5 concludes.

2. Data and Descriptive Evidence
To construct the sample, we start with the universe of U.S. commercial banks that are
held by a bank holding company (BHC) and have non-missing information on total assets as
reported to regulators in the Reports of Condition and Income (“Call Reports”) between 1990
and 2012. This yields a starting panel of 220,194 commercial bank-quarter observations for
8,314 (3,511) unique commercial banks (BHCs).

2.1. Information on Bank Risk-Taking
Our first main type of risk measure is based on confidential supervisory information from
the National Information Center (NIC) of the Federal Reserve System. The NIC dataset covers
all on-site examinations of safety and soundness conducted by banking regulators, whose main
outcome is six "component" ratings – Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings,
6

	  

	  

Liquidity, and Sensitivity to Market Risk – and an overall "composite" CAMELS rating. Each of
these ratings ranges between a value of 1 and 5, with the risk profile and risk-management
practices of banks rated 1 or 2 considered "strong" and those rated 3, 4, or 5 considered "weak."
An advantage of having individual component ratings is that we can measure bank risk-taking
along several dimensions. In addition, the supervisory ratings also capture an ex-ante aspect of
bank risk-taking in that they account for not only the current risk profile of the bank, but also the
ability of management to identify, measure, monitor and control the six types of risks that are
rated.
We complement these data with confidential information on loan-level risk from the
Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL), which is available for the 1997
to 2012 period.1 (See Berger, Kashyap, and Scalise (1995) for an early study that uses STBL.)
The survey asks participating banks about the terms of all commercial and industrial loans issued
during the first full business week of the middle month in every quarter. Banks report the risk
rating of each loan by mapping their internal loan risk ratings to a scale defined by the Federal
Reserve. Loan risk ratings vary from 1 to 5, with 5 representing the highest risk.
In addition to supervisory risk data, we use Call Reports to construct a set of risk
measures based on the level of bank capital, the composition of asset portfolios, the maturity
structure of bank liabilities, and the sources of bank income. The definitions of the variables used
in the analysis are in the Appendix.

The STBL is a quarterly survey on the terms of business lending of a stratified sample of about 400
banks conducted by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which typically covers a very large share of assets in the
U.S. banking sector. For example, the combined assets of the banks responding to the survey for the
fourth quarter of 2011 represented about 60 percent of all assets of U.S. commercial banks.

2.2. Information on Private-to-Public Transitions
To construct our sample of private-to-public transitions, we use the NIC data and several
other standard sources of historical information on BHC stock listing status. From the NIC data,
we retrieve the full history of top-tier bank holding companies of each commercial bank. We
determine whether a BHC is publicly traded using historical stock market listing information
from the New York Fed CRSP-FRB link database, as well as data on all IPO filings of financial
firms (SIC codes between 6000 and 6999) from Thomson Financial’s SDC New Issues database,
Capital IQ Key Developments database, and SNL Financial Capital Offerings database. This
process leads to a final merged BHC-commercial bank sample running from 1990-2012 of
178,980 commercial bank-quarter observations for 7,166 (3,251) unique commercial banks
(BHCs) whose historical stock listing status we are able to confirm.
The sample of private-to-public transitions used in the analysis – which we refer to as the
“Switchers” sub-sample – is comprised of all commercial banks that are in the final merged
BHC-commercial bank sample and experience a private-to-public transition sometime during the
1990-2012 period. Private-to-public transitions occur in one of two ways: either a privately-held
bank completes an initial public offering (IPO) or a privately held bank is acquired by a publiclytraded bank holding company (BHC). To identify the transitions due to IPOs, we find all the
completed IPOs from the three sources detailed above. We identify transitions due to
acquisitions using the Merger Table from the NIC data, which keeps a full historical record of
dates and identities of target and acquirer banks. We are able to track the ratings of a commercial
bank after it has been acquired because acquired banks often remain legally distinct companies
that must still submit their own regulatory filings and thus retain their identifiers. The Switchers
sub-sample consists of 1,294 (758) commercial banks (BHCs) that underwent a private-to-public
transition sometime during the 1990-2012 period, yielding 26,776 commercial bank-quarter
8

	  

	  

observations. Of these transitions, 406 (206) are commercial banks (BHCs) that completed an
IPO, resulting in 15,411 commercial bank-quarter observations. This sample excludes
acquisitions of failed banks that were under FDIC receivership or had a CAMELS rating of 5 at
the time of the acquisition.
Finally, we also construct a sub-sample of private-to-public transitions that were
attempted but failed either because the IPO filing was withdrawn or the acquisition was not
completed. This sub-sample serves as the control group in our baseline identification strategy.
After submitting an initial registration statement to the SEC (usually Form S-1) to announce their
intention to go public, filers have the option to withdraw the IPO filing by submitting the SEC’s
Form RW during the IPO marketing period (the “book-building" phase). Potential acquirers also
typically announce their intention to bid for a target, which can be followed by an announcement
to withdraw the bid. To identify withdrawn IPOs, we flag the filings that are classified as
withdrawn from the lists of all IPO filings contained in the three sources detailed above. To
identify withdrawn acquisitions, we use all acquisitions filings of financial firms that are
classified as not completed from other data sources, which include Thomson-Financial’s SDC
M&A database, Capital IQ Key Developments database, and SNL Financial Mergers and
Acquisitions database. Filing withdrawals are common both in IPO and M&A markets, as
approximately 15 percent of all IPO and M&A announcements of financial firms are ultimately
not completed. This figure is in line with the 20 percent IPO withdrawal rate reported by
Bernstein (2014) in his study of R&D-intensive firms. The control group consists of 227 (176)
commercial banks (BHCs) that either withdrew their IPO application or were the target of a
withdrawn private-to-public acquisition attempt, yielding 4,793 commercial bank-quarter
observations.

2.3. Descriptive Statistics and Suggestive Evidence
Table 1 presents summary statistics of our main sample. Banks in the Switchers subsample tend to be smaller and have somewhat riskier supervisory ratings relative to other banks
in the full sample. In Table 2, we provide evidence of a statistical relationship between
ownership status of the BHC (public or private) and the supervisory risk variables, as well as the
risk measures based on Call Report data. Specifically, in Panels A and B we report results of
pooled (Panel A) and firm fixed effects (Panels B) regressions, with each of the eight supervisory
ratings as the dependent variable in the ten-year period (1997-2006) leading up to the financial
crisis of 2007-2009. We also report results for two alternative scores that are constructed by
aggregating across the ratings – the Overall Quality Score (Column 9), which is measured as the
riskiest of the individual ratings, and the Bad Rating Dummy (Column 10), which takes the value
one if the bank is rated weak (3 or higher) in any of the individual ratings. The explanatory
variables are a dummy variable that equals one for commercial banks that are held by a publiclytraded BHC, bank size (total assets of the commercial bank), and year-quarter fixed effects. We
also include a fixed effect for the regulatory agency that performs the supervisory assessments
since this agency may change after a bank transitions to public ownership, as discussed in greater
detail in Section 3.5 below.
Across the full set of ratings, the coefficient of the publicly-traded BHC variable is
positive and strongly statistically significant, indicating that publicly-traded banks score
consistently worse across all supervisory ratings. In Panel C, we report the results of the same
fixed-effect regressions except that the dependent variables in these regressions are risk measures
based on Call Report data. These regressions all indicate an increase in risk after a bank
transitions to publicly-traded status. For example, the first column shows that the Tier 1 capital
declines after the transition and the second column shows that risk-weighted assets increase.
10

	  

	  

Other variables measuring risk on the asset and liabilities side of the balance sheet all show an
increase in risk. The last column in Panel C reports the results of a regression in which the
dependent variable is “Risk Factor,” which is a linear combination of the risk measures based on
Call Report data, with weights calculated using principal component analysis. This regression
shows an increase in Risk Factor after a bank transitions to publicly-traded status.
These findings differ from a number of cross-sectional studies (Kwan, 2004 and Nichols,
Wahlen and Wieland, 2009), which do not find statistically significant differences in risk across
ownership status, especially after controlling for size. These studies may not find an effect
because they use proxies for risk that are based on measures of ex-post operating performance,
such as non-performing loans or volatility of operating performance. This approach has limited
power in normal times as we discuss in greater detail below and demonstrate in Table 10.2 By
focusing on ex ante measures of risk and on changes in ownership status, we are able to
document a difference in risk in normal times.

3. Identifying the Effect of the Stock Market on Bank Risk-Taking
One concern with the descriptive evidence in Table 2 is that the private-to-public
transition could be endogenous and correlated with bank risk. For example, an IPO might come
in response to growth opportunities such as population and business expansions that increase the

	  Other papers have shown that banks increase risk when they convert from a mutual form of organization
to stock ownership (Esty, 1997; Schrand and Unal, 1998). These papers interpret the finding as evidence
that shareholders have incentives to increase risk when they get all of the benefits on the upside but bear
only a part of the losses on the downside. Since the conversion is often also associated with an initial
public offering of stock, it is possible that the stock market pressure hypothesis we have advanced here
might also be part of the explanation.
	  

11

	  

	  

demand for residential and commercial mortgages. If these same growth opportunities also
increase bank risk, then the estimates would not have a causal interpretation.
3.1. Empirical Framework
To address this identification challenge, we use a difference-in-differences (DD)
approach that compares the change in risk of banks that switch ownership status (the treatment
group) to the change in risk of a set of banks that intended to go public or be acquired but whose
deals were cancelled (the control group). The idea here – following Seru (2014) and Bernstein
(2014) in their work on innovation – is that we are comparing the change in risk of banks in the
treatment group to a set of banks whose private-to-public transition decisions were plausibly
driven by the same factors. For example, the intention to go public could be correlated with an
increase in the demand for residential and commercial mortgages if banks seek capital to fund
these mortgages. However, the increased demand for credit could, in principle, be associated
with an increase in the risk of the bank’s existing portfolio. Comparing within-bank changes in
risk of treated banks to those of relatively similar banks in the control group should help to
alleviate selection concerns such as these. Of course, it is important that the reason that the deal
is withdrawn is not correlated with a change in the bank’s risk environment, an issue we take up
in Section 3.4 below.
More formally, to examine the effect of private-to-public transitions on bank risk-taking,
we use the following baseline DD regression specification:
                      𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾!" = 𝛼 + 𝛽! ×𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟!" + 𝛽! ×𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟!" ×𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡! + 𝛾×𝑍!" + 𝜇! + 𝜇! + 𝜀!"                         (1)

where i and t index commercial banks and year-quarters. RISK is measured by the variety of
supervisory ratings and financial information. After is an indicator variable that takes a value of

12

	  

	  

one for all the bank-quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise, and Treatment is
an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and
zero for those in the control group. Zit controls for bank-level covariates of risk and, in the
baseline specification, is measured as bank size (total assets), while 𝜇! and 𝜇! are year-quarter
dummies and commercial bank fixed effects, respectively. The inclusion of bank size, as well as
bank and time fixed effects means that our estimates compare the (within-bank) response of risk
measures for treated banks to that of similarly-sized control banks in the same year-quarter. We
evaluate statistical significance using robust clustered standard errors adjusted for nonindependence of observations within BHCs.3 In order to better focus on the build-up of risk precrisis, in all our baseline tests we examine a ten-year window running up to the crisis (19972006). The focus on the pre-crisis period helps to ease the potential concern that changes in
supervisory standards after the crisis may be driving our results. The null hypothesis is that the
coefficient of interest, 𝛽! , which captures the effect of changes in stock listing status on bank
risk, is equal to zero.
Before reporting our baseline findings for the DD estimation, we present comparisons of
the treatment and control groups prior to the intended private-to-public transitions. Table 3,
Panel A shows that the only difference between treatment and control groups is size, with banks
in the treatment group larger than those in the control group (a log difference of 31.5%). But
other balance sheet ratios including the Tier 1 capital ratio, deposits to assets, and loans to assets
are essentially the same across the two groups. Importantly, there is no difference in the average
CAMELS ratings and the year-to-year change in CAMELS ratings in the pre-transition period.
Panel B looks at differences in the treatment and control groups in a multivariate regression

setting. We report estimates from linear-probability regression analysis of the likelihood that an
IPO or private-to-public M&A deal is successfully completed for three different specifications:
one that includes the full set of baseline controls in the year prior to the announcement (Column
1); one that adds the composite CAMELS rating in the year prior to the announcement (Column
2); and one that also adds the annual change of the composite CAMELS ratings in each of the
two years prior to the treatment (Column 3). Pre-announcement balance sheet variables,
CAMELS ratings and changes in CAMELS rating are not statistically significant in these
regressions.
3.2. Baseline DD Estimates
Table 4 reports results from estimating our baseline DD regression (1) for each of the
supervisory risk ratings (Panel A) and for the risk measures based on financial information
(Panel B). For each of the supervisory risk rating measures in Panel A, the estimates indicate that
after a private-to-public transition there is a deterioration in a bank’s supervisory ratings relative
to a similarly-sized bank that attempts but does not complete a transition.
The results in Panel B indicate that the transition to public ownership leads to riskier
bank behavior across numerous financial measures. Among other things, banks reduce their Tier
1 capital ratio, shorten the maturity of their liabilities, and increase reliance on more volatile
sources of funding. Furthermore, Panel B indicates that banks grow their risk-weighted assets
after they transition to public ownership. The fact that they do not also grow their total assets
(see Appendix Table A.1), suggests that they move their portfolios into riskier asset classes after
the transition.
There are a few ways to help gauge the economic significance of our estimates. Our first
approach is to examine how a private-to-public transition moves a bank in the empirical
14

	  

	  

distribution of the CAMELS rating. Since our DD specification includes bank fixed effects, we
use the within-bank distribution (i.e., the distribution after removing bank fixed effects) as the
benchmark. The estimated 0.224 increase in CAMELS following a transition is a sizable effect
that corresponds to a full quartile of the conditional distribution of the rating. A second approach
is to compare the effect of a private-to-public transition to that of bank size. We calculate these
marginal effects by multiplying the respective estimates by the within-firm standard deviation of
bank size. The marginal impact of a private-to-public transition is substantially larger than the
effect of a large, two-standard deviation change in the effect of bank size (0.013*1.88=0.024) on
the composite CAMELS rating.
While the effect is somewhat stronger for the composite CAMELS and the STBL loan
risk ratings, the effects are still sizable across component ratings, including the management,
asset, capital, and earnings quality categories. Depending on the rating, the magnitude of the
implied effect of a private-to-public transition ranges between about 1/3 and 1/2 of a one
standard deviation movement in the within-bank distribution. These effects are similar in size to
the effect of the Bad Rating Dummy, which takes the value one if any of the component ratings
are weak (3 or higher). Thus, the effect of transitioning to public status is not just that it moves
banks from being very safe (rating of 1) to somewhat less safe (rating of 2), but it meaningfully
increases the likelihood that the bank has a weak component rating.
Furthermore, the estimates for the financial risk measures are roughly comparable in
magnitude to those for the supervisory ratings. For example, the estimated 0.096 increase in the
Risk Factor following a transition (Column 10 of Panel B) also corresponds to about a full
quartile move in the conditional distribution of the factor. The marginal impact of a private-to-

15

	  

	  

public transition on the Risk Factor is also much larger than the effect of a large, two-standard
deviation change in the effect of bank size (0.019*1.88=0.036).
Our baseline estimates for the supervisory ratings are little changed if we match to the
control group of banks based on the time at which the transition announcement occurs and on
(pre-treatment) size. (See Appendix Table A.2.) This matched-sample DD approach (Heckman,
Ichimura, and Todd, 1997) addresses the potential concern that our linear controls for size in the
DD analysis may not fully capture non-linear relationships between size and the outcomes of
interest.4
Figure 2, Panel A shows results of a graphical analysis in which we plot a dummy for bad
composite CAMELS (3 or higher) in event time leading up to and after the year when a bank
announces a private-to-public transition. In line with our baseline estimates, there is a sharp
increase in the likelihood that a treated bank receives a bad CAMELS rating beginning right after
the announcement (t=+1), but there is no change for banks in the control group. The likelihood
that a treated bank receives a bad CAMELS ratings continues to increase in the subsequent years
(t = +2 to t=+4). In line with the evidence presented in Table 2, there are no meaningful trends in
this variable in years prior to announcement (t=-1 to t=-5) and little difference in the levels for
the treated and control banks during the pre-treatment period. Panel B of Figure 2 shows a
similar pattern for the Risk Factor: no pre-treatment trends or differences in the likelihood of a
high value of the Risk Factor for treated and control banks before a transition, and an increase in
this likelihood of a transition only for the treated banks.

3.3. Robustness to Using an Alternative Control Group
Next, we estimate specification (1) using an alternative control group of mergers that are
successful but do not lead to a change in public/private status because they involve either a
private bank that is acquired by another private bank or a public bank that is acquired by another
public bank. Since this control group is comprised only of M&A deals, we limit the treatment
group to acquisitions of a private bank by a public bank, thereby excluding IPOs. Bloom, Sadun,
and Van Reenen (2012) use a similar approach to estimate the productivity effect of transferring
ownership to a U.S. multinational. In using this control group, we are making the identifying
assumption that while an acquisition could select for banks facing an increase in the risk
environment, this increase does not depend on the type of ownership change (i.e., private to
public, private to private, public to public). The resulting sample consists of up to 14,479
commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs and 788 unique commercial
banks in the run-up to the crisis period between 1997 and 2006.
As in our baseline DD estimation, we check to see whether there are any significant
differences in the treatment and control groups before the acquisition. Table 5, Panel A shows
that the only statistically significant difference in balance sheet variables between the two groups
is size, with the treatment group being somewhat smaller (a log difference of about 19%).
Moreover, CAMELS and the change in the CAMELS pre-acquisition are the same across the
two groups. The similarity of the two groups is also evident in Panel B, which reports estimates
of a linear-probability regression analysis of the likelihood that a bank becomes the target of a
private-to-public acquisition bid as compared to other types of acquisitions. We examine three
different specifications: one that includes the full set of prior-year baseline controls (Column 1);
one that adds the year-prior composite CAMELS rating (Column 2); and one that also adds the

17

	  

	  

changes in the composite CAMELS rating in each of the two years prior to the acquisition
(Column 3). There are no statistically significant coefficients, indicating that there are no balance
sheet differences across the two groups, nor are there differences in pre-acquisition CAMELS
and trends in CAMELS.
DD estimates using this alternative control group are reported in Table 6. Panel A shows
results for each of the supervisory ratings and Panel B shows results for the financial measures of
risk. In line with our baseline results, the estimates indicate that there is a deterioration in
CAMELS and loan risk ratings, as well as an increase in financial risk measures when private
banks are acquired by public banks, but not for other acquisitions where public/private status is
unchanged. For example, the estimates in Column 7, Panel A show that there is an increase in the
composite CAMELS rating of 0.095, which is smaller than the baseline estimate of 0.224 and
corresponds to about a one third standard deviation move in the (within-bank) distribution of the
combined CAMELS rating. Overall, our DD estimates are stable across different control groups,
suggesting that our findings are not simply an artifact of a particular choice of control group.
3.4. Robustness to Using a 2SLS-IV Estimator
We now address the potential concern that deal cancellations (used in our baseline DD
estimation) could be correlated with factors related to bank risk, thus leading to a selection bias
in the estimates. We follow the approach of Bernstein (2014), which instruments for deal
completion with an index of stock returns in the two months after the deal is announced. Under
the assumption that stock returns over this short window are uncorrelated with longer-term risktaking incentives, the predicted value of this first-stage regression should be purged of the
component of deal failure that could be correlated with changes in the risk environment.
Specifically, we estimate the following 2SLS-IV specification:
18

	  

	  

𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾!!"#$ = 𝛼 + 𝛽! 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑙! + 𝛾! 𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾!!"# + 𝛾! 𝑍! + 𝜇! + 𝜀!                                               (2)
where RISKiPost is the average bank risk proxy in the quarters after the announcement date,
RISKiPre is the corresponding average in the quarters prior to the announcement, and
𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑙 is a predicted probability that a private-to-public transaction occurs. This
predicted probability is estimated from the (first-stage) regression,
        𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑙! = 𝛼! + 𝛽! 𝑆&𝑃𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘  𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠! + 𝛾! 𝑍! + 𝜇! + 𝜀!                                                                   (3)
where we are using the S&P Bank Index returns in the two months following each
announcement as the instrument.
Table 7 shows that the instrument has predictive power in the first stage and does not
appear to be selecting on observables. As shown in Table 7, deals announced when the bank
stock index performs poorly are less likely to be completed. This is evident in Panel A, where we
show that deals are less likely to be completed when index returns are in the bottom quartile
rather than the top quartile. It is also evident in Panel B, where we report various versions of the
first stage of our 2SLS-IV analysis. Panel A also shows that other bank characteristics appear to
be unrelated to index stock returns, so there is no indication that our instrument is selecting on
observables.
Table 8 reports the 2SLS-IV estimates for each of the supervisory ratings (Panel A), and
each of the financial risk measures (Panel B). After instrumenting with stock returns, transitions
to public listing status continue to be associated with a significant deterioration in banks'
supervisory ratings and to a significant increase in financial risk measures.5 The estimated stock
market impact remains sizable across all supervisory ratings and all financial risk measures.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
5
For example, the estimates in Column 7, Panel A show that there is an increase in the composite
CAMELS rating of 0.303, which is economically significant and somewhat larger than our baseline DD
estimates in Table 4.
19

	  

	  

It is reassuring about the validity of the instrument that if we measure the instrument over
different time windows (after the transition, a year before the announcement, or a year after the
announcement) it does not predict the composite CAMELS ratings in the years after the
announcement. Since bank index stock returns over these different time windows do not affect
the likelihood that the transition occurs, the evidence from this placebo test corroborates the
exclusion restriction that the instrument affects bank risk only through its impact on the outcome
of the ownership transitions. (See Appendix Table A.3.)
3.5 Addressing Other Endogeneity Issues: Attrition and Supervision
Another issue we need to address is whether our results are in some way biased by the
fact that we can only track a bank’s risk after an acquisition (but not an IPO) if it remains a
separate subsidiary of the acquiring BHC. About 2/3 of acquired banks are not merged into
another bank subsidiary of the acquiring BHC at the time (within one quarter) of acquisition and
by two (three) years after the acquisition, 50% (47%) of the acquired banks are not merged into a
subsidiary of the acquiring BHC. A potential selection concern with our findings is that an
acquiring BHC only chooses to merge an acquired bank into one of its subsidiaries if the risk of
the acquired bank did not increase after the acquisition, leaving us with observations only on the
banks that increased risk.
We think that this selection concern is unlikely to explain our findings for three reasons.
First, there are no observable differences in the banks that are absorbed into a subsidiary bank
and those that are not, including the risk level of the bank prior to the acquisition. (See Appendix
Table A.4.) Second, as we showed in Section 3.3 above, the results are robust to using as a
control group mergers where public-private status did not change. In order for attrition to explain
our results, it would have to be the case that public BHC acquirers of private banks have a
20

	  

	  

greater propensity to merge risky targets into their subsidiaries than do private BHC acquirers or
public BHC acquirers of other public BHCs. Finally, the results are robust to excluding all
mergers and focusing only on IPOs. (See Appendix Table A.5.) In this case, we can track the
bank without concern that there are post-treatment endogenous mergers.
Another concern is that switching to public status could change the bank’s supervisor
from one regulator to another. If the supervisors that tend to regulate public BHCs are more
rigorous in their assessments, then we would be more likely to see an increase in risk even if the
bank’s behavior does not change. We first note, however, that this would not explain the increase
in risk measured from Call Reports. In fact, one would expect that if the new supervisors were
more rigorous in their assessments – or if continuing supervisors became more rigorous – then
these financial risk measures would decline. But we see these risk measures actually increase.
More directly, there is no evidence that a transition to public status triggers a change of the
regulator that supervises the bank (Appendix Table A.6, Panel A). Even then, if there are new
supervisors, we note that we have controlled for the effects of new supervisors by including fixed
effects for the regulatory agency that provides the supervisory assessments in all the
specifications that involve the CAMELS ratings.
3.6. Evidence on Bank Performance
If, as we show, treatment banks take greater risk once they transition to public ownership,
their performance should initially improve, but they should experience an increased likelihood of
poor subsequent performance. Table 9 tracks the change in the quarterly return on equity (ROE)
and quarterly return on assets (ROA) in the quarters after the transition relative to the quarter
prior to the transition. These changes for the transitioning banks net out the changes in quarterly
ROE and ROA of control banks that announced a transition that was later not completed. Note
21

	  

	  

that the annual ROE – the typical ROE number that is calculated for banks – would be roughly
four times the numbers reported in the table.
Table 9 shows that by six quarters after the transition, quarterly ROE is 90 basis points
higher than it was prior to the transition for the treated banks relative to the control banks, but by
three years after the transition quarterly ROE is 60 basis points below the pre-transition level,
and by four years it is 110 basis points below the pre-transition level. Given a mean quarterly
ROE of 2.9% and a cross-sectional standard deviation of 2.8%, these are sizable effects; the
initial boost in performance is about one-third of a standard deviation and the decline in
performance four years out is close to 40% of a standard deviation. A similar pattern exists for
quarterly ROA.
Another implication of our findings is that if treatment banks take greater risk in the ten
years prior to the financial crisis they should perform more poorly during the crisis across a
variety of measures including ROE and ROA, and they should have more non-performing loans
and greater loan loss provisions during the crisis. To examine this prediction, we conduct a DD
analysis with these and other measures of bank operating performance as the dependent variable
and with cancelled deals as the control group. We add to our baseline specification an interaction
of the crisis dummy with the treatment effect (i.e., Treatment x After x Crisis), which allows us
to test whether there was greater underperformance of the treated banks relative to control banks
during the crisis.6 The results are reported in Panel A of Table 10. To facilitate comparison,
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
6
Note that we are excluding Crisis and the interactions Treatment x Crisis and After x Crisis. Crisis is
excluded because it is collinear with the time dummies. After x Crisis is excluded because it is collinear
with Crisis given that After is always one when Crisis is one (as we are excluding the small number of
transitions that occur during the crisis to alleviate concerns about mechanical correlation between
transitions and performance in the crisis). This implies that Treatment x Crisis is also collinear with
Treatment x After x Crisis.
22

	  

	  

Panel B reports results without the interaction term. The estimates indicate that newly listed and
acquired treatment banks significantly underperformed during the crisis, a result that holds along
all the measures of performance considered. There is no evidence that banks that transition to
public share ownership underperform in normal times.

4. Cross-Sectional and Time-Series Evidence
We have interpreted the results as evidence that banks try to pump up short-term earnings
to influence market perceptions of their long-run value as would be implied by the short-termism
model of Stein (1989) or a related behavioral story in which investors over-extrapolate earnings
growth. However, there are other potential explanations of our findings. One simple explanation
is that after banks transition to public ownership their shares are held by more diversified
investors who are in a better position to bear risk. Another possibility is that publicly-traded
banks can raise capital more easily and more cheaply than privately-owned banks after an
adverse shock. In this view, the lower costs of external finance for publicly-traded banks makes
them more willing to take risk.
We cannot rule out these explanations, but we can explore whether there is evidence that
is consistent with our short-termism interpretation. Thus, we explore whether the risk-taking
effects that we have identified are stronger among banks that are likely to be more focused on the
short-term stock price.
To examine the finer implications of the short-termism story, we start by adding to the
baseline DD specification (1) an interaction term of the treatment effect with standard measures
of corporate governance, which include board size, the percentage of insider board members, and
the number of anti-takeover provisions based on the index developed by Gompers, Ishii and
23

	  

	  

Metrick (2003), which we refer to as GIM. These variables arguably all measure the extent to
which the firm is insulated from takeovers, thereby reducing the extent to which they care about
the short-run stock price. We expect that banks that score worse on these governance measures
(larger board size, more insiders on the board, and more anti-takeover provisions) would take
less risk after they transition to public ownership. Note that we do not observe these variables for
the banks that do not transition to public ownership so we set their values to zero. By taking this
approach we are able to examine whether the effect of the transition to public ownership is
stronger for banks that are less insulated from the stock market.
Table 11, Panels A and B report estimates from this triple-DD specification for the
composite CAMELS rating (Panel A) and our Risk Factor measure. As predicted, the results
indicate that the composite CAMELS rating deteriorates less and there is a decline in the Risk
Factor relative to control banks if the bank has a larger board, more insider board members, and
worse governance according to the GIM measure. Thus, insulation from stock-market pressure
leads to less risk-taking.
Panels C and D of Table 11 present another set of variables, those that measure the extent
to which shareholders and managers have short investment horizons. The results indicate that the
risk-taking effects are more pronounced for banks that are held by institutional shareholders and
CEOs that turn over their shares more frequently.7 Moreover, the risk-taking effects are larger
when bank executives more frequently use the phrase “short-term” in earnings calls, which
Brochet, Loumioti and Serafeim (2015) show is related to accounting choices such as
discretionary accruals, which tend to increase short-term earnings. Thus, the collection of
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
7

Gaspar, Massa and Matos (2005) show that firms with high institutional share turnover are more likely to receive a
takeover bid. Thus, the effect measured in Panel C could be related to the results in Panel B linking risk-taking to
governance variables that affect the likelihood of a takeover.

24

	  

	  

evidence we present here suggests that the risk-taking effects are larger when short-term stock
prices are of greater concern to bank managers.
Panels E and F of Table 11 look at time-series variation in the treatment effect. In
particular, we examine whether risk-taking incentives of publicly-held banks are increased
relative to privately-held banks at times when there is more downward pressure on bank
earnings, i.e. when interest rates are low (as measured by the Fed funds rate) and when credit
spreads are tight (as measured by the spread of yields on long-term investment-grade corporate
bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasuries and the spread of A2/P2 overnight
commercial paper rates over AA overnight commercial paper rates, respectively). These panels
show that supervisory ratings deteriorate more and financial risk measures increase more during
periods when the Fed funds rate and credit spreads are low. The findings are consistent with the
work of Hanson and Stein (2015) showing that commercial banks increase the duration of the
securities holdings when short-term rates are low presumably in an effort to increase yield.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we argue and present evidence that a focus on short-term stock prices
induces publicly-traded banks to increase risk relative to privately-held banks. Our findings raise
a number of additional questions.
First, what effect does the increase in risk-taking incentives of publicly-traded banks have
on the behavior of privately-held banks? If these incentives essentially increase the supply of
credit by publicly-traded banks, they make privately-held banks less profitable and may induce
them to take more risk as well. Alternatively, these private banks – which may be more focused

25

	  

	  

on long-run value – could reduce their supply of credit in response, acting as something of a
stabilizing force.
Second, do these sorts of risk-taking incentives exist in other non-bank financial
intermediaries? Kacperczyk and Schnabl (2013) and Chernenko and Sunderam (2014) present
evidence that suggests that they do. These papers show that assets under management in
institutional money market funds are much more sensitive to yield than are retail money market
funds, which in turn creates strong financial incentives for institutional money market funds to
increase risk, much as stock-market pressure creates incentives for banks to increase risk. It
would therefore not be surprising if institutional bond funds engaged in similar behavior, or if
open-ended bond funds took more risk than closed-end funds (which do not see greater fund
flows when yield increases). Similar incentives might also exist in insurance. While reaching for
yield has been shown to exist in insurance (Becker and Ivashina, forthcoming), our results raise
the question of whether it is more pronounced among publicly-traded insurance companies as
compared to mutual organizations.
Finally, what are the implications of bank risk-taking behavior for regulation? Our
findings provide some support for the view that compensation schemes should require
management to hold stock for longer periods to mitigate their incentives to pump up short-term
earnings and the short-term stock price. Of course, the wisdom of such a policy depends on
whether one believes that the risk-taking behavior documented here is socially excessive. Our
findings also point to a tension in regulatory policy. While bank regulators may want to limit the
extent to which banks respond to stock market pressure, securities regulators try to promote good
corporate governance, which tends to increase the power of shareholders to impact firm

26

	  

	  

behavior. As we have shown, good governance – and the stock market pressure associated with it
– may actually lead to an undesirable increase in risk.

Appendix: Variable Definitions
The variables used in this paper are extracted from four main data sources: the National Information Center (NIC) of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Terms of Business
Lending (STBL), Call Reports, and lists of announced (completed and withdrawn) IPOs and M&As
from SDC, Capital IQ, and SNL Financial. For each data item, we indicate the relevant source in
square brackets. The variables are defined as follows:
Bank Risk – Outcome Measures Based on Supervisory Data [NIC/STBL]:
Capital Adequacy rating: "A financial institution is expected to maintain capital commensurate
with its risks and the ability of management to identify, measure, monitor, and control these
risks. The capital adequacy of an institution is rated based on, but not limited to, an assessment
of the following evaluation factors: the level and quality of capital and the overall financial condition of the institution; the ability of management to address emerging needs for additional
capital; balance-sheet composition, including the nature and amount of intangible assets, market risk, concentration risk, and risks associated with nontraditional activities; risk exposure
represented by off-balance-sheet activities" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).
Asset Quality rating: "The asset-quality rating reflects the quantity of existing and potential
credit risk associated with the loan and investment portfolios, other real estate owned, other
assets, and off-balance-sheet transactions. The ability of management to identify, measure,
monitor, and control credit risk is also reflected here. The asset quality of a financial institution is rated based on, but not limited to, an assessment of the following evaluation factors: the
adequacy of underwriting standards, soundness of credit-administration practices, and appropriateness of risk-identification practices; the level, distribution, severity, and trend of problem,
classified, nonaccrual, restructured, delinquent, and nonperforming assets for both on- and offbalance-sheet transactions; the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and other
asset valuation reserves; the credit risk arising from or reduced by off-balance-sheet transactions, such as unfunded commitments, credit derivatives, commercial and standby letters of
credit, and lines of credit; the diversification and quality of the loan and investment portfolios; the extent of securities underwriting activities and exposure to counterparties in trading
activities; the existence of asset concentrations; the adequacy of loan and investment policies,
procedures, and practices; the ability of management to properly administer its assets, including the timely identification and collection of problem assets; the adequacy of internal controls
and management information systems; the volume and nature of credit-documentation exceptions" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).
Management rating: "The capability of the board of directors and management, in their respective roles, to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks of an institution’s activities, and
to ensure a financial institution’s safe, sound, and efficient operation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is reflected in this rating. The capability and performance of
management and the board of directors is rated based on, but not limited to, an assessment of
the following evaluation factors: the level and quality of oversight and support of all institution activities by the board of directors and management; the ability of the board of directors
and management, in their respective roles, to plan for and respond to risks that may arise from
changing business conditions or the initiation of new activities or products; the adequacy of
and conformance with appropriate internal policies and controls addressing the operations and
risks of significant activities; compliance with laws and regulations; responsiveness to recommendations from auditors and supervisory authorities; management depth and succession; the
extent that the board of directors and management are affected by or susceptible to dominant
30

influence or concentration of authority; reasonableness of compensation policies and avoidance
of self-dealing" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).
Earnings rating: "The earnings rating reflects not only the quantity and trend of earnings, but
also factors that may affect the sustainability or quality of earnings. High levels of market risk
may unduly expose the institution’s earnings to volatility in interest rates. The rating of an
institution’s earnings is based on, but not limited to, an assessment of the following evaluation
factors: the level of earnings, including trends and stability; the ability to provide for adequate
capital through retained earnings; the quality and sources of earnings; the level of expenses in
relation to operations; the adequacy of the budgeting systems, forecasting processes, and management information systems in general; the adequacy of provisions to maintain the allowance
for loan and lease losses and other valuation allowance accounts; the exposure of earnings to
market risk such as interest-rate, foreign-exchange, and price risks" (source: Commercial Bank
Examination Manual).
Liquidity rating: "In evaluating the adequacy of a financial institution’s liquidity position, consideration should be given to the current level and prospective sources of liquidity compared
to funding needs. Liquidity is rated based on, but not limited to, an assessment of the following
evaluation factors: the adequacy of liquidity sources compared with present and future needs
and the ability of the institution to meet liquidity needs without adversely affecting its operations or condition; the availability of assets readily convertible to cash without undue loss;
access to money markets and other sources of funding; the level of diversification of funding
sources, both on- and off-balance-sheet; the degree of reliance on short-term, volatile sources
of funds, including borrowings and brokered deposits, to fund longer-term assets; the trend
and stability of deposits; the ability to securitize and sell certain pools of assets; the capability
of management to properly identify, measure, monitor, and control the institution’s liquidity
position, including the effectiveness of funds-management strategies, liquidity policies, management information systems, and contingency funding plans" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).
Sensitivity to Market Risk rating: "The sensitivity to market risk component reflects the degree
to which changes in interest rates, foreign-exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices
can adversely affect a financial institution’s earnings or economic capital. Market risk is rated
based on, but not limited to, an assessment of the following evaluation factors: the sensitivity
of the financial institution’s earnings or the economic value of its capital to adverse changes in
interest rates, foreign-exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices; the ability of management to identify, measure, monitor, and control exposure to market risk given the institution’s
size, complexity, and risk profile; the nature and complexity of interest-rate risk exposure arising from nontrading positions; where appropriate, the nature and complexity of market-risk
exposure arising from trading and foreign operations" (source: Commercial Bank Examination
Manual).
CAMELS ("composite") rating: "The composite rating generally bears a close relationship to the
component ratings assigned. However, the composite rating is not derived by computing an
arithmetic average of the component ratings. When assigning a composite rating, some components may be given more weight than others depending on the situation at the institution.
The ability of management to respond to changing circumstances and address the risks that
may arise from changing business conditions or the initiation of new activities or products is
an important factor in evaluating a financial institution’s overall risk profile, as well as the level
of supervisory attention warranted" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).
Maximum Risk Score: Is defined as the tightest of the eight supervisory risk ratings ("component"
CAMELS, "composite" CAMELS, and STBL loan risk rating) for each bank in any given quarter.

Bad Rating Dummy: An indicator that equals one if the bank is rated as weak (a rating of 3
and above) along any of the eight supervisory ratings ("component" CAMELS, "composite"
CAMELS, and STBL loan risk rating) in any given quarter.

Table 1: Summary Statistics
This table presents summary statistics (means) for the main samples used in the analysis. Column (1) refers
to the starting merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample, which consists of 178,980 commercial bank-quarter
observations for the universe of commercial banks held by a BHC between 1990 and 2012. Column (2) refers
to the Switchers sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in the starting sample that over
the sample period experience a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC.
Switches occur for two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC,
and lead to 26,776 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 758 BHCs and 1,294 commercial banks
between 1990 and 2012. Column (3) refers to the baseline identification sub-sample, which is defined as those
commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and
either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privatelyheld BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition
of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bankquarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012.

Table 2: Descriptive Evidence
The starting sample is the merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample, which consists of 234,535 commercial bank-quarter observations for the universe of
commercial banks held by a BHC between 1990 and 2012. The Switchers sub-sample is defined as those commercial banks in the starting sample that over
the sample period experience a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. Switches occur for two reasons, an IPO or an
acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC. The Switchers sample consists of 26,776 commercial bank-quarter observations involving
758 BHCs and 1,294 commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. The period considered is the run-up to the crisis, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479
commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs and 788 unique commercial banks between 1997 and 2006. Panel A of this table reports
descriptive evidence for the starting sample. Specifically, we report parameter estimates from OLS regressions of each management score on a dummy that
equals one for commercial banks that are held by a publicly-traded BHC, while controlling for bank size. For the Switchers sample, we report parameter
estimates from OLS regressions of each management score (Panel B) and of bank decisions (Panel C) on a dummy that equals one for commercial banks that
are held by a publicly-traded BHC, while also controlling for commercial bank fixed effects. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions. Standard
errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 3: Difference-in-Differences Analysis, Diagnostic Tests – "Identification sample" with
Cancelled Deals as Control Group
The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHCCommercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or
withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The
announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publiclytraded BHC, which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique
BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports tests of the validity of
the control group construction for the difference-in-differences analysis. Panel A reports summary statistics of
pre-treatment CAMELS ratings, their trends, as well as balance sheet characteristics for banks in the treatment
(Column 1) and control (Column 2) samples, respectively. These variables are measured as of the quarter prior
to the announcement of a transition. Column 3 reports t-tests of the null hypothesis that treated and control
banks are similar along each characteristic. Panel B reports OLS estimates from a linear probability model
relating the likelihood of a deal succeeding to the pre-announcement characteristics of the commercial bank
involved. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust,

Table 4: Difference-in-Differences Analysis, Baseline Tests – "Identification sample" with Cancelled Deals as Control Group
The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over
the sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a
publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which
leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012.
The period considered is the run-up to the crisis, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs
and 788 unique commercial banks between 1997 and 2006. This table reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of each management
score (Panel A) and bank decisions (Panel B). Specifically, the DD specification that is estimated is RISK it = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit Treatmenti +
γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise, and
Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group. Year-quarter
dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***,
**, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports tests of the validity of the S&P Bank Index as an instrument
for deal completion in a two-stage least square (2SLS) analysis. Panel A reports summary statistics of preannouncement CAMELS ratings, their trends, as well as balance sheet characteristics for banks that experience
an S&P Bank Index drop (Column 1) and other banks in the sample (Column 2), respectively. These variables
are measured to include all quarters in the pre-announcement period starting from one year prior to the announcement of a transition. Column 3 reports t-tests of the null hypothesis that banks that experience an S&P
Bank Index drop are similar to other banks in the sample along each characteristic. A bank is classified as experiencing an S&P Bank Index drop if the two-month S&P Bank Index returns following its deal announcement
are at the bottom of the distribution of all announcements in the same year. Panel B reports OLS estimates from
a linear probability model relating the likelihood of a deal succeeding to alternative definitions of S&P Bank
Index drop and to the pre-announcement characteristics of the commercial bank involved. Filer year dummies are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust, with ***, **, and * denoting

Table 9: Additional Analysis of Bank Performance
The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample
period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publiclytraded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads
to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This
table reports the main results of a calendar-time analysis of the evolution of a bank’s operating performance after the quarter when it announces a privateto-public transition (t = 0). We report results for two metrics of bank operating performance, return on equity (ROE) in Panel A and return on assets (ROA)
in Panel B, respectively. Specifically, the specification that is estimated is P erf ormanceit+ N P erf ormanceit 1 = α + β1 Treatmenti + γZit + µt + εit ,
where Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group, and
N is the number of quarters since the quarter when the private-to-public transition is announced. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

table reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of alternative metrics of bank performance for a specification that allows for time-series
heterogeneity in the treatment effect by adding an interactive term with a crisis dummy (Panel A) and for the baseline specification (Panel B). Specifically,
the interactive DD specification that is estimated is P erf ormanceit = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit Treatmenti + β3 A f terit Treatmenti Crisist +
γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise,
Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group, and Crisis
is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all quarters between 2007Q4 and 2009Q4. Year-quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample
period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publiclytraded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a
sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This table
reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of a dummy for bad management score, which is defined as a rating of 3 or worse, and of
the bank risk factor for a specification that allows for cross-sectional (Panels A to D) and time-series (Panels E and F) heterogeneity in the treatment effect
by adding an interactive term. Specifically, the interactive DD specification that is estimated in Panels A to D is RISK it = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit
Treatmenti + β3 A f terit Treatmenti Xi + β4 A f terit Xi + γZit + γ1 A f terit Zit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a
value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise, Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial
banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group, and X is the cumulative density function of the sorting variable used in turn in each
column, which include the total number of directors (Column (1) of Panels A and B), the ratio of the number of directors that are insiders to the total number
of directors (Column (2) of Panels A and B), the GIM index of takeover protection by Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003) (Column (3) of Panels A and B), the
average institutional investors’ portfolio turnover based on Cahart (1997) (Column (1) of Panels C and D), the frequency of CEO net-sales of stock (Column
(2) of Panels C and D), the frequency of words related to short-term horizon in the transcripts of earnings conference calls (Column (3) of Panels C and D).
Note that in Panels A to D the term A f terit Xi cannot be estimated indendently from A f terit Treatmenti Xi because Xi does not vary within private
banks, and thus drops out of the estimation due to collinearity. Year-quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Figure 1: The Growth of Public Banking
This figure describes the evolution of aggregate total assets in the U.S. commercial banking sector from 1990
to 2014. Aggregate total assets of commercial banks are measured as the sum of consolidated assets reported
by each commercial bank in its Call Report filing for the universe of U.S. filers. Note that this definition does
not include nonbank assets of bank holding companies (BHCs), which would equal to the difference between
total assets as reported by BHCs in their Y-9C and those of commercial bank assets as defined in the figure. For
each commercial bank, we estimate the ownership status of its (top-holder) BHC based on a NIC indicator for
whether the BHC’s securities are traded and are subject to registration, or it is required to report to the SEC.
Panel A shows the level of aggregate total assets of U.S. commercial banks that are held by a publicly-traded
BHC and of U.S. commercial banks that are held by a privately-held BHC from 1990 to 2014. Panel B shows
the growth rate of these aggregate series. Specifically, we plot each of the two series scaled by its respective
1990Q1 level. Sources: National Information Center (NIC) and Call Reports.

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHCCommercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or
withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The
announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publiclytraded BHC, which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique
BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This figure shows the likelihood (average
annual frequency) of a bad CAMELS rating (vertical axis, Panel A) and a high (top decile) Risk Factor (vertical
axis, Panel B) in event time leading to and after the year when a bank announces a private-to-public transition
(t=0) for treated (the black line) and control banks (the gray line). Observations to the left (right) of the t=0 line
correspond to years before (after) transition announcement.

Panel A: Bad CAMELS Rating

Panel B: High Risk Factor

Appendix Table A.1: How Do Switchers Take On More Risk? Additional Analysis of Bank Decisions in the Run-Up to the Crisis
The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the
sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a
publicly-traded BHC. The period is 1997 to 2006. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a
publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs and 788 unique commercial
banks between 1997 and 2006. This table reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of bank decisions on Capital Adequacy and Asset
Quality (Panel A), and Liquidity and Risk (Panel B). Specifically, the DD specification that is estimated is Decisionit = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit
Treatmenti + γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero
otherwise, and Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control
group. Year and quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at
the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table A.2: Matched-Sample Difference-in-Differences Analysis, Baseline Tests – "Identification sample" with Cancelled Deals as
Control Group
The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the
sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a
publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which
leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012.
This table reports the main results of the matched-sample difference-in-differences analysis of each management score (Panel A) and of a dummy for bad
management score, which is defined as a rating of 3 or worse (Panel B). Specifically, the DD specification that is estimated is CAMELSit CAMELS it =
α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit Treatmenti + γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the quarters after
the announcement date and zero otherwise, and Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group
and zero for those in the matched control group. To implement the estimator, we use a methodology analogous to long-run event studies (e.g., Barber and
Lyons (1997)) and for each bank-quarter construct a "benchmark" CAMELS, CAMELS it , for a matched portfolio of banks. Matching is done with respect
to year and commercial bank size. Year and quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in
parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table A.3: Instrumental Variable (2-SLS) Analysis, Placebo Test – "Identification sample"
with Cancelled Deals as Control Group
The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHCCommercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and either complete or withdraw a switch
from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two
reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a sample
of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial
banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports a placebo test of the validity of the exclusion restriction in
the (2-SLS) instrumental variable analysis of Table 8 that uses the S&P Bank Index as an instrument for deal
completion. The dependent variable is the average of the composite CAMELS rating after transitions. Panel
A reports OLS estimates for alternative definitions of the S&P Bank Index drop in the two-month window
following either the completion or the withdrawal of a transition attempt. Panels B and C report OLS estimates
for alternative definitions of the S&P Bank Index drop in the two-month window from a year before and from
a year after the transition announcement, respectively. Filer year dummies are included in all regressions.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
level, respectively.

Appendix Table A.4: Difference-in-Differences Analysis, Diagnostic Tests – Balancing Tests of
Pre-Event Characteristics of Banks in the M&A Sample

The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged
BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period become targets of a completed M&A deal, which
involves either an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded acquirer that lead to an ownership
switch ("treatment" group) or an acquisition between two publicly-traded or two privately-held BHCs that do
not lead to an ownership switch ("control" group). The resulting sample consists of 2,431 unique commercial
banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports tests of the validity of the M&A sample construction for the
difference-in-differences analysis. Panel A reports summary statistics of pre-treatment CAMELS ratings, their
trends, as well as balance sheet characteristics for banks whose chartered is discontinued in the same quarter
when their BHC is acquired (Column 1), for banks whose chartered is discontinued in the next quarter after
the acquisition of their BHC (Column 2), and for banks whose charter is not discontinued either in the quarter
when their BHC is acquired or in the next quarter (Column 3), respectively. These variables are measured
as of the quarter prior to the M&A deal. Column 4 reports t-tests of the null hypothesis that banks whose
chartered is discontinued either in the quarter when their BHC is acquired or in the next quarter and those
banks whose charter is not discontinued until later or at all are similar along each characteristic. Panel B reports
OLS estimates from a linear probability model relating the likelihood that the bank charter is discontinued
either in the quarter when their BHC is acquired or in the next quarter to the pre-announcement characteristics
of the target commercial bank. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in
parentheses) are robust, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Pre-Event Characteristics of Banks in the M&A Sample (Continued)
The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged
BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period become targets of a completed M&A deal, which
involves either an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded acquirer that lead to an ownership
switch ("treatment" group) or an acquisition between two publicly-traded or two privately-held BHCs that do
not lead to an ownership switch ("control" group). The resulting sample consists of 2,431 unique commercial
banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports tests of the validity of the M&A sample construction for the
difference-in-differences analysis. Panel C reports summary statistics of pre-treatment CAMELS ratings, their
trends, as well as balance sheet characteristics for additional finer partitions of the sub-sample of banks whose
chartered is not discontinued in the quarter when their BHC is acquired or in the next quarter, which include
those whose charter is not discontinued for up to 1 year after their BHC is acquired (Column 2), for up to 2
years after their BHC is acquired (Column 3), and for up to 3 years after their BHC is acquired (Column 4),
respectively. These variables are measured as of the quarter prior to the M&A deal. Panel D reports additional
OLS estimates from a linear probability model relating the likelihood that the bank charter is discontinued
within N quarters after its BHC is acquired to the pre-announcement characteristics of the target commercial
bank. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust, with
***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table A.5: Bank Fixed Effects Analysis of Supervisory Ratings– ALL BHCs, "switchers sample" – IPOs only
The sample is the switchers sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample
period experience a switch from being held by a privately-held to a publicly-traded BHC. The table reports results for switches that occur due to an IPO,
which leads to a sample of 15,411 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 206 unique BHCs and 406 unique commercial banks between 1990 and
2012. This table reports parameter estimates from OLS regressions of each management score on a dummy that equals one for commercial banks that are
held by a publicly-traded BHC, while controlling for a standard set of bank characteristics. Year and quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed
effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table A.6: Additional Robustness of Baseline Tests to Supervisory Identity– "Identification sample" with Cancelled Deals as Control
Group
The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over
the sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC
to a publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC,
which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and
2012. The period considered is the run-up to the crisis, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique
BHCs and 788 unique commercial banks between 1997 and 2006. This table reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of supervisory
identity and frequency (Panel A) and each management score in a specification that adds controls for supervisory frequency (Panel B). Specifically, the DD
specification that is estimated is RISK it = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit
Treatmenti + γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that
takes a value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise, and Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one
for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group. Year-quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are
included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
level, respectively.
