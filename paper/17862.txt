ABSTRACT
We seek to understand how Laffer curves differ across countries in the US and the EU-14, thereby
providing insights into fiscal limits for government spending and the service of sovereign debt. As
an application, we analyze the consequences for the permanent sustainability of current debt levels,
when interest rates are permanently increased e.g. due to default fears. We build on the analysis in
Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) and extend it in several ways. To obtain a better fit to the data, we allow
for monopolistic competition as well as partial taxation of pure profit income. We update the sample
to 2010, thereby including recent increases in government spending and their fiscal consequences.
We provide new tax rate data. We conduct an analysis for the pessimistic case that the recent fiscal
shifts are permanent. We include a cross-country analysis on consumption taxes as well as a more
detailed investigation of the inclusion of human capital considerations for labor taxation.

1. Introduction
We seek to understand how Laffer curves differ across countries in the US and the EU-14. This
provides insight into the limits of taxation. As an application, we analyze the consequences of
recent increases in government spending and their fiscal consequences as well as the consequences
for the permanent sustainability of current debt levels, when interest rates are permanently high
e.g. due to default fears.
We build on the analysis in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011). There, we have characterized Laffer
curves for labor and capital taxation for the U.S., the EU-14, and individual European countries. In the analysis, a neoclassical growth model featuring “constant Frisch elasticity” (CFE)
preferences are introduced and analyzed: we use the same preferences here. The results there
suggest that the U.S. could increase tax revenues considerably more than the EU-14, and that
conversely the degree of self-financing of tax cuts is much larger in the EU-14 than in the U.S.
While we have calculated results for individual European countries, the focus there was directed
towards a comparison of the U.S. and the aggregate EU-14 economy.
This paper provides a more in-depth analysis of the cross-country comparison. Furthermore,
we modify the analysis in two important dimensions. The model in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011)
overstates total tax revenues to GDP compared to the data: in particular, labor tax revenues
to GDP are too high. We introduce monopolistic competition to solve this: capital income now
consists out of rental rates to capital as well as pure profits, decreasing the share of labor income
in the economy. With this change alone, the model now overpredicts the capital income tax
revenue. We therefore furthermore assume that only a fraction of pure profit income is actually
reported to the tax authorities and therefore taxed. With these two changes, the fit to the data
improves compared to the original version, see figure 2. In terms of the Laffer curves, this moves
countries somewhat closer to the peak of the labor tax Laffer curve and somewhat farther away
from the peak of the capital tax Laffer curve. For the cross-country comparison, we assume
that all structural parameters for technologies and preferences are the same across countries.
The differences between the Laffer curves therefore arise solely due to differences in fiscal policy
i.e. the mix of distortionary taxes, government spending and government debt. We find that

2

labor income and consumption taxes are important for accounting for most of the cross-country
differences.
We refine the methodology of Mendoza et al. (1994) to calculate effective tax rates on labor and
capital income. Broadly, we expand the measured labor tax base by including supplements to
wages as well as a fraction of entrepreneurial income of households. As a result, the refinements
imply a more reasonable labor share in line with the literature. More importantly, the average
1995-2010 labor income taxes turn out to be lower while capital income taxes are somewhat
higher as previously calculated in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011).
We update our analysis in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) by including the additional years 20082010. This is particularly interesting, as it allows us to examine the implications of the recent
substantial tax and revenue shocks. While recent fiscal policy changes were intended to be
temporary, we examine the pessimistic scenario that they are permanent. To do so, we calibrate
the model to the Laffer curves implied by the strained fiscal situation of 2010, and compare them
to the Laffer curves of the average extended sample 1995-2010. We find that the 2010 calibration
moves almost all countries closer to the peak of the labor tax Laffer curve, with the scope for
additional labor tax increases cut by a third for most countries and by up to one half for some
countries. It is important, however, to keep the general equilibrium repercussions of raising taxes
in mind: even though tax revenues may be increased by some limited amount, tax bases and
thereby output fall when moving to the peak of the Laffer curve due to the negative incentive
effects of higher taxes.
We then use these results to examine the scope for long-term sustainability of current debt levels,
when interest rates are permanently higher due to, say, default fears. This helps to understand
the more complex situation of an extended period with substantially increased interest rates due
to, say, default fears. More precisely, we answer the following question: what is the maximum
steady state interest rate on outstanding government debt that the government could afford
without cutting government spending, based on a calibration to the fiscal situation in 2010? To
do so, we calculate the implied peak of the Laffer curve and compute the maximum interest
rate on outstanding government debt in 2010 that would still balance the government budget
constraint in steady state. The results of our baseline model are in table 7: the most interesting
3

column there may be the second one. We find that the USA can afford the highest interest rate
if labor taxes are moved to the peak of the Laffer curve: depending on the debt measure used, a
real interest rate of of 12% to 15.5% is sustainable. Interestingly, Ireland can also afford the high
rate of 11.2%, when moving labor taxes only. By contrast, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
France, Greece and Italy can only afford permanent real rates in the range of 4.4% to 7.1%, when
financing the additional interest payments with higher labor tax rates alone, while, say, Germany,
Portugal and Spain can all afford an interest rate somewhere above 9%. The picture improves
somewhat, but not much, when labor taxes and capital taxes can both be adjusted: notably,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France and Italy cannot permanently afford real interest rates above
6.5%. Below we also examine the implications of human capital accumulation and show that the
maximum interest rates may be even lower than suggested by our baseline model. It is worth
emphasizing that we have not included the possibility of cutting government spending and/or
transfers and that our analysis has focussed on the most pessimistic scenario of a permanent
shift.
In the baseline model, physical capital is the production factor that gets accumulated. It may
be important, however, to allow for and consider human capital accumulation, when examining
the consequences of changing labor taxation. We build on the quantitative endogenous growth
models introduced in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), and provide a more detailed cross-country comparison. We find that the capital tax Laffer curve is affected only rather little across countries
when human capital is introduced into the model. By contrast, the introduction of human capital
has important effects for the labor income tax Laffer curve. Several countries are pushed on the
slippery slope sides of their labor tax Laffer curves once human capital is accounted for. Intuitively, higher labor taxes lead to a faster reduction of the labor tax base since households work
less and aquire less human capital which in turn leads to lower labor income. We recalculate the
implied maximum interest rates on government debt in 2010 when human capital accumulation
is allowed for in the model. Table 9 contains the results: the US may only afford a real interest
rate between 5.8% to 6.6% in this case. Most of the European countries cluster between 4% and
4.9% except for Denmark, Finland and Ireland who can afford real interest rates between 5.9%
and 9.5%.

We add a cross-country analysis on consumption taxes. In Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), we have
shown that the consumption tax Laffer curve has no peak. Essentially, the difference between the
labor tax Laffer curve and the consumption tax Laffer curve arises due to “accounting” reasons:
the additional revenues are provided as transfers, and are used for consumption purchases, to be
taxed at the consumption tax rate. In Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), we only provided the analysis
for the U.S. and the aggregate EU-14 economy. Here, we extend the consumption tax analysis
to individual countries. The range of maximum additional tax revenues (in percent of GDP) in
the baseline model is roughly 40-100 percent while it shrinks to roughly 10-30 percent in the
model with added human capital. Higher consumption taxes affect equilibrium labor via the
labor wedge, similar to labor taxes. As above, human capital amplifies the reduction of the labor
tax base triggered by the change in the labor wedge. Overall, maximum possible tax revenues
due to consumption taxes are reduced massively, although at fairly high consumption tax rates.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the model. The calibration and parameterization of the model can be found in section 3. Section 4 provides and discusses the results.
Section 5 discusses the extension of the model with human capital as well as the results for
consumption taxation. Finally, section 6 concludes.

2. Model
We employ the baseline model in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) and extend it by allowing for intermediate inputs, supplied by monopolistically competitive firms. Time is discrete, t = 0, 1, . . . , ∞.
Households maximize

kt = (1 − δ)kt−1 + xt

where ct , nt , kt , xt , bt , mt denote consumption, hours worked, capital, investment, government
bonds and an exogenous stream of payments. The household takes government consumption
gt , which provides utility, as given. Further, the household receives wages wt , dividends dt ,
profits Πt from firms and asset payments mt . The payments mt are a stand-in for net imports,
modelled here as exogenously given income from a “tree”, see Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) for
further discussion. The household obtains interest earnings Rtb and lump-sum transfers st from
the government. It has to pay consumption taxes τtc , labor income taxes τtn and capital income
taxes τtk on dividends and on a share ϕ of profits.1
As introduced and extensively discussed in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), but also used in Hall
(2009), Shimer (2009) and King and Rebelo (1999), we work with constant Frisch elasticity
preferences (CFE), given by

if η > 0, η ̸= 1, where κ > 0. These preferences are consistent with balanced growth and feature
a constant Frisch elasticity of labor supply, given by φ, without constraining the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution.

We allow for partial profit taxation due to the various deductions and exemptions that are available for firms
and households in this regard. Further, note that capital income taxes are levied on dividends net-of-depreciation
as in Prescott (2002, 2004) and in line with Mendoza et al. (1994).

In equilibrium, all firms set the same price which is a markup over marginal costs. Formally,

The government faces the budget constraint,
gt + st + Rtb bt−1 = bt + Tt

where government tax revenues are given by
Tt = τtc ct + τtn wt nt + τtk [(dt − δ)kt−1 + ϕΠt ]

(7)

It is the goal to analyze how the equilibrium shifts, as tax rates are shifted. More generally,
the tax rates may be interpreted as wedges as in Chari et al. (2007), and some of the results
in this paper carry over to that more general interpretation. What is special to the tax rate
interpretation and crucial to the analysis in this paper, however, is the link between tax receipts
and transfers (or government spending) via the government budget constraint.
The paper focuses on the comparison of balanced growth paths. We assume that government
debt, government spending as well as net imports do not deviate from their balanced growth
paths, i.e. we assume that bt−1 = ψ t b̄, gt = ψ t ḡ as well as mt = ψ t m̄ where ψ is the growth
factor of aggregate output. We consider exogenously imposed shifts in tax rates or in returns

7

on government debt. We assume that government transfers adjust according to the government
budget constraint (6), rewritten as st = ψ t b̄(ψ − Rtb ) + Tt − ψ t ḡ.
2.1

Equilibrium

In equilibrium the household chooses plans to maximize its utility, the firm solves its maximization problem and the government sets policies that satisfy its budget constraint. In what follows,
key balanced growth relationships of the model that are necessary for computing Laffer curves
are summarized. Except for hours worked, interest rates and taxes all other variables grow at a
1

constant rate ψ = ξ 1−θ . For CFE preferences, the balanced growth after-tax return on any asset
is R̄ = ψ η /β. It is assumed throughout that ξ ≥ 1 and that parameters are such that R̄ > 1,
but β is not necessarily restricted to be less than one. Let k/y denote the balanced growth path
value of the capital-output ratio kt−1 /yt . In the model, it is given by

It remains to solve for the level of equilibrium labor. Let c/y denote the balanced growth path
ratio ct /yt . With the CFE preference specification and along the balanced growth path, the

given values for preference parameters, production parameters, tax rates and the levels of b̄, ḡ

Data, calibration and parameterization

The model is calibrated to annual post-war data of the USA, the aggregate EU-14 economy and
individual European countries. An overview of the calibration is in tables 1 and 2.
We refine the methodology of Mendoza et al. (1994) to calculate effective tax rates on labor and
capital income. Broadly, we expand the measured labor tax base by including supplements to
wages as well as a fraction of entrepreneurial income of households. As a result, the refinements
imply a more reasonable labor share in line with the empirical literature. More importantly, the
average 1995-2010 labor income taxes turn out to be lower while capital income taxes are higher
as previously calculated in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011). Appendix A provides the new tax rates
across countries over time and Appendix B contains the details on the calculations with further
discussion of the implications for e.g. the Laffer curves.
9

There are two new key parameters, compared to Trabandt and Uhlig (2011). The first parameter
is ω, the gross markup, due to monopolistic competition. We set ω = 1.1, which appears to be a
reasonable number, given the literature. The second parameter is ϕ, the share of monopolisticcompetition profits which are subject to capital taxes. We set this parameter equal to the capital
share, i.e. to 0.36. While we could have explored specific evidence to help us pin down this
parameter, we have chosen this value rather arbitrarily and with an eye towards the fit of the
model to the data instead.
The sample covered in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) is 1995-2007. Here we extend the sample
to 2010 using the same data sources. We update all data up to 2010, except for taxes and
tax revenues which we can update only to 2009 due to data availability reasons. For most of
the analysis in this paper, we assume that the 2010 observation for taxes and revenues are the
same as in 2009. We also pursue an alternative approach for tax rates for the year 2010, see
subsection 3.2 below for the details.
We also refine the calculation of transfers in the data compared to Trabandt and Uhlig (2011).
In the data, there is a non-neglible difference between government tax revenues and government
revenues. This difference is mostly due to “other government revenue” and “government sales”.
We substract these two items from the measure of transfers defined in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011).
US and aggregate EU-14 tax rates, government expenditures and government debt are set according to the upper part of table 1. We also calibrate the model to individual EU-14 country data
for tax rates, government spending and government debt as provided in table 2. Although we
allow fiscal policy to be different across countries, we restrict the analysis to identical parameters
across countries for preferences and technology, see the lower part of table 1 for the details.2
Finally, the empirical measure of government debt for the US as well as the EU-14 area provided
by the AMECO database is nominal general government consolidated gross debt (excessive deficit
procedure, based on ESA 1995) which is divided by nominal GDP. For the US the gross debt to
GDP ratio is 66.2% in the sample. For checking purposes, we also examine the implications if
2
See Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) for the differences with respect to Laffer curves when parameters for technology
and preferences are assumed to be identical or country specific.

10

we use an alternative measure of US government debt: debt held by the public. See tables 1 and
2 for the differences. However, given that to our knowledge data on “debt held by the public”
is not available for European countries, we shall proceed by using gross debt as a benchmark if
not otherwise noted. Where appropriate, we shall perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to
the measure of US government debt.

3.1

Model Fit and Sensitivity

The structual parameters are set such that model implied steady states are close to the data. In
particular, figure 1 provides a comparison of the data vs. model fit for key great ratios, hours
as well as transfers and tax revenues.3 Overall, the fit is remarkable given the relatively simple
model in which country differences are entirely due to fiscal policy.4
Most of the structual parameter values in the lower part of table 1 are standard and perhaps
uncontroversial, see e.g. Cooley and Prescott (1995), Prescott (2002, 2004, 2006) and Kimball
and Shapiro (2008).
The new parameters here compared to Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) are the gross markup, ω = 1.1
and the share of monopolistic-competition profits subject to capital taxation, ϕ = θ = 0.36.
Figure 2 contains a sensitivity analysis for ω and ϕ. When ω → 1, the model overstates labor tax
revenues and understates capital tax revenues, see the black crosses in figure 2.5 In the adapted
model with intermediate inputs, a gross markup ω > 1 reduces the labor tax base. At the same
time, profits increase the capital tax base, but too much if profits are fully subject to capital
taxation, i.e. ϕ = 1, see the red triangles in figure 2. Overall, the fit improves considerably if we
set the share of profits subject to capital taxes, ϕ = θ = 0.36. The fit is not sensitive to ϕ: all
values in ϕ ∈ [0.3, 0.4] work practically just as well in terms of the fit, for example.
3

We assume a mapping of data and model in the literal sense, i.e. the one based on the definitions of the
national income and product accounts and the revenues statistics. For work that takes an alternative perspective
and emphasizes the general relativity of fiscal language, see Green and Kotlikoff (2009).
4
The present paper, and in particular the comparison of data vs. model hours is closely related to Prescott
(2002, 2004) and subsequent contributions by e.g. Blanchard (2004), Alesina et al. (2006), Ljungqvist and Sargent
(2007), Rogerson (2007) and Pissarides and Ngai (2009).
5
Note that in this case, the value of ϕ becomes immaterial since equilibrium profits are zero.

11

3.2. The year 2010
At the end of our sample, government spending and government debt have risen substantially
as a fallout of the financial crisis, see table 2. We are particularly interested in characterizing
Laffer curves for the year 2010. While there is no tax rate data for the year 2010 at the time
of writing this paper, we do have data for government spending and debt in 2010. We wish to
consider the pessimistic scenario of a steady state, in which these changes are permanent. We
therefore use the government budget constraint of the model to infer the labor tax rate, i.e. we
calculate the implied labor tax given government debt and government consumption in 2010 as
well as average (1995-2010) model implied government transfers.
Table 2 contains the resulting labor tax rates across countries. According to the model, in the
US and EU-14 labor taxes need to be 5-8 percentage points higher to balance the government
budget in 2010 compared to the sample average. There is substantial country specific variation.
While e.g. labor taxes in Germany and Italy remain unchanged, those in the United Kingdom,
Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands increase by 10 or more percentage points.

4. Results
4.1. Sources of differences of Laffer curves
What accounts for the differences between the USA Laffer curves and (individual) EU-14 Laffer
curves? To answer this question, we proceed as follows. As before, we calibrate the model to
country specific averages of 1995-2010, see table 2, keeping structural parameters as in table 1.
Next, we compute Laffer curves.
Results are in the “Baseline” column of tables 3 and 4. All other columns report results if in
the USA calibration, fiscal instruments are set to European country specific values, one at a
time. It appears that labor income and consumption taxes are most important for accounting
for cross-country differences.
Imposing country specific debt to GDP ratios has no effect in our calculations, due to Ricardian
equivalence: a different debt to GDP ratio, holding taxes and government consumption fixed,
results in different transfers along the equilibrium path.
12

Finally, note that compared to Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), intermediate inputs and profit taxation in the present paper move countries somewhat closer to the peak of the labor tax Laffer
curve and somewhat farther away from the peak of the capital tax Laffer curve.

4.2. Laffer curves: average 1995-2010 vs. 2010
To compute Laffer curves, we trace out tax revenues across balanced growth paths, as we change
either labor tax rates or capital tax rates, and computing the resulting changes in transfers. When
changing both tax rates, we obtain a “Laffer hill”. We compute Laffer curves and the Laffer hill
for a 1995-2010 vs. 2010 calibration, i.e., when the model is calibrated in terms of fiscal policy
either to the average of 1995-2010 or to the year 2010, see table 2. Structural parameters are set
as in table 1.
Figure 3 shows the resulting Laffer curves for all countries for the average 1995-2010 calibration.
Figure 4 provides a comparison of Laffer curves for the 1995-2010 vs. 2010 calibration for the
USA and aggregate EU-14 economy. Further cross-country results in this respect are available in
table 5 and in figure 5. The latter figure shows how far each country is from its peak, given its
own tax rate: perhaps not surprisingly, the points line up pretty well. In the figure, we compare
it to the benchmark of performing the same calculation for the US, given by the dash-dotted
line: there, we change, say, the labor tax rate, and, for each new labor tax rate, recalculate κ as
well as ḡ, m̄ and b̄ to obtain the same n̄ and g/y, b/y and m/y as in table 1. We then recalculate
s̄ and s/y to balance the government budget and calculate the distance to the peak of the Laffer
curve. One would expect this exercise to result in a line with a slope close to -1, and indeed,
this is what the figure shows. The points for the individual countries line up close to this line,
though not perfectly: in particular, for the capital tax rate, the distance can be considerable,
and is largely explained by the cross-country variation in labor taxes and consumption taxes.
According to the results, the vast majority of countries have moved closer to the peaks of their
labor and capital income tax Laffer curves and Laffer hills respectively. The movements to the
peaks are sizeable for some countries such as e.g. the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and
Ireland for labor taxes. As above and for the average 1995-2010 sample, it does not matter

13

whether “gross US debt or “US debt held by the public” is used. For the year 2010, however,
small differences arise since transfers are kept at the model average for 1995-2010.
Finally, table 6 provides the output losses associated with moving to the peak of the Laffer curve.
According to the model, US and EU-14 output falls by about 27 respectively 14 percent when
labor taxes are moved to the peak of the Laffer curve. The magnitudes for the case of capital
taxes are similar. There is considerable country specific variation among European countries:
Denmark looses 4 percent while Ireland looses 24 percent of output at the labor tax Laffer curve
peak. Clearly, if a country is already close to its Laffer curve peak in terms of tax rates, the
output losses associated with increasing taxes a little more to attain the peak are more muted
than in a country that has more scope to increase tax revenues. Nevertheless, the table highlights
the general equilibrium repercussions of raising taxes: even though tax revenues may be increased
by some limited amount, tax bases and thereby output fall when moving to the peak of the Laffer
curve due to the negative incentive effects of higher taxes.

4.3. Laffer curve and interest rates
What is the maximum interest rate on outstanding government debt that the government could
afford without cutting government spending? Put differently, how high can interest rates on
government debt be due to, say, default fears (and not due to generally higher discounting by
households), so that fiscal sustainability is still preserved if countries move to the peak of their
Laffer curves?
To answer this question we pursue the following experiment. We calibrate the model in terms of
fiscal policy to the year 2010, see table 2. Structual parameters are set as in table 1. We calculate
Laffer curves for labor and capital taxation as well as the Laffer hill for joint variations of capital
and labor taxes. Keeping model implied government transfers and government consumption
to GDP ratios at their 2010 levels, we calcuate the interest rate that balances the government
budget at maximal tax revenues.
For the calcuations, we focus on balanced growth relationships ignoring transition issues for
simplicity. Consider the scaled government budget constraint along the balanced growth path:

denotes the maximum additional tax revenues (expressed in % of baseline GDP)
M ax

that results from moving from the 2010 status quo to the peak of the Laffer curve. We solve for
R̄M ax = 1 + r̄M ax that balances the above government budget constraint.
Table 7 contains the baseline model results. For each of the three tax experiments (adjusting only
labor taxes, adjusting only capital taxes, adjusting both), the table lists the maximal additional
obtainable revenue as a share of GDP as well as the maximal sustainable interest rate that can be
sustained with these revenues. For comparison, the last two columns of the table also contain real
long-term interest rates for 2010 downloaded from the European Commission AMECO database.
These are nominal 10 years government bond interest rates minus inflation - either using the GDP
deflator (ILRV, first column) or the consumption deflator (ILRC, second column). The value for
the aggregate EU-14 is the real GDP weighted average of individual European countries.
The most interesting column in table 7 may be the second one. We find that the USA can afford
the highest interest rate if labor taxes are moved to the peak of the Laffer curve: depending on the
debt measure used, a real interest rate of of 12% to 15.5% is sustainable. Interestingly, Ireland can
also afford the high rate of 11.2%, when moving labor taxes only. By contrast, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Greece and Italy can only afford permanent real rates in the range of
4.4% to 7.1%, when financing the additional interest payments with higher labor tax rates alone,
while, say, Germany, Portugal and Spain can all afford an interest rate somewhere above 9%.
The picture improves somewhat, but not much, when labor taxes and capital taxes can both be
adjusted: notably, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France and Italy cannot permanently afford real
interest rates above 6.5%.
Note that now, the comparison of “US gross government debt” vs. “US debt held by the public”
matters for the results since government spending is kept constant. Indeed, the US could affort
higher interest rates if “US debt held by the public” is considered.

15

Interestingly, in the next section, we also examine the implications of human capital accumulation
and show that the maximum interest rates may be even lower than suggested by our baseline
model.
For the above analysis, some caveats should be kept in mind. The interest rate on outstanding government debt deviates from the one on private capital but does not crowd out private
investment. In other words, it is implicitly assumed that the interest rate payments due to the
higher interest rate are paid lump-sum to the households and thereby do not affect household
consumption, hours or investment, and that it does not affect the rate at which firms can borrow
privately.6
Note that the steady state safe real interest rate is calibrated to equal 4 percent and represents
therefore the lower bound for r̄M ax : our analysis on sustainable rates may therefore be too
optimistic, keeping in mind that the interest rates are real interest rates, not nominal interest
rates. It is worth emphasizing that we have not included the possibility of cutting government
spending and/or transfers and that our analysis has focussed on the most pessimistic scenario of
a permanent shift.

5. Extensions: human capital, consumption taxes
5.1. Baseline model vs. human capital accumulation
We compare the distance to the peak of Laffer curves for the above baseline model and the
above baseline model with added human capital accumulation. More specifically, we assume
that human capital is accumulated following the second generation case considered in Trabandt
and Uhlig (2011).7
6

For related work, see e.g. Bi (2010) and Bi et al. (2010).
See e.g. Jones (2001), Barro and i Martin (2003) or Acemoglu (2008) for textbook treatments of models with
endogenous growth and human capital accumulation. Below we consider a specification incorporating learning-bydoing as well as schooling, following Lucas (1988) and Uzawa (1965). While first-generation endogenous growth
models have stressed the endogeneity of the overall long-run growth rate, second-generation growth models have
stressed potentially large level effects, without affecting the long-run growth rate. We shall focus on the second
generation case here since little evidence has been found that taxation impacts on the long-run growth rate, see
e.g. Levine and Renelt (1992).
7

16

In particular, we assume that human capital can be accumulated by both learning-by-doing
as well as schooling. The agent splits total non-leisure time nt into work-place labor qt nt and
schooling time (1 − qt )nt , where 0 ≤ qt ≤ 1. Agents accumulate human capital according to
ht = (Aqt nt + B(1 − qt )nt )ν h1−ν
t−1 + (1 − δh )ht−1

(14)

where A ≥ 0 and B > A parameterize the effectiveness of learning-by-doing and schooling
respectively and where 0 < δh ≤ 1 is the depreciation rate of human capital. Wages are paid per
unit of labor and human capital so that the after-tax labor income is given by (1 − τtn )wt ht−1 qt nt .
Given this, the adaptions of the model on the parts of firms is straightforward so that we shall
leave them out here.
The model is calibrated to the average of 1995-2010 for fiscal variables. Standard parameters for
technology and preferences are set as in table 1. Parameters for human capital accumulation are
set as in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011). More precisely, the same calibration strategy for the initial
steady state is applied as before, except assuming now q̄n̄U S = 0.25. Further, ν = 0.5 and δh = δ
are set for simplicity. A is set such that initial q̄U S = 0.8. Moreover, B is set to have hU S = 1
initially.
Figure 6 shows the comparison for the US and EU-14. Further cross-country results are contained
in figure 7. Interestingly, the capital tax Laffer curve is affected only very little across countries
when human capital is introduced. By contrast, the introduction of human capital has important
effects for the labor income tax Laffer curve. Several countries are pushed on the slippery slope
sides of their labor tax Laffer curves. This result is due to two effects. First, human capital
turns labor into a stock variable rather than a flow variable as in the baseline model. Higher
labor taxes induce households to work less and to aquire less human capital which in turn leads
to lower labor income. Consequently, the labor tax base shrinks much more quickly when labor
taxes are raised. Second, the introduction of intermediate inputs moves countries closer to the
peaks of their labor tax Laffer curves already in the baseline model compared to Trabandt and
Uhlig (2011). This effect is reinforced when human capital is introduced.

17

Finally, we recalculate the implied maximum interest rates on government debt in 2010 when
human capital accumulation is allowed for in the model. Table 9 contains the results: the US
may only afford a real interest rate between 5.8% to 6.6% in this case. Most of the European
countries cluster between 4% and 4.9% except for Denmark, Finland and Ireland who can afford
real interest rates between 5.9% and 9.5%.
5.2. Consumption taxes
We compute maximum additional tax revenues that are possible from increasing consumption
taxes. We do this in the above baseline model and in the model with added human capital
accumulation as in the previous subsection. The model is calibrated to the average of 1995-2010
for fiscal variables. Standard parameters for technology and preferences are set as in table 1.
Parameters for human capital accumulation are set as in the previous subsection.
The upper panel of figure 8 shows the comparison for the US and EU-14. Further cross-country
results are shown in the lower panel of the same figure. As documented and examined in Trabandt
and Uhlig (2011), the consumption tax Laffer curve has no peak. However, the introduction
of human capital has important quantitative effects across countries. The range of maximum
additional tax revenues (in percent of GDP) in the above baseline model is roughly 40-100
percent while it shrinks to roughly 10-30 percent in the model with added human capital. Higher
consumption taxes affect equilibrium labor via the labor wedge, similar to labor taxes. Human
capital amplifies the reduction of the labor tax base triggered by the change in the labor wedge
by the same argument as in the previous subsection. Overall, maximum possible tax revenues
due to consumption taxes are reduced massively, although at fairly high consumption tax rates.

6. Conclusion
We have studied how Laffer curves differ across countries in the US and the EU-14. This provides
insight into the limits of taxation. To that end, we extended the analysis in Trabandt and
Uhlig (2011) to include monopolistic competition as well as partial taxation of the monopolisticcompetition profits: we have shown that this improves the fit to the data considerably. We
have also provided refined data for effective labor and capital income taxes across countries.
18

For the cross-country comparison, we assume that all structural parameters for technologies and
preferences are the same across countries. The differences between the Laffer curves therefore
arise solely due to differences in fiscal policy i.e. the mix of distortionary taxes, government
spending and government debt. We find that labor income and consumption taxes are important
for accounting for most of the cross-country differences.
To examine recent developments, we calibrate the steady state of the model to the Laffer curves
implied by the strained fiscal situation of 2010, and compare them to the Laffer curves of the
average extended sample 1995-2010. We find that the 2010 calibration moves all countries considerably closer to the peak of the labor tax Laffer curve, with the scope for additional labor
tax increases cut by a third for most countries and by up to one half for some countries. In this
context, we show that it is important to keep the general equilibrium repercussions of raising
taxes in mind: even though tax revenues may be increased by some limited amount, tax bases
and thereby output fall when moving to the peak of the Laffer curve due to the negative incentive
effects of higher taxes.
We calculate the implications for the long-term sustainability of current debt levels, by calculating the maximal permanently sustainable interest rate. We calculated that the USA can afford
the highest interest rate if only labor taxes are adjusted to service the additional debt burden:
depending on the debt measure used, a real interest rate of of 12% to 15.5% is sustainable.
Interestingly, Ireland can also afford the high rate of 11.2%, when moving labor taxes only. By
contrast, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece and Italy can only afford permanent real rates in the range of 4.4% to 7.1%, when financing the additional interest payments
with higher labor tax rates alone, while, say, Germany, Portugal and Spain can all afford an
interest rate somewhere above 9%. The picture improves somewhat, but not much, when labor
taxes and capital taxes can both be adjusted: notably, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France and
Italy cannot permanently afford real interest rates above 6.5%.
We have shown that the introduction of human capital has important effects for the labor income
tax Laffer curve across countries. Several countries are pushed on the slippery slope sides of
their labor tax Laffer curves once human capital is accounted for. We recalculated the implied
maximum interest rates on government debt in 2010 when human capital accumulation is allowed
19

for in the model. In this case, the US may only afford a real interest rate between 5.8% to 6.6%.
Most of the European countries cluster between 4% and 4.9% except for Denmark, Finland and
Ireland who can afford real interest rates between 5.9% and 9.5%.
We have performed a cross-country analysis on consumption taxes. We document that the range
of maximum additional tax revenues (in percent of GDP) in the baseline model is roughly 40100 percent while it shrinks to roughly 10-30 percent in the model with added human capital,
although the underlying consumption taxes are fairly high in both cases.

Figure 2: Sensitivity of “actual” vs. “predicted” tax revenues and government transfers. “Actual” refers to data sample averages for 1995-2010.
“Predicted” refers to model implied steady state (balanced growth path). Three cases are examined. The benchmark case is the model used in the
paper, and as in figure 1. The case ω → 1 obtains, when there is no market power by intermediate goods producers: this is our previously used model
in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011). Finally, there is the intermediate case with monopolistic competition, but where profits are fully subject to capital
taxation, ϕ = 1. Note that all other variables plotted in figure 1 are unaffected by the sensitivity analysis, except for hours. However, the impact on
hours is small and therefore omitted here. All other parameters and steady states are as in tables 1 and 2 (gross US debt).

Figure 5: Distance to the peak of Laffer curves for average 1995-2010 vs. 2010 calibration. The model is either
calibrated to the average of 1995-2010 or to the 2010, see table 2 (gross US debt). Parameters for technology and
preferences are set as in table 1 (gross US debt). Horizontal axis shows calibrated tax rates. Vertial axis shows
distance to the peak in terms of tax rates. The dashed-dotted line shows the distance to the peak for the US
when the initial steady state tax is varied and the model is re-calibrated for each assumed tax rate.

Figure 6: Labor and capital tax Laffer curves: the impact of endogenous human capital accumulation. Shown are
steady state (balanced growth path) total tax revenues when labor taxes are varied between 0 and 100 percent
in the USA and EU-14. All other taxes and parameters are held constant. Total tax revenues at the average
tax rates are normalized to 100. Two cases are examined. First, the benchmark model with exogenous growth.
Second, the benchmark model with a second generation version of endogenous human capital accumulation (see
the main text and Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) for details). The model is calibrated to the average of 1995-2010
for fiscal variables. Standard parameters for technology and preferences are set as in table 1 (gross US debt).
Parameters for human capital accumulation are set as in the main text Trabandt and Uhlig (2011).

Appendix B. Calculation of tax rates
We use the same data sources as in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), i.e. the AMECO database of
the European Commission, the OECD revenue statistics database and the NIPA database of the
BEA.
In this paper, we refine the methodology of Mendoza et al. (1994) to calculate effective tax rates
on labor and capital income. Broadly, we expand the measured labor tax base by including
supplements to wages as well as a fraction of entrepreneurial income of households. Supplements
to wages beyond employers social security contributions account for about 7 percent of e.g. U.S.
GDP. Also, entrepreneurial income of households is sizable as a fraction of GDP but entirely
accounted as capital income in Mendoza et al. (1994). We argue that at least a fraction, say
α, of this income ought to be attributed to labor income. As a result, the refinements imply
in a more reasonable labor share in line with the empirical literature. More importantly, the
average 1995-2010 labor income taxes turn out to be lower while capital income taxes are higher
as previously calculated in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011). Table B.14 provides an overview of the

Note that we retain the assumption in Mendoza et al. (1994) that, implicitly, income from capital and labor
is taxed at the same rate. In future research, it would be interesting to take differences in the taxation of labor
and capital income explicitly into account when calculating tax rates.

OS: Net operating surplus: total economy (AMECO, NIPA).
W: Gross wages and salaries: households and NPISH (AMECO, NIPA).
OSPUE+PEI: Gross operating surplus minus consumption of fixed capital plus mixed income
plus net property income: households and NPISH (AMECO).
Wsuppl : Supplements to wages: households and NPISH. Calculated as the residual of compensation of employees minus wages and salaries minus social security contributions of employers.

We select a value for α such that the average 1995-2010 labor share, i.e. W +W suppl +α(OSP U E+
P EI) + 2200)/GDP equals 64 percent in the U.S. It turns out that we need to set α = 0.35. We
keep the same value for α for all other countries.
Table B.15 shows the resulting effective tax rates across countries and compares them to those
when the standard Mendoza et al. (1994) methodology is applied as used e.g. in Trabandt and
Uhlig (2011). It turns out, that due to the broader labor tax base, effective labor taxes are
somewhat smaller while effective capital taxes are higher.
Finally, table B.16 provides maximum additional tax revenues that result from moving from
the peak of the Laffer curve when either the standard Mendoza et al. (1994) tax rates or the
refined version proposed in this paper are used. Further, the table also shows the implications

45

of imperfect vs. perfect competition. The introduction of imperfect competition reduces the
effective labor tax base and thus less additional tax revenues are attainable when varying labor
taxes. By contrast, profits arising from market power increase maximum additional tax revenues
when capital taxes are varied. The fourth column shows the results when the standard Mendoza
tax rates are used in the analysis and are essentially those obtained by Trabandt and Uhlig
(2011). In this case, higher effective labor taxes at the status quo equlibrium reduce the scope
for more tax revenues when labor and capital taxes are varied.

Table B.16: Laffer curves for the 1995-2010 calibration. ∆T M ax denotes the maximum additional tax revenues (in
%) that results from moving from to the peak of the Laffer curve. Results are shown for the standard Mendoza
et al. (1994) taxes used in Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), “TU”, as well as for the refined tax rate calculations
discussed in Appendix B. Further, the case of imperfect competition with a gross markup ω = 1.1 is compared
to the case of perfect competition, i.e. ω → 1.
