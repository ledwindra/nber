ABSTRACT
The decline in the costs of multinational production (MP) has led some countries to specialize in
innovation and others to specialize in production. To study the aggregate and distributional
implications of this phenomenon, we develop a quantifiable general equilibrium model of trade
and MP. Specialization is endogenously determined as a result of comparative advantage and
home market effects (HME) that arise from the interaction between increasing returns to
innovation and geographical frictions. The model yields simple structural expressions for bilateral
trade and MP that we use to calibrate it across a set of OECD countries. Comparative statics
exercises reveal that the reduction in the cost of MP or the integration of China into the world
economy may hurt countries that are driven to specialize in production due to HMEs, although
these losses tend to be very small. Contrary to popular fears, we find that production workers gain
even in countries that further specialize in innovation.

Introduction

One consequence of globalization, and in particular the rise of multinational production
(MP), is that goods are increasingly being produced far from where ideas are created. International specialization in innovation and production is clearly evident in the aggregate data.
Figure 1 shows that the most innovative OECD countries, as measured by R&D expenditures
in manufacturing relative to local value-added, are home to multinationals whose foreign affiliate sales exceed the sales of foreign multinational affiliates in their country. With increasing globalization, this pattern has become more pronounced over time. Figure 2 shows that
R&D expenditures relative to manufacturing value-added in the United States has grown
from 8.7 percent in 1999 to 12.7 percent in 2009. Over the same period, U.S. firms have increased the share of their total global employment that is located in their foreign affiliates
from 22 to 31 percent. This is thanks in large part to an increasing presence in China, which
now accounts for one in eight employees of the foreign affiliates of U.S. firms.
Being a recent phenomenon, specialization in production or innovation raises a host of
concerns. Countries that specialize in production worry that low innovation will damage
their growth prospects, while countries that specialize in innovation worry that this specialization pattern will reduce the availability of good middle-income jobs. Viewed from the perspective of the standard two-sector trade theory, concerns about specialization in production
may seem misguided, since specialization would reflect comparative advantage and bring
about efficiency gains. But there are two reasons why it is legitimate to worry about specialization in production as opposed to innovation. First, the expansion of production could
trigger a deterioration of a country’s terms of trade. Second, innovation is an increasingreturns-to-scale activity, so that standard reasoning based on comparative advantage is insufficient. In particular, the combination of fixed costs of innovation and frictions to the
movement of ideas across borders leads to home-market effects (HMEs) in innovation, and,
as shown by Venables (1987), specialization induced by HMEs could lead to non-standard
welfare effects.
In this paper we develop a quantifiable, multi-country general-equilibrium model of
trade and MP that captures these forces in a rich geographic setting. We use the model to
quantify the welfare implications of shocks driving increased specialization in innovation
and production, including a generalized reduction in the cost of transferring technologies
across borders, the integration of China into the global economy, and the impact of selective
integration or breakups between countries.
Following Melitz (2003), we model innovation as the creation of heterogeneous firms that
sell differentiated goods in monopolistically competitive markets separated by fixed and

is defined as outward affiliate sales - inward affiliate sales divided by their sum.

variable trade costs. We depart from the Melitz model by assuming that firms can locate
production outside of their home market and assume that firm productivity levels across locations are drawn from a multivariate distribution. Firms face a tradeoff in choosing where
to produce for any particular market: they could locate production close to their customers to
avoid trade costs or they could locate where production costs are lower. By allowing firms to
produce outside of their home country, MP allows some countries to specialize in innovation
and others to specialize in production, with profits flowing from producing to innovating
countries to compensate for the cost of innovation.1 Loosely speaking, innovative countries
export ideas and import goods.
The model provides a natural framework to explore the aggregate and distributional implications of openness to trade and MP. We find that countries that specialize in innovation
tend to realize larger gains from openness than implied by current models (e.g. Ramondo &
Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013)), while countries that are most at risk from adverse welfare effects are
1 In

the absence of MP, the share of labor devoted to innovation would be the same in all countries. This is
consistent with the version of the Melitz model presented in Arkolakis, Demidova, Klenow & Rodrı́guez-Clare
(2008), where entry is endogenous, but not affected by trade costs. An equivalent result is derived by Eaton &
Kortum (2001) in a setting with Bertrand competition.

Figure 2: Manufacturing R&D and Employment of U.S. Multinationals Firms.

Notes: Data are from OECD STAN and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The employment share for
U.S. firms at their foreign affiliates is defined as total employment of U.S. majority-owned, manufacturing
affiliates abroad divided by total U.S. manufacturing employment plus U.S. majority-owned, manufacturing
affiliates abroad minus the employment of the affiliates of foreign-owned manufacturing affiliates operating in
the United States.

those that experience a contraction of innovation. In addition, by allowing for worker heterogeneity in their skills for innovation and production as in Roy (1951), openness to trade
and MP not only alters the distribution of income in intuitive ways but can lead to a loss
of welfare for some workers even as the country’s aggregate real income increases. This result resonates with the popular fear that the real wage of production workers in innovative
countries such as the United States may fall as multinational firms move production abroad.
The quantitative analysis starts by deriving and testing a novel implication of our model,
namely that trade flows restricted to the parents and affiliates of firms from a given country
are more sensitive to trade costs than overall trade flows. Using high-quality data from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on the sales of U.S. firms and their foreign affiliates,
we estimate restricted and standard gravity equations and find that the trade elasticities are
consistent with this prediction. These two elasticities will also serve as key targets in our
calibration.
The model is calibrated using trade, MP, and production data for 26 countries. We identify the full set of trade and MP frictions between countries and a vector of parameters that
govern comparative advantage by fitting aggregate bilateral trade and MP data under the
4

assumptions that all trade and MP frictions are symmetric between pairs of countries. Intuitively, specialization in innovation or production that cannot be explained by geography is
due to comparative advantage.2
We use the calibrated model to perform several counterfactual exercises. First, we consider a five-percent reduction in all MP costs from their calibrated levels. This reduction
results in greater specialization across countries in innovation and production and real incomes rise on average by about two percent. Only one of the countries that experience a
decline in innovation suffers welfare losses, and they are very small. Contrary to popular
fears, we find that production workers gain everywhere, and it is innovation workers who
experience losses in countries that face a contraction in their innovation sector. Second, we
explore the implications of the integration of China to the world economy. The result is that
countries with good ties to China such as Japan and the United States follow what we could
refer to as the ”Apple model”: they specialize in innovation while China becomes their manufacturing hub. Countries that specialize further in innovation experience overall gains, and
production workers share in those gains, although by much less than innovation workers.
Finally, to explore the consequences of ”Brexit”, we consider an increase in trade and MP
costs between the U.K. and the European Union, and to explore President Trump’s suggestion of increasing taxes on firms that move part of their production abroad, we consider an
increase in outward MP costs for U.S. firms.
The mechanisms at work in our model have antecedents in the classic work on trade and
MP (see Markusen (2002)). This literature highlights four key ideas: (i) MP allows innovation (entry) to be geographically separated from production; (ii) countries differ in their
relative costs of innovation and production, which leads to specialization in one of these two
activities; (iii) the non-rivalry of technology within the firm allows multi-plant production;
and (iv) trade costs encourage, while MP costs discourage, multi-plant production. The incorporation of these features into a general-equilibrium trade model dates back to Helpman
(1984) and Markusen (1984).3 By modeling firm-level productivity in different countries as
2

Before proceeding, one conceptual issue is worth noting. In this paper we focus on MP as the vehicle
through which international specialization takes place, but there are alternative arrangements, such as the
licensing of technology and other contractual relationships such as outsourcing that do not involve ownership.
Our model is consistent with these mechanisms, but because there is little data on arm’s length offshoring we
can only measure the offshoring done within multinational firms.
3 Examples of work that most closely resembles our own are Markusen & Venables (1998) and Markusen
& Venables (2000) in which the authors analyze the interaction between comparative advantage in production
and innovation, trade costs, and plant and corporate fixed costs in a two-country, Heckscher-Ohlin-like setting.
Grossman & Helpman (1991) extend this framework to an endogenous growth setting in which the more efficient use of the world’s resources made possible by MP may affect the long-run growth rate in rich and poor
countries. Non-homothetic preferences together with home market effects determine specialization and foreign
investment patterns in high-quality or low quality goods in Fajgelbaum, Grossman & Helpman (2014).

coming from a multivariate distribution and by replacing plant-level fixed costs with marketing fixed costs, we gain the ability to construct a tractable, quantifiable, and multi-country
general equilibrium model that incorporates the most important mechanisms found in this
earlier work. Although adding plant-level fixed costs to our model is beyond the scope of
this paper, in the robustness Section we argue that their presence should not substantially
affect our qualitative results (i.e., cross country patterns) and we offer some thoughts on the
implications they would have for the quantitative effects (i.e., cross-country averages).
Our paper is closely related to a recent literature on trade and MP. Ramondo & Rodrı́guezClare (2013) also have a probabilistic representation of multi-country productivity and a
large number of countries, allowing for counterfactual analysis in a rich geographic setting. The key difference is that there is no innovation in their perfectly-competitive model.
Our monopolistic-competition framework is also related to a recent paper by Irarrazabal,
Moxnes & Opromolla (2013), which is the quantitative application of Helpman, Melitz &
Yeaple (2004). They focus on understanding the frictions that rationalize the export versus
MP decisions of Norwegian firms, but abstract from “export-platform MP” (any market can
be served only from a local affiliate or by exports from the firm’s home country) and fix firm
innovation locations and country wages by assumption. With a probabilistic structure similar to ours, Tintelnot (2017) allows for export-platform MP in a general-equilibrium model,
although again in this setting there is no innovation as firm entry is exogenous.
Our paper is also related to a literature that considers the movement of managerial or
knowledge capital from one country to another, interpreted as MP, while trade takes place
only as a way to transfer the returns to capital (see, for example, Burstein & Monge-Naranjo
(2009), McGrattan & Prescott (2010), McGrattan (2011), and Ramondo (2014)).4 The simplification on the trade dimension in these papers allows for a more detailed modeling of the
effect of specific policies, such as taxes on profits of foreign owned firms, as well as the transition path as countries open up to MP. Because they do not allow for increasing returns and
frictions to trade and MP, these papers have nothing to say about bilateral trade and MP
flows or about the role of HMEs and their related welfare implications.
Finally, by distinguishing between innovation and production activities, we make contact with a body of theory that emphasizes the effect of offshoring on the set of activities
done within a country and on real wages (e.g. Feenstra & Hanson (1999), Grossman &
Rossi-Hansberg (2008) and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2010)). By considering the impact of China’s
integration into world markets in our counterfactuals, our paper also makes contact with an

not been undertaken so far.

The Model

We consider a world economy comprised of i = 1, ..., N countries; one factor of production,
labor; and a continuum of goods indexed by ω ∈ Ω. Preferences are Constant Elasticity of
Substitution (CES) with elasticity of substitution σ > 1. The associated price index is given
by
Pi =

Z
ω ∈Ω

pi ( ω )

(1)

where pi (ω ) is the price of good ω in country i.
Each good ω is potentially produced by a single firm under monopolistic competition.
Firms can produce anywhere in the world with varying productivity levels as specified below. To the extent possible, we use index i to denote the firm’s country of origin (the source
of the idea), index l to denote the location of production, and index n to denote the country
where the firm sells its product. Firms that export from l to country n incur a marketing
fixed cost Fn in units of labor in the destination country, and an iceberg transportation cost
τ ln ≥ 1 with τ nn = 1. Firms originated in country i that produce in country l incur a productivity loss that we model as iceberg bilateral MP costs, γil ≥ 1, with γll = 1. These costs are
meant to capture various impediments that multinationals face when operating in a different economic, legal or social environment, as well as the various costs of technology transfer
incurred by multinationals in different production locations.
A firm from origin i can serve destination n by (i) producing in i and exporting to country
n, by (ii) opening an affiliate in country l 6= i, n and exporting from there to country n, or
by (iii) opening an affiliate in n and selling the good locally. Firms use constant returns to
scale technologies, with the marginal product of labor being firm and location specific. Formally, a firm is characterized by a productivity vector z = (z1 , z2 , ..., z N ), where zl determines
the firm’s productivity if it decides to produce in country l. These productivity vectors are
allowed to vary across firms, leading firms to make different choices regarding their production locations. Note that all heterogeneity across firms is associated with differences in
the productivity vector z, while the trade and MP costs, {τ ln } and {γil }, as well as wages
(introduced below), are common across firms.
We think of innovation as the process of creating differentiated goods, each one produced

7

by a single-product firm, and assume that doing so requires f ie units of labor. If Lie units of
labor are allocated to the innovation sector in country i, then the measure of goods created
in that country is Mi = Lie / f ie . Although this entails only product innovation, it is easy to
extend the model to allow for process innovation in such a way that none of the results that
we focus on are affected. As we show in the Online Appendix, if entrants can augment the
expected productivity of the firms they create by a proportion a at a cost that is a power
function of a, then part of the total innovation investment will be devoted to good creation,
and part to making firms more productive, with this breakdown of innovation into product
and process innovation being invariant to trade and MP.5
There are L̄i workers in country i. Workers are immobile across countries but mobile
across different activities (i.e., innovation, production and marketing) within each country.
We assume that workers are heterogeneous in their abilities across these activities. Each
worker is characterized by a productivity vector v ≡ (ve , v p ), where ve represents the number
of units of labor that the worker can supply to innovation and v p represents the number of
units of labor that the worker can supply to production or marketing. Workers can choose to
work in innovation, where the wage per unit of labor is wie , or production/marketing, where
p

the wage per unit of labor is wi . A worker with productivity vector v would work in the
p

innovation sector if and only if ve wie ≥ v p wi .

2.1

Firm’s Optimization

In this environment, firms face a simple optimization problem. First, for each market n, a
firm finds the cheapest location from where to serve that market. Second, the firm decides
what price to charge. Given our assumption on preferences, firms simply set prices equal to
p

e ≡ σ/ (σ − 1) over marginal cost. Letting ξ iln ≡ γil wl τ ln , the marginal cost of a
mark-up σ
firm from i producing in location l to serve market n is Ciln ≡ ξ iln /zl , and hence the price
charged in market n by a firm from i is
e min Ciln .
pin = σ
l

(2)

In Figure 3, we summarize how the price charged by a firm is determined by factors that are
firm specific, i.e. the firm’s productivity vector z, and by factors that depend on the country
5

Our model ignores innovation performed by multinationals’ foreign affiliates (see Fan (2017) for an extension of our model to R&D offshoring). This assumption seems reasonable given that most of the R&D is
still done in the multinationals’ home country. For example, according to BEA data for 2009, the parents of U.S.
multinationals accounted for 85 percent of its total R&D expenditure but only 70 percent of its value-added. See
also Bilir & Morales (2016), which concludes that the parent R&D is a substantially more important determinant
of firm performance than affiliate R&D.

profits. If those profits are higher than the fixed marketing cost then the firm chooses to
serve the market. Letting Xn be total expenditure in country n, the maximum unit cost under

Aggregation

Although the problem for each firm is simple, our goal is to obtain analytic expressions for
the aggregate variables that we can relate to the data while retaining key features of previous theories of international trade. To do so, we consider a multivariate extension of the
univariate Pareto distribution used in the Chaney (2008) version of Melitz (2003).
We assume that the productivity vector of firms in country i is randomly drawn from the

marginal distributions have Pareto tails – that is, for zl ≥ a > T

For the reminder of the paper, we make the following assumption.

distribution can be seen as a reformulation of an Archimedean copula of Pareto distributions. Specifically, the Archimedean copula 4.2.2 in Nielsen (2006) leads to the same function for the distribution as (4) in
the two-dimensional case if z1 and z2 are each distributed Pareto, except that the support would be implicitly

defined by ( T1 z1−θ ) 1−ρ + ( T2 z2−θ ) 1−ρ ≤ 1. This distribution cannot be directly extended to N ≥ 3 because the
copula is not strict (see Nielsen (2006)). Instead, we modify the support of the distribution to make it an N-box
e1/θ for all l. For a proof that (4) satisfies the requirements to be a distribution function as well

A 1 Til = Tie Tl .
This assumption is without loss of generality because variation in MP flows across country pairs can be equivalently generated by Til or by γil – we simply choose to load all of this

Tie as a measure of the quality of ideas in country i, or productivity in innovation. In turn, Tl
determines country l’s productivity in production.7 We will continue to write Til rather than

Tie Tl for notational convenience. Since Tie and f ie will have equivalent effects on all relevant
equilibrium variables, we henceforth assume that f ie = f e for all i.
To guarantee that for all pairs {i, n} there are firms from i that will decide not to serve
market n, we assume that the parameters of the model (e.g., marketing costs) are such that the
level of c∗n is low enough. Formally, we make the following assumption, which we maintain
throughout the rest of the paper:

The multivariate Pareto distribution together with this assumption allows us to characterize several important objects in the model, starting from the probability that a firm serves
a particular market from a certain production location at a unit cost below some c, and the
probability that firms from i serving market n decide to do so from production location l.

Proof: See Appendix A.
We use this Lemma to analyze the model’s implications for aggregate trade and MP flows.
Let Mi denote the measure of firms in country i, Miln denote the measure of firms from i that
serve market n from location l, and Xiln denote the total value of the associated sales. Using
the pricing rule in (2) and the cut-off rule in (3), we can compute Xiln by using (5) to obtain

Aggregate flows Xiln can be used to construct trade and MP shares. In particular, trade

shares are given by expenditure shares across production locations, λln
≡ ∑i Xiln / ∑i,k Xikn ,
while MP shares are given by production shares across firms from different origins, λilM ≡

∑n Xiln / ∑ j,n X jln . Letting Yl ≡ ∑i,n Xiln denote the value of all goods produced in country
l, recalling that Xn ≡ ∑i,l Xiln is total expenditure by consumers in country n, and using
expression (7), trade and MP shares can be written more succinctly as

(12)

where η ≡ 1/ (θ σ̃). Therefore, total profits made in country l are a constant share of the
value of production in country l, i.e. ∑i,n Πiln = ηYl .
We now turn to the aggregation across heterogeneous workers’ choices regarding their
12

labor supply. We assume that each worker’s endowment of units of labor in innovation
and production/marketing, ve and v p , are obtained as transformations of an independently
and identically distributed random variable drawn from a Fréchet distribution, similar to
Lagakos & Waugh (2013) and Hsieh, Hurst, Jones & Klenow (2011). More specifically, ve =
ue /Γ(1 − 1/κ ) and v p = u p /Γ(1 − 1/κ ), with ue and u p both drawn independently from
the distribution exp [−u−κ ], where κ > 1 and where Γ(.) is the Gamma function.8 From the
properties of the Fréchet distribution, this implies that the supply of labor units to innovation
and production/marketing activities in country i are given by

as κ → ∞, while the case of no mobility across sectors obtains in the limit as κ → 1, as
discussed further below.

then in innovation. Labor demand (in value) for production and marketing in country l is

To write the labor market clearing condition in innovation, note that profits net of marketing costs but gross of entry costs in country i are ∑l,n Πiln . Since the cost of entry is simply
given by labor hired for innovation, the zero-profit condition implies that we can think of
∑l,n Πiln as labor demand (in value) for innovation. Using (8) and (12) we can then write the
divide by Γ(1 − 1/κ ) so that when we take the limit when κ → 1 the aggregates defined below do not
blow up to infinity.

we (up to a constant determined by the numeraire).10
Equation (17) is one of the basic National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) identities,
namely that (in the absence of current-account imbalances, as we are assuming here) income
equals expenditure adjusted by trade and MP imbalances. The other NIPA identity is that
income equals output – this is obtained by adding up (15) and (16), which yields

sector (henceforth simply denoted as the innovation share) ri ≡ wie Lie / wi Li + wie Lie , which
9 We

use the expression ”aggregate trade and MP imbalances” rather than current account imbalances for
two reasons. First, because international transfers are included in the current account and hence would not
lead to current account imbalances in equilibrium. Second, and more importantly, because in the quantitative
analysis below we do not use data on current account imbalances to measure ∆i and instead do so by using the
calibrated model combined with net trade and MP flows.
10 It is worth noting that marketing fixed costs, F , do not enter the equilibrium equations (assuming that
n
they are high enough that Assumption A2 holds). The reason is that they affect all origins equally and hence
do not affect labor demand for production or innovation across countries. Of course, although these fixed costs
do not affect relative wages, they do affect variety and welfare in each country.

This is intuitive: a higher innovation share requires a higher wage in innovation relative to
production/marketing to induce the necessary reallocation of workers.11 Moreover, plugging this relative wage into (13) yields Lie = ri1−1/κ L̄i and hence
Mi = ri1−1/κ L̄i / f e ,

(23)

so that the measure of firms created is an increasing function of the innovation share.

2.4

Special Cases

In this Subsection, we explore a number of special cases of the model that we can characterize
analytically. These cases illustrate how, in the presence of MP, comparative advantage and
home market effects (HME) determine whether countries specialize in innovation or production. They also shed light on the basic forces behind the results of our quantitative analysis
in Section 4. For the rest of this Section, we assume no international transfers, i.e., ∆i = 0 for
all i.

equilibrium conditions further imply that ri = η for all i, that relative wages are given by

This implies that innovation is proportional to country size. Note that if κ → ∞ then Lie =

expression as the one derived by Arkolakis et al. (2008) in a Melitz model with endogenous
entry.12
2.4.2

A frictionless world - the role of comparative advantage

We now discuss the role of comparative advantage in leading to specialization in innovation or production. To make the analysis tractable, we focus on the case with homogenous workers (i.e., κ → ∞) in a frictionless world (i.e., τ ln = 1 and γil = 1, for all i, l, n).

Proof: See Appendix A.
The proposition states that countries with a relatively high ratio of productivity in innovation to production (i.e., countries that have a comparative advantage in innovation) will
(partially) specialize in innovation, as reflected in ri > η.
2.4.3

A two-country world - the role of home market effects

Our model exhibits HMEs, according to which the location of innovation and production
across countries is affected by country size, as well as trade and MP costs. To illustrate these
effects we consider a world with two countries, homogenous workers (i.e., κ → ∞) and
frictionless trade (i.e., τ ln = 1 for all l, n).
Proposition 2 Consider a two-country world, homogenous workers (i.e., κ → ∞) and frictionless
trade. Assume further that A1 = A2 and T1e = T2e . If either (i) L̄1 > L̄2 and γ12 = γ21 = γ > 1 or
(ii) L̄1 = L̄2 and γ12 < γ21 then in an interior equilibrium r1 > r2 .
Proof: See Appendix A.
The proposition shows the existence of a home market effect (HME) in innovation. Since
MP costs are positive but trade is frictionless, it makes sense to innovate in the country with
the larger labor force or with the higher inward MP costs.13

2.5

Welfare Implications

We now turn to the model’s implications for how trade and MP affect welfare in each country.
We are interested both in a country’s overall welfare, as measured by aggregate real income,
as well as real wages of workers in innovation and production.
2.5.1

Gains from Openness

We start by considering the overall gains from openness, defined as the change in aggregate
real income as we move from a counterfactual equilibrium with no trade and no MP to the
13 In

a previous version of this paper we also studied the case in which MP is frictionless but trade is costly,
showing the existence of an ”anti-HME” according to which the country that is larger or has a higher inward
trade cost tends to specialize in production rather than innovation – see the Online Appendix. We labeled this
effect a anti-HME because it runs counter to the logic of the HME, whereby the larger country specializes in the
activity with increasing returns, which here is innovation. We have chosen not to highlight the anti-HME here
because it turns out to be much weaker than the HME. For example, our numerical simulations show that in
the presence of both trade and MP costs, the large country tends to specialize in innovation. In particular, the
large country specializes in innovation whenever τ = γ > 1 and only specializes in production if γ is much
smaller than τ.

Rodrı́guez-Clare (2012). With MP, the gains from openness are composed of a direct and
an indirect effect, which we discuss in turn.
To understand the direct effect, consider first the simple case with ρ = 0, under which
the direct effect collapses to ( Xnnn /Xn )−1/θ . The term Xnnn /Xn is an inverse measure of
the degree of openness to trade and MP of country n. As one would expect, this measure

implies more openness than the typical measure of trade openness, since Xnnn /Xn < λnn

The first term on the right-hand-side captures the gains for country n from being able to
consume goods produced with foreign technologies (independently of where production
takes place), while the second term captures the gains for country n from being able to use
its own technologies abroad and import the goods back for domestic consumption. Given the
equilibrium flows Xiln , ρ > 0 leads to lower gains than ρ = 0 since correlated productivity
draws imply that the gains associated with the second term are not as important.
The indirect effect captures the gains or losses triggered by the net flow of profits due to
MP. Countries with net outward MP flows have a net inward flow of profits and rn > η—see
(20), implying a positive indirect effect; the opposite occurs in countries with net inward MP

captures how a net

effect of higher expenditures on the variety of goods available for domestic consumption.14

captures how a net inflow of profits is associated with higher entry (i.e.,

It is useful to compare our result for gains from openness with those in the perfectly competitive setting of Ramondo & Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013), where the gains from openness are
equal to the direct effect in (27).15 Thus, given trade and MP flows, the difference between
the two models is captured entirely by the indirect effect. Our monopolistic competition
setup then implies larger gains from openness than the perfect competition model of Ramondo & Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013) for countries with a net outflow of MP, while the opposite
is true for countries with a net inflow of MP.
2.5.2

Gains from Trade and Gains from MP

In addition to the gains from openness, we are also interested in the separate welfare effects
of trade and MP. The gains from trade, GT, are defined as the ratio of real income ( Xi /Pi )
between the calibrated equilibrium and a counterfactual equilibrium where there is no trade,
computed by letting τ ln → ∞ for l 6= n. Analogously, the gains from MP, GMP, are defined as
the ratio of real income between the calibrated equilibrium and a counterfactual equilibrium
with no MP, computed by letting γil → ∞ for i 6= l. In the counterfactual analysis with
the calibrated model in Section 4 we find that some countries (e.g., Turkey) lose from MP,
GMP < 1, while some countries (e.g., Brazil and China) lose from trade, GT < 1. We now
use simple cases of our model to shed light on these possibilities.
To understand how a country could lose from MP, it is useful to start by discussing a
simpler result, namely that a country can lose from unilateral MP liberalization (i.e., a decline
in inward MP costs). Consider a perfectly symmetric two-country world with frictionless
trade and homogeneous labor. As per Proposition 2, unilateral MP liberalization leads to
a decline in innovation, and – as shown in the online appendix – this leads to a decline in
welfare in the liberalizing country. This resonates with the well-known result of Venables
(1987) that unilateral liberalization can decrease welfare in a Krugman (1980) model with a
homogeneous-good sector, but the mechanisms are different. The welfare effect in Venables
(1987) is caused by the de-location of firms away from the liberalizing country and the resultelasticity, see Costinot & Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014)). The term 1/κ outside the square parenthesis comes from the
relationship between 1 − rn and Xn /wn Fn – see (A.23) in the Appendix.
15 Ramondo & Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013) did not derive this result explicitly, but it can be easily obtained from
the equilibrium equations of their model in the special case with only tradable goods and no intermediate
goods. The parameters θ and ρ in Ramondo & Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013) play analogous roles as in our model,
except that in their case those parameters are associated with a multivariate Fréchet distribution rather than a
multivariate Pareto distribution.

19

ing increase of its differentiated-goods price index. In contrast, in our model the price index
falls in the liberalizing country, but its welfare declines because of a deterioration in its terms
of trade caused by the expansion of employment in the production sector.
Can a country lose from multilateral MP liberalization? Resorting to numerical examples
in the simple case of two countries we find that this is indeed possible.16 The logic is the
same as the one outlined above: if MP liberalization triggers home market effects that push
innovation in country i below its no-MP level, i.e. ri < η, the deterioration of country i0 s
terms of trade may dominate the direct MP gains from the use of foreign ideas, implying
loses from MP, GMPi < 1.
To understand how a country could lose from trade, we turn again to the simple twocountry numerical example discussed above, and study the consequences of multilateral
trade liberalization in a setting where everything is symmetric except for MP costs. Assume
that inward MP costs are lower than outward MP costs for country 2 ( γ12 < γ21 ), so that
(from Proposition 2) country 1 specializes in innovation and country 2 specializes in production (r1 > η > r2 ). Compared to trade autarky, the equilibrium with finite and symmetric
trade costs entails a lower real wage in country 2. Interestingly, the relative wage of country
2 increases as we open up trade, but prices increase even more. Reminiscent of Venables
(1987), the de-location of innovation from country 2 to country 1 leads to an increase in the
price index in country 2 as it must now incur in MP costs for more of the ideas used domestically.
The previous discussion may suggest the possibility that a country loses from openness,
GOi < 1. But our numerical simulations for two countries never lead to such a result: even
if openness leads to a decline in innovation below its autarky value, i.e. ri < η, the direct
gains from openness always outweigh the indirect losses through a decline in innovation.
The key insight is that trade and MP are substitutes in the sense that, if one of these channels
is present, adding the other channel leads to small additional direct gains (see Ramondo &
Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013)) which may not be enough to compensate for the losses arising from
the fall in innovation.
2.5.3

Multinational Production and Real Wages in Production and Innovation

As mentioned in the Introduction, there is popular concern that globalization of production
may have a detrimental effect on production workers in rich countries. We use our model to
explore this possibility by looking at the effect of MP on the real wage of production workers
16 For the numerical example we set θ, σ and ρ

as calibrated in Section 3.2, together with κ → ∞, τ 12 = τ 21 = 3

and γ12 = 3 and γ21 = 4.

20

in a country that has a comparative advantage in innovation. To make the analysis tractable,
we focus on the comparative statics of moving from a situation with frictionless trade but
no MP to a situation with both frictionless trade and frictionless MP. The proposition below
establishes that there are indeed conditions under which production workers would be hurt
by such a move.
The proposition considers a special case in which productivity in production is the same
p 1/(1−ρ)
across countries, Ai ≡ Ti
/ L̄i = A for all i, so a ”rich” country here is one with a
relatively high Tie and hence a comparative advantage in innovation. We also assume that
ρ → 1, so that the gains from MP arising from differences in firm productivity across countries are not present in this case, making it more likely that MP will hurt production workers.
Finally, and most importantly, we assume that κ → 1, so that production workers are stuck
in production.
Proposition 3 Consider a world with no worker mobility across sectors (i.e., κ → 1), and ρ → 1.
Consider a switch from frictionless trade but no MP to frictionless trade and MP. (i) Suppose that
Ai = A for all i, Tje = T e for all j 6= i and Tie = T e + ε for ε small enough. In country i, the
switch increases the real wage for innovation workers and aggregate real income, but it increases real
production wages if and only if σ < θ̄ ≡

(1+ θ )2
.
1+ θ + θ 2

(ii) Suppose that Ai = 0 < A j for all i 6= j

and Tie = T e for all i. The switch increases aggregate real income, but it decreases the real wage for
innovation workers in country j.
Proof: See Appendix A.
Consider the first part of the proposition. By giving firms the ability to locate production
in low-production wage countries, MP exerts downward pressure on production wages in
rich countries. The same forces lead to an increase in innovation wages and total income,
and this increases the variety of goods available for consumption and decreases the price
index. If the elasticity of substitution is low enough, this increase in variety will have a
large downward effect on the price index, which more than compensates for the decrease in
nominal wages, allowing real production wages to increase.
Now consider the second part of the Proposition. MP liberalization that leads the innovation labor from a country to lose its monopoly power over an abundant supply of production
workers can have dramatic implications for innovation labor’s real wage. Intuitively, innovation labor is not differentiated by country and thus moving from no MP to free MP causes
innovation worker’s wages to equalize across countries while having less dramatic effects
on the cost of less substitutable production worker labor. The fall in the relative wage of innovation worker relative to production workers in the production worker abundant country
21

must swamp the efficiency gains associated with production reallocation is guaranteed by
the parameter restriction because of the required parameter restriction that θ > σ − 1.
As we will see below, even with the low value of κ = 2, our calibrated model implies
that production workers actually gain from MP liberalization in countries that further specialize in innovation. Instead, the losers are the innovation workers in some of the countries
that deepen their specialization in production as a consequence of MP liberalization. Not
surprisingly, low worker mobility is a key assumption for the result above. As we show
in the Appendix, with perfect worker mobility (i.e., κ → ∞), and assuming that condition

(25) holds so that the equilibrium in a frictionless world is an interior equilibrium, then a
move from frictionless trade but no MP to frictionless trade and frictionless MP increases the
common real wage paid to workers employed in the innovation and production sectors.

Model’s Calibration

The model’s calibration proceeds in two parts. In the first part we estimate two different
specifications of the gravity equation to obtain trade elasticities that are used as targets to
calibrate θ and ρ. In the second part we estimate trade and MP costs, as well as the parameters related to productivity in production and innovation, TiP and Tie . For trade and MP costs,
for which we assume they are symmetric, we target the bilateral trade and MP shares in the
data and implement a generalized version of the Head & Ries (2001) procedure. For the productivity parameters, we calibrate Tie by targeting a model-based measure of innovation and
p

Ti by targeting a measure of gross production in manufacturing, for each country.

3.1

Gravity Estimates

We use data on production, trade, and multinational sales to estimate two different gravity equations – the estimated trade elasticities will serve as targets for calibration. The first
gravity equation is defined over Xiln , the aggregate sales of firms that originate in country
i, produce in country l, and sell in country n. Because this gravity equation is defined over
trade flows conducted by firms that originate from a single origin, we refer to this equation
as “restricted gravity.” The second gravity equation is defined over Xln ≡ ∑i Xiln , the sales
to n from all firms operating in country l (as in the standard analysis). Because this gravity
equation is defined over trade flows by firms from all countries, we refer to this equation as
“unrestricted gravity.”
Details about the construction of the data and sources are in Appendix B.

22

3.1.1

Restricted Gravity

To estimate the restricted gravity equation, we use expression (7) and take logarithms to
obtain
ln Xiln = αril + µrin −

θ
ln τ ln ,
1−ρ

(29)

where αril and µrin are fixed effects.17 We rely on a measure of trade costs that is directly
related to a critical component of τ ln : the different tariffs applied to goods across production
locations. Specifically, we parameterize trade costs so that
ln Xiln = αril + µrin + βr ln(1 + tln ) + ∑ δrk [1|dln ∈ dk ] + Θr Hln + εiln ,

(30)

k

where tln is the simple average tariff applied by n on goods from l, [1|dln ∈ dk ] is an indicator
variable for distance between n and l—whose marginal effect on trade costs is given by δrk —,
and Hln is a vector of standard gravity controls, including distance dummies, dummies for
shared language and border, and an indicator variable that is equal to one if l = n to control for the variation in τ ln that is due to unmeasured trade costs, such as administrative and
r

information frictions, that local production avoids. The estimated coefficient β̂ has the structural interpretation of the parameter ratio θ/(1 − ρ) under the assumption that our measure
of tln captures some of the variation in trade costs between countries.
The data for Xiln with l 6= U.S. = i was constructed from the 1999 Benchmark Survey
of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on the operations of U.S. multinationals abroad.
Specifically, for each country l 6= U.S. we observe sales of U.S. multinationals in their host
country and their exports to the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and a
composite of fourteen European Union countries. The data for Xiln with l = U.S. = i was
constructed using a mixture of publicly available data and a confidential survey conducted
by the BEA on the activities of the U.S. affiliates of foreign firms.
In our sample on the global operations of U.S. multinationals, there are two forms of
variation in tln that identify βr . The first type of variation is due to the fact that firms that
open a local affiliate avoid all trade costs (i.e. tnn = 0), while firms from another country
generally must pay the applied MFN tariff rate. A second source of variation in tln is due to
the fact that some l and n belong to common preferential trade agreements (so that tln = 0),

country n, we can estimate (30) via ordinary least squares (OLS), as well as Poisson pseudomaximum-likelihood estimation (PPML).
3.1.2

Unrestricted Gravity

The “unrestricted” gravity equation has the same form as the “restricted” gravity equation,
but it is estimated on the bilateral sales of all firms located in country l selling to country n.
Specifically, we estimate
ln Xln = αul + µun + βu ln(1 + tln ) + ∑ δuk [1|dln ∈ dk ] + Θu Hln + viln .

(31)

k

We estimate (31) by OLS and PPML using data for manufacturing on trade volumes from
Feenstra, Romalis & Schott (2002), and total expenditure from various sources, for 1999. To
ensure comparability between the coefficients, we restrict the sample so that the country pair
coverage in the restricted and unrestricted samples is the same.
u

The coefficient estimate β̂ does not have a structural interpretation, but it still provides
information on the relative magnitudes of θ and ρ. When MP is not possible, all exports are
done by local firms so that the correlation of the firm productivity shocks determined by ρ
is irrelevant, and the coefficient on tariffs is equal to θ, as can be seen in (24). In the data
most exports are done by domestic firms so that Xln disproportionately contains information
u

r

on the operations of domestic firms. This fact suggests that β̂ is closer to θ than β̂ , which
in turn is equal to θ/ (1 − ρ). In summary, the model implies the following restriction on
r

u

parameters: β̂ = −θ/ (1 − ρ) < β̂ < −θ < 0.

The coefficient estimates β̂ and β̂ are reported in the first and second rows of Table 1, respectively – the estimates for the other coefficients all have the expected signs and are reported
in the Online Appendix. The first two columns report the results using OLS and differ only
in the way that bilateral tariffs tln are computed. The raw data is for tariffs at the industry
level, and we need to aggregate up to a single tariff without using endogenous country-level
trade shares as weights. In the first column the tariff is computed as a simple average of the
applied tariff across industries, while in the second column we use common weights given

is also some variation in constructed tariff measures due to the fact that developed countries extend
Generalized System of Preference tariffs to a number of developing countries.

by the value of global trade in the industry divided by the value of total global trade. Finally,
the third and fourth columns report results using PPML. Using PPML avoids possible bias
in OLS estimates because of heteroscedasticity, as explained by Silva & Tenreyro (2006), and
also allows us to use the dependent variable in levels, and hence, to include zero flows.
Consistent with the model, the four specifications yield a more negative trade elasticity
for the restricted regression relative to the unrestricted regression. A Wald test of the cross
equation restriction that the trade elasticity is the same for the restricted and unrestricted
gravity equations reveals that the difference is statistically significant at standard levels for
both of the OLS regressions but not for the PPML regressions. Based on the results in Table
r

u

1, we set targets of β̂ = 10 and β̂ = 5 in the calibration below. This estimate for the unrestricted trade elasticity is in the range of estimates obtained by the trade literature (such as
Romalis (2007), Simonovska & Waugh (2013), and Caliendo & Parro (2014)). Additionally,
Head & Mayer (2014) survey estimates of trade elasticities and concluded that their “preferred estimate is -5.03, the median coefficient obtained using tariff variation, ...”.
3.1.4

Robustness using instrumental variables

One concern that arises when tariffs are used to estimate trade elasticities is that tariffs are
endogenous. The exporter and importer fixed effects included in our baseline gravity equations ease this concern with respect to the absolute tariff level, but the concern remains that
the propensity for firms to export from country l to country n is correlated with the likelihood that l and n enter into a free trade agreement. Some trade agreements (e.g. US-Israel,
US-Colombia) are driven by political rather than commercial concerns, while others (e.g.
US-Canada) are driven by the volumes of trade between the involved countries that are in
turn driven by geography. The gravity controls in (30) proxy for this affinity. If, however,
25

other determinants of preferential trade agreements are excluded from (30), the trade elasticity may be biased. Given the importance of these trade elasticities for our calibration, we
consider an alternative instrumental-variable estimation.
Following Brainard (1997) and Helpman et al. (2004), we measure trade barriers as the
product of tariffs and freight and insurance costs (c.i.f./f.o.b), and consider as our dependent
variable the Head-Ries measure of unrestricted and restricted bilateral trade and MP flows
between the United States and those of its trade partners for which we have the necessary
freight-cost data. To address the endogeneity concern, we instrument trade costs with the
logarithm of distance, dummies for a border with the United States and for English as a
main language, and an index of infrastructure quality. A bivariate OLS regression produces
trade elasticities of -11 and -7 for the restricted and unrestricted gravity equations. In the
instrumental-variable regression, we obtain trade elasticities that are moderately higher at 14 and -9, respectively. These estimates are not statistically different in magnitude from those
obtain in our baseline specifications.

3.2

Calibration Procedure

We restrict our analysis to 26 countries for which we have good data for both trade, output
and MP. For trade we use the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) on manufacturing trade
flows from any country l to country n, including home sales, as the empirical counterpart of
bilateral trade in the model.19 Using this information, we construct the N × N matrix of trade
T
shares, λln
, and the N × 1 vector of aggregate (manufacturing) expenditures, Xn .

We use data from Ramondo, Rodrı́guez-Clare & Tintelnot (2015) on the gross value of
production for multinational affiliates from country i in country l to construct the empirical counterpart of bilateral MP flows and obtain an N × N matrix of production shares,
λilM . Since our quantitative analysis is restricted to the manufacturing sector, while our MP
data includes all MP flows, we rely on the following approximation. We observe that, for
the United States, MP flows in manufacturing account for approximately one half of overall MP flows, while manufacturing gross output is approximately one half of overall GDP
(according to our own calculations using BEA data, an average over 1996-2001). Thus, we
take overall MP flows divided by GDP as an approximation of manufacturing MP flows as a
share of gross production in manufacturing.20
19 See

Timmer (2012) and Costinot & Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014) for the description of the WIOD database.
Is this a plausible approximation for the remaining countries in our sample? We can check it for a subsample of 14 countries in our sample using data assembled by Alviarez (2015) containing the share of manufacturing (inward) MP for the period 2003-2011, and data for gross output in manufacturing as a share of GDP for
the years 1995, 2000 and 2005 from the OECD Inter-Country Input-Output Tables. The average ratio of these
20

26

We measure the N × 1 vector of labor endowments, L̄i , as equipped labor, from Klenow &
Rodrı́guez-Clare (2005), multiplied by the share of employment in the manufacturing sector,
from UNIDO. This is also the variable we refer to as country size. All the data refer to an
average over 1996-2001.
Table 2 summarizes the calibrated parameters and each of the targeted moments in the
data. We set θ/ (1 − ρ) = 10 to match the restricted gravity elasticities shown in Table 1. To
disentangle ρ from θ, we use the predictions of the model regarding the unrestricted gravity
regression coefficient. As described below, this leads to θ = 4.5 and ρ = 0.55. We set σ = 4,
a common value in the literature that implies a markup of 33 percent, which is on the high
end of the range of estimates for markups in manufacturing across the OECD – see Martins,
Scarpetta & Pilat (1996) and Domowitz, Hubbard & Petersen (1988) The calibrated values for
θ and σ imply that η = 16.7, which under no MP is also the innovation share. As discussed
further below, this is not far above an estimate of the returns to intangible capital as a share
of GDP in the U.S.
We also need a value for κ, which determines the elasticity of labor supply to innovation
vs production with respect to the relative wage we /w p . We have some guidance from recent
quantitative work for the value of this parameter in related contexts. In a model where κ
determines the wage elasticity of labor supply for workers across occupations, Hsieh, Hurst,
Jones & Klenow (2013) estimate a value of 2, while Burstein, Morales & Vogel (2016) estimate
a lower value of 1.8. Using data from the United States and a model where κ determines the
wage elasticity of labor supply across manufacturing sub-sectors, Galle, Rodrı́guez-Clare &
Yi (2015) also find a value of 2. We thus set κ = 2 in our baseline calibration, and experiment
with an alternative high value of 5 in Section 5.1.
The calibration of the rest of the parameters proceeds in three steps. The first step computes the matrices of τ’s and γ’s by using the trade and MP shares from the data. Our
procedure is an extension of the approach in Head & Ries (2001) to a setting with MP. Head
& Ries (2001) show that in a gravity model of trade, if one assumes that trade costs are symmetric, τ nl = τ ln , and there are no domestic trade costs (i.e., τ nn = 1 for all n) then trade costs

can be obtained as τ̂ ln
= (λln
λnl )/(λllT λnn
)
. For ρ = 0 the Head-Ries method can be
used in our model to estimate trade and MP costs, but for ρ > 0 this is no longer the case.
However, as we show in Appendix C, given data on bilateral trade and MP flows, our model
determines all trilateral flows, Xiln . Imposing symmetry on trade and MP costs as well as
τ ll = γll = 1 for all l, and given values for ρ and θ, we can then use these trilateral flows to
construct estimates of τ ln and γil .21

costs from l to n. Parameter values for TiP and Tie refer to averages across N countries, relative to values for
the United States. Parameter values for τ ln and γil refer to averages across the N × ( N − 1) country pairs.
Standard deviations are in parenthesis.

The second step of the calibration procedure involves calibrating the productivity paramp

eters Tl and Tie . We normalize Tie = Ti = 1 for i = USA and then pick Tie and Ti so that
the model-implied values for innovation shares ri and observed gross manufacturing output
levels Yi (both relative to the U.S.) exactly match the corresponding values computed using
(20) and our data on trade, MP, and aggregate expenditures (all for manufacturing). Table 3
p

shows the calibrated values for Ti and Tie .22
The third and final step of the algorithm requires estimating an unrestricted gravity regression in which the dependent variable is the model-generated trade share from l to n and
the regressors are the calibrated trade costs from l to n, as well as exporter and importer fixed
effects. For θ = 4.5 and ρ = 0.55, which satisfy our target of θ/ (1 − ρ) = 10, this regression
yields an unrestricted trade elasticity of 5.7 (s.e. 0.15), just slightly above the targeted 5 in the
data.
of trade elasticities in Section 3.1, is tariffs. We can extend our generalized Head-Ries procedure to allow for
tariffs and calculate the symmetric part of trade costs as a residual. The results are virtually unchanged relative
to those in our baseline, a result that is not surprising given the very low bilateral tariffs prevailing between the
countries in our sample.
22 The identification strategy we use is in some aspects related to the one in Burstein & Monge-Naranjo (2009).
p
Our distinction between Ti and Tie is related to their notion of country-embedded productivity that affects any
firm producing in country l, and firm-embedded productivity that affects all firms from country i, respectively.
One difference stems from the fact that, whereas in Burstein & Monge-Naranjo (2009) there are only one-way
MP flows, in our case we have two-way MP flows. Thus, instead of using something like ∑i∈ R λilM , with R being
the set of rich countries, we use net MP flows as one of the key moments for calibrating T e and T p . Additionally,
while Burstein & Monge-Naranjo (2009) use data on taxation of foreign profits to disentangle MP costs from Tie ,
we impose symmetry and compute γ0 s using the generalized Head-Ries procedure.

Data

Notes: Imports and exports for country n are normalized by manufacturing absorption in country n. Outward (inward)
MP shares refer total sales of foreign affiliates from (into) country n normalized by gross production in country n in the
model (GDP in country n in the data).

We next assess the fit of the calibrated model. Figure 5 plots inward and outward trade
and MP flows, respectively, at the country level. Trade flows are normalized by absorption in
manufacturing in country n, both in the model and the data, while MP flows are normalized
by gross output in the model and GDP in country n in the data. Note that aggregate shares
were not directly targeted by our calibration procedure. The figure reveals that the model
29

delivers slightly higher MP outward shares and export shares than the ones observed the
data.23
Figure 6 plots bilateral trade and MP shares, model vs data. These variables in the data
are an input into the model’s calibration, but given the symmetry assumption on trade and
MP costs, it is not the case that the model exactly matches all the elements of the bilateral
flow matrices; in other word, ours is an ”over-identified” procedure, with more targeted
moments ( 2 × N × ( N − 1)) than parameters (2 × N × ( N − 1)/2) to estimate. The figure
reveals that the calibrated model overall does a good job in matching the bilateral data: The
model captures more than 90 percent of the variation observed in the data in bilateral trade
and MP shares, respectively. Overall, the average bilateral MP share in the data is 0.012
against 0.014 in the model, while the average for bilateral trade share in the data is 0.013
against 0.010 in the model.24
3.3.2

Innovation, Comparative Advantage and HMEs.

We next discuss the role of comparative advantage and HMEs in explaining the cross-country
variation in innovation shares. Our assumption that trade and MP costs are symmetric
becomes critical here – without such an assumption, we could not identify Tie relative to
p 1/(1−ρ)
Ai ≡ Ti
/ L̄i .
The difference between ri in column 3 in Table 3 and η = 0.167 tells us the specialization
pattern for each country according to our baseline calibration: countries with ri > η are
specialized in innovation (such as the United States, Denmark, and Benelux), and countries
with ri < η are specialized in production (such as China, Ireland, and Mexico).
To isolate the role of HME, vis-a-vis the role of comparative advantage, we use the calip

1− ρ

brated model and shut down comparative advantage by setting Tie = 1 and Ti = L̄i

for

all i. Column 4 in Table 3 shows the resulting innovation share, ri , and compares it with the
one from our baseline calibration in column 3, in both cases shutting down trade and MP
deficits by setting ∆i = 0 for all i. The difference between ri in column 4 and η isolates the
effects of HMEs on innovation in country i, with the difference between ri in columns 3 and
4 revealing the effects of comparative advantage.
23 On average, outward MP shares are 0.23 in the model, and 0.19 in the data, while inward shares are, respec-

tively, 0.35 and 0.30. For export and import shares, the model delivers averages of 0.26 and 0.26, respectively,
while the data delivers average of around 0.32 and 0.33, respectively.
24 We should note that we do not evaluate the quantitative predictions of our model with respect to income
distribution across and within countries as the necessary data are not available for the large number of countries
in our dataset. A methodology for computing model-consistent measures of wages by occupation can be found
in Burstein et al. (2016), who document a rise in the relative wages of occupations that are likely associated with
innovation and firm entry.

Notes: Imports and exports from country l to n are normalized by manufacturing absorption in country n. MP
flows from i to l are normalized by gross production in country n in the model (GDP in country n in the data).

In general, HMEs push small countries such as Hungary and Ireland towards specialization in production, while they push large countries such as the United States to specialize
in innovation. But the neighborhood also matters and HMEs still lead to specialization in
innovation in some small countries (e.g., Benelux). Of course, small countries with adverse
HMEs may nevertheless be specialized in innovation thanks to comparative advantage (i.e., a
relatively high Tie /Ai ) – we can see that this is the case for Denmark and Finland by comparing columns 3 and 4. On the contrary, and quite surprisingly, the United States is revealed to
have a comparative advantage in production – if it had comparative advantage in innovation
then the value for rUS should be higher in column 3 than in 4.
It is important to note that our symmetry assumption on trade and MP costs is only necessary to disentangle the role of comparative advantage and HMEs in driving countries to
specialize in innovation or production – this assumption is not necessary for counterfactual
analysis. In fact, in a previous version of this paper (see Arkolakis, Ramondo, Rodrı́guezClare & Yeaple (2013)) we developed a version of the ”just-identified” calibration procedure
as in Dekle et al. (2008) that does not rely on the symmetry assumption. This alternative
31

calibration procedure does not identify the productivity parameters T e and T p , but its counterfactual implications are very similar to those we get from our symmetry-based calibration
below.
3.3.3

Additional Implications

Innovation shares. Figure 7 shows the innovation share in the model and in the data relative
to the United States. The innovation share in the model is ri from Table 3, while in the data
this share corresponds to employment in R&D as a share of total employment, from UNIDO,
as an average over the nineties.

Data, relative to the U.S.

Notes: Innovation shares refer to R&D employment shares: in the model, the (equilibrium) variable r, calculated
with exogenous current account imbalances, ∆ 6= 0 (the variable in column 3 of Table 3); in the data, R&D
employment as a share of total employment, from UNIDO, an average over the nineties. Shares are relative to
the United States.

There is a strong positive association between the two variables in spite of the fact that
R&D data was not used in the calibration of the model. This positive association suggests
that the model does a good job in capturing the observed relationship between trade, MP
and innovation. On the other hand, the innovation shares in the data and the model are quite
different in levels – the observed share of labor employed in R&D is an order of magnitude
lower than the model’s implied share, which revolves around 17 percent. One reason for
this discrepancy is that whereas our calibrated model is for manufacturing, the R&D data in

Figure 7 is for the whole economy. R&D shares in manufacturing are higher – for example,
the ratio of R&D to value added in the United States is 2.7 percent for the whole economy,
but 8.7 percent for manufacturing. Another reason for the discrepancy in levels is that R&D
in the data captures only a small part of what constitutes innovation in the model. The
innovation share implied by the model is of the same order of magnitude to the 15 percent
share of income accrued to intangible capital—which includes not only R&D expenditures,
but also marketing expenditures—in the United States (average for 2000-03), as calculated
by Corrado, Hulten & Sichel (2009).25
Trade and MP costs. The estimated trade and MP costs should correlate to geographic
variables such as bilateral distance. To evaluate this relationship we regress the logarithm
of estimated trade and MP costs on an indicator variable for distance bins, as in the gravity
regressions above, border and language dummies, and origin and destination fixed effects.
Except for the estimates of the border dummy on trade costs, the coefficients are all significant at the one-percent level and have the expected signs: Trade and MP costs increase with
distance and are lower for country pairs that share a language.
Bridge MP. As discussed above, our calibration procedure implies a unique mapping
from observed bilateral trade and MP shares to simulated trilateral flows, Xiln . We now
assess the ability of our model to predict these trilateral flows for the United States (i = USA),
which is the only case for which we have the necessary data. Notice that this data was not
use in the calibration of trade and MP costs.
Following Ramondo & Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013), we refer to MP sales sold outside of the
local market as bridge MP (BMP) flows, since firms from i use l as a bridge to reach another
location n. In turn, BMP shares are defined as the ratio of BMP to total MP flows from i in
25 Corrado,

Haskel, Lasinio & Iommi (2014) extend their analysis of the income share of intangible capital to
other OECD countries besides the U.S. For a subset of 18 countries that are in both our sample and in theirs, the
correlation between our innovation share and their computed income share of intangible capital is 0.46.

l (∑n6=l Xiln / ∑n Xiln ). The BMP shares predicted by the model are lower than the ones in
the data. Across all production locations for U.S. multinationals, the average BMP share in
the model is 0.054, while this is 0.36 in the data.26 Predicted BMP flows are low because in
the calibrated model multinationals tend to serve foreign markets mostly through exports or
MP rather than BMP. This is a consequence of the relatively high value of ρ in our calibration
(i.e., ρ = 0.55), which is dictated by the large gap between the estimated trade elasticities
in the restricted and unrestricted gravity equations. Results are very different if we simply
imposed ρ = 0, as we explain in detail in Section 5.1.
Digging deeper into the variation in BMP, we find that the correlation between predicted
BMP by country and destination for U.S. firms (i.e. Xiln for i = U.S.) is nearly one when
compared with the actual data. A large part of this is due to gravity: sales from large countries to large countries tend to be large. To control for gravity we compare log ( Xiln /Yl Xl ) as
predicted by the model and as observed in the data. For ρ = 0.55, the correlation is roughly
0.45, whereas for ρ = 0 the correlation falls to roughly 0.40. The better fit of the data to the
micro patterns of BMP is to be expected as the trade elasticities in the aggregate data imply
a ρ that is greater than zero.

Counterfactual Experiments

Armed with our calibrated model, we perform a series of counterfactual experiments to understand the effects of openness on innovation and welfare across and within countries. All
our counterfactuals are performed assuming that the aggregate trade and MP deficits are
zero (i.e. by setting ∆i = 0).
We first calculate the gains from openness as well as the gains from trade and the gains
from MP, according to the definitions in Section 2.5. We then compute the effect of a decline
in MP costs on innovation, real income, and real wages of workers in the innovation and
production sectors. Next, motivated by its recent emergence as a key location for manufacturing production, we analyze the effects of the integration of China to the world economy
through various exercises. We finish with a couple of exercises designed to explore the likely
implications of Brexit and a tax on U.S. firms that set up production locations abroad.
Before presenting our results, we acknowledge that the absence of non-tradable and intermediate goods in our calibrated model is likely to bias the overall magnitude of our quantitative results on welfare. As shown in Alvarez & Lucas (2007) the inclusion of non-tradable
26 We

use the data published by the BEA website on local sales, sales to the United States, and sales to third
countries of affiliates in manufacturing, by country. We choose the year 1999 for consistency with the BMP data
used for the gravity estimates and because this is a benchmark survey year for which less data are imputed.

Note: The gains from openness refer to changes in real expenditure between autarky and the calibrated equilibrium. The direct and indirect effects refer to the first and second terms,respectively, on the right-hand side
of (27). The gains from trade (MP) refer to changes in real expenditure between an equilibrium with only
MP (trade) and the calibrated equilibrium with both trade and MP. Changes are with respect to the baseline

goods lowers, while the inclusion of tradable intermediate goods increases, the gains from
trade, with the overall effects reducing the gains from trade by half. The effect should be
milder for the gains from from since MP is feasible in the non-tradable sector (see Ramondo
& Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013)). Although these considerations will affect the levels of welfare
gains, they should not affect our results on the distribution of trade and MP gains (and loses)
across countries, the impact of trade and MP on innovation, and the distribution of gains
between production and innovation workers within countries.

4.1

The Gains from Openness

Table 5 presents the gains from openness decomposed into the direct and indirect effects,
as discussed in Section 2.5, as well as the gains from trade and MP, for a list of selected
countries – the table with all countries is in the Online Appendix. All countries gain from
openness, and these gains are mostly driven by the direct effect. For countries that specialize
in production, the direct effect is partially offset by a negative indirect effect – for example,
Ireland has direct gains of 118 percent but indirect losses of 13 percent, resulting in a net
overall gain of 90 percent.
The gains from MP and trade tend to be low, relative to the gains from openness, because
36

trade and MP are substitutes: once an economy has access to either trade or MP, then adding
the other channel does not generate large additional gains. Table 5 shows that some countries
with ri < η actually lose from trade or MP. Focusing again on Ireland, we see that it experiences loses from trade of one percent, but gains from MP of 28 percent. The fact that some
countries lose from trade or MP stands in contrast to Ramondo & Rodrı́guez-Clare (2013),
where gains from trade and gains from MP were always positive. As explained in Section
2.5.2, if inward MP costs are low relative to outward MP costs, lowering trade costs from
infinity to their calibrated values (while leaving MP costs at their calibrated levels) would
lead to a reallocation of resources from innovation to production, a de-location effect that
may increase prices as more ideas used in production must now bear the MP costs. Similarly, lowering MP costs from infinity to their calibrated values (while leaving trade costs at
their calibrated levels) would lead to a decline in innovation, triggering a deterioration in the
country’s terms of trade.

4.2

The Gains from MP Liberalization

We now quantify the overall gains and distributional effects from lowering all MP barriers
by five percent. Table 6 shows the percentage changes for each country in innovation shares
p

(ri ), real expenditure (Xi /Pi ), real wage in production (wi /Pi ), and real wage in innovation
(wie /Pi ).
MP liberalization generates a large reallocation of innovation across countries. For example, r increases more than ten percent in Benelux, but falls by more than 11 percent in
Australia. These changes result from a combination of forces. When trade and MP costs decrease, we should see countries specializing according to their comparative advantage, but
with positive trade and MP costs, HMEs are magnified, or weakened, as barriers decrease.
In addition, there are third country effects: When a country is close to another country that
has strong comparative advantage, MP liberalization may lead to a decline in its innovation
share. In general, we should observe reallocation towards innovation in countries with r > η,
and the opposite in countries with r < η. However, it is also important to consider whether
innovation shares are low because of comparative advantage or HMEs. For instance, Ireland has r < η, but when MP gets liberalized, it reallocates resources toward the innovation
sector. This is because Ireland has a comparative advantage in innovation.
It is worth noting that effects of MP liberalization are highly non-linear. For instance, the
strong increase in innovation in Benelux is caused by the fact that γ is already low in that
country; effects would be weaker if γ were high.27
27 In a symmetric world, we would not observe this non-linear effects; the gains from MP liberalization would

Note: MP liberalization refers to a five-percent decrease in all MP costs with respect to the baseline calibrated
values. The variables are: the innovation share, r; real expenditure, X/P; real wage per efficiency unit in the
production sector, w p /P; real wage per efficiency unit in the innovation sector, we . Percentage changes are with
respect to the baseline calibrated equilibrium without trade and MP imbalances, ∆ = 0.

As measured by changes in aggregate real expenditure, countries experience average welfare gains of 1.93 percent from MP liberalization. The top winner is Benelux, with gains of
5.6 percent, while Turkey experiences a small loss. As explained in Section 2.5, aggregate
loses arise because of the reallocation of resources from innovation to production and the
associated terms of trade, or de-location, effects.
The distributional impact of MP liberalization are also shown in Table 6. The real wage
for production workers increases with MP liberalization in all the countries in our sample. In
contrast, changes in the real wage for innovation workers tend to fall with MP liberalization
in countries which are net recipients of MP (i.e., with r < η). For example, real wages in
innovation decrease by 3.4 percent in Mexico and by around 2.5 percent in China. More
broadly, real wages in innovation tend to increase by more than real wages in production in
countries with net MP outflows (i.e., with r > η), whereas the opposite happens in countries
with net MP inflows (i.e., with r < η).

The Rise of the East

Arguably the single most important recent event relevant to the questions addressed in this
paper is the emergence of China as a major center for manufacturing production. We analyze
be, as a first-order approximation, the product of the decline in γ and MP flows.

how this may have affected innovation patterns across countries, as well as its overall welfare
effects and distributional implications. Following up on the theoretical discussion in Section
2.5, we pay particular attention to the possibility of a negative effect on production workers
in rich countries.

0
from the United States into China (i.e., γUSA,CHN
= 1). Table 7 presents the results for China,

the United States, Japan, Mexico and Ireland, using the baseline calibrated model.
China in autarky. Moving China back to autarky implies a reduction in the innovation
share for countries that are specialized in innovation. For example, r falls by 2.5 percent in
the United States and almost two percent in Japan. On the contrary, Mexico experiences an
increase in r. This might seem counterintuitive: if Mexico and China compete for inward MP,
then it would be natural to expect China’s disappearance from the scene to lead to more MP
39

towards Mexico, causing deeper specialization in production and a decline in r. The positive
effect arises because innovation is a non-rival activity, so that its decline in the United States
leads to the creation of fewer U.S. firms and lower MP flows to China and other locations.
Aggregate welfare falls everywhere and, as implied by the theory, the relative wage of
innovation workers (i.e., we /w p ) increases wherever there is an increase in the innovation
share. In fact, the large increase in we /w p in China implies that innovation workers benefit
from moving to autarky. The real wage for production workers falls even in countries that
experience a decline in r, such as the United States.
Unilateral MP liberalization into China. The second counterfactual exercise involves a
ten-percent decline in MP costs from all countries into China. This leads China to specialize
even more in production while the United States and Japan further specialize in innovation.
In turn, higher innovation in the United States increases outward MP to Mexico, which deepens its specialization in production.
China experiences gains of 0.75 percent, and the other countries in Table 7 also gain, but
some countries experience modest aggregate losses, such as Austria and Turkey (not shown).
These are countries for which innovation activities decline, and hence, by the results in Section 2.5, they are candidates for welfare losses caused by the strengthening of HMEs due to
MP liberalization in China. Specifically, countries that are initially well linked to China benefit disproportionally from the new MP opportunities generated by China’s liberalization,
leading to a reallocation of innovation toward these countries and away from countries with
weak links to China, who may then suffer welfare losses.
Turning to the distributional implications, the gains from MP liberalization in China are
captured by production workers, who see their real wage increased by almost two percent,
while innovation workers actually experience losses of more than five percent. Contrary to
popular fears, production workers gain in the United States, but their gains are less than one
fifth of those of workers in the innovation sector.
Frictionless MP from the United States into China. The complete removal of MP frictions from the United States into China has major effects all over the world. First, there is
a dramatic reallocation of innovation from China to the United States. Second, the increase
in innovation in the United States leads to a strong displacement of innovation away from
countries with strong links to the United States, such as Ireland and Mexico. Third, there is
a decline in innovation activities (and the real wage for innovation workers) in other highinnovation countries, such as Japan, for two reasons: these countries face much worse conditions for doing MP in China as production wages there increase by almost 45 percent thanks
to the higher demand for labor by U.S. multinational firms; and the increase in innovation

40

activities in the United States leads their multinational firms to open foreign subsidiaries
everywhere, extending the upward pressure in production wages to—and reducing the incentives for innovation in—the rest of the world.
Importantly, although there is a large reallocation of production by U.S. multinational
firms to China, the fear that this may hurt U.S. workers does not materialize in our calibrated
model: both production and innovation workers in the United States experience increases in
their real wage.

4.4

The Fall of the West

Motivated by Brexit, we first use our model to quantify the effects of a five-percent increase
in bilateral trade and MP costs between the United Kingdom and the countries in our sample that belong to the European Union. To highlight the separate role of the increase in MP
costs, we perform the exercise in two steps: we first increase only trade costs by five percent, and then we increase simultaneously trade and MP costs by five percent. We find that
while increasing barriers to trade with the EU would reduce real expenditure in the U.K. by
a percentage point, also increasing barriers to MP would more than triple the real expenditure losses. The innovation share would fall by 2.5 percent, and workers in the production
and innovation sector would experience decreases in their real wage of 1.4 and 2.7 percent,
respectively. All EU members would lose from Brexit—particularly Ireland—except for Italy
that would experience small welfare gains.
Next, motivated by the idea of imposing taxes on U.S. firms that reallocate (parts of) their
production process to foreign locations, we consider a unilateral increase of 20 percent in
0
outward MP costs from the United States (i.e., γUSA,l
/γUSA,l = 1.20, for all l 6= USA). As

shown in the Online Appendix, this causes a reduction in the U.S. innovation share of almost 20 percent. Both workers in the production and innovation sectors would lose, but the
losses of workers in the latter sector would be more than six-time larger. Ireland and Mexico would both experience increases in their innovation shares but suffer aggregate welfare
losses. Overall, countries with net positive MP flows (i.e., r > η) tend to gain, while net
recipients of MP (i.e., r < η) tend to lose.

Sensitivity Analysis

In this Section we present results for alternative calibrations with values for ρ and κ that
differ from our baseline calibration, and discuss the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion
of fixed costs of operating plants in additional locations.
41

5.1

Alternative Calibrations

Two parameters have outsized roles in shaping the model’s quantitative implications. The
parameter ρ governs the heterogeneity of firms’ productivity draws across production locations and so determines the efficiency gains associated with the relocation of production
internationally. The parameter κ governs the heterogeneity of a worker’s efficiency draws
across innovation and production and so determines the extent to which countries can be
induced to specialize. In this section, we contrast the fit and the welfare implications of alternative parameterizations of ρ and κ with those of our benchmark calibration. The supporting
tables can be found in the Online Appendix.
To illustrate the role of ρ we reconsider the model’s fit and counterfactual predictions
T
when ρ = 0. Under this parameterization, it is easy to show that Xiln = λilM λln
Xn , i.e., the

aggregate export behavior of the foreign affiliates mimics the export behavior of domestic
firms. There are two immediate implications for the model fit under this parameterization.
First, the model will not generate trade elasticities that differ between restricted and unrestricted gravity (they are both equal to θ), so it cannot match the target estimates from Section
3.1. Still, upon recalibrating trade and MP costs, the model calibrated with ρ = 0 does as well
as that calibrated with ρ = 0.55 in matching the observed trade and MP flows. Second, the
average BMP share predicted by the model rises from 5.5 to 27 percent, bringing it much
closer to the 36 percent observed in the data.28 As explained in Section 3.3.3, however, the
cross-country pattern of BMP is better captured by the model with ρ = 0.55, as also implied
by our aggregate estimates of the gravity elasticities.
The cross-country pattern of the various effects we have focused on are not significantly
different across the calibrations with ρ = 0 and ρ = 0.55. Specifically, between the two
calibrations in the country-level gains from openness, gains from trade and gains from MP
are 0.93, 0.85 and 0.92, respectively, while the analogous correlation in the percentage change
in r , X/P, w p /P and we /P, are 0.88, 0.96, 0.96, and 0.86, respectively. Some differences
emerge in cross-country averages: the average gains from openness are 13 percent under
ρ = 0, lower than the 25 percent for the case with ρ = 0.55, the average gains from MP are
slightly lower (6 rather than 7 percent), the average gains from trade are slightly higher (5
rather than 4 percent), and the average gains from MP liberalization are lower (1.4 vs 1.9
percent).
Why is it that the calibration with ρ = 0 delivers lower gains from openness than with
ρ = 0.55? Since the difference arises almost entirely from the direct gains, we can focus on
28 This

difference in the average BMP share between data and model is close to the difference in fit obtained
by Tintelnot (2017) in the baseline calibration of his model with plant-level fixed costs (50 percent in the data vs
39.4 percent in the model).

.

Thus, we can focus on the implied value of the share Xnnn /Xn under ρ = 0 and ρ = 0.55
to understand the difference in the gains from openness between the two calibrations. Since
BMP shares tend to be higher under ρ = 0 but both models are calibrated to be consistent
with the same trade and MP shares, it must be that domestic firms tend to export less and
produce more for the domestic market, implying a higher Xnnn /Xn and lower gains from
openness.
To illustrate the role of the parameter κ, we consider the alternative value of κ = 5.29 Not
surprisingly, as κ increases countries respond to shocks by becoming more specialized. The
results for Benelux illustrate the point clearly: the increase in the innovation share triggered
by MP liberalization increases from 11 percent with κ = 2 to almost 20 percent with κ = 5.

5.2

Plant-Level Fixed Costs

As mentioned in the Introduction, we have departed from the literature by assuming that
there are no fixed costs involved in setting up plants in additional locations. This approach
has important advantages: firm decisions aggregate up nicely so that we have analytical results for comparative statics and welfare; the model generates a gravity equation for trade
flows by firms from one home country – our restricted gravity equation; and the calibration
is transparent, as we can recover key restrictions on parameters with our restricted gravity equation and compute trade and MP costs from our extended Head and Ries approach.
Still, it is important to discuss how the absence of a proximity-concentration tradeoff (i.e.
incurring trade costs, but concentrating production in one location, or incurring a plant-level
fixed cost to replicate production in another location closer to consumers) may be affecting
our results.
As we show in the Online Appendix, under the special case with ρ = 0 and if plantlevel fixed costs are not too high relative to marketing costs (a generalization of a condition
imposed by Helpman et al. (2004)), then allowing for such fixed costs would not affect any of
the conclusions we have derived in this paper. In essence, in this case, all that the plant-level
this case differs only in the specification of the labor market, the implied trade and MP costs, T e ’s,
and
as well as the goodness of fit of the calibrated model, and the values of ρ and θ, are common across
specifications.
29 Because

T p ’s,

43

fixed costs do is to increase the productivity cutoff for selling in the market where the plant
is located, exactly as if the marketing cost for selling there were higher. Since marketing
costs have no effect on our counterfactuals, it follows that adding fixed costs does not affect
them either. We acknowledge that the case with ρ = 0 is quite special, but the isomorphism is
important because it shows that the magnitude of any possible change caused by introducing
plant-level fixed costs depends on how far ρ is from zero.
For ρ > 0 the isomorphism breaks down and one must deal with firms facing a discrete
choice problem with 2 N combinations of production locations to choose from. Such firmlevel decisions do not aggregate up into a set of equilibrium equations that we can directly
use to conduct comparative statics, and the analysis must be done through simulation methods. Tintelnot (2017) addresses this challenging problem in the context of a model with a
probabilistic structure that is similar to ours, but without innovation or marketing costs.30
He calibrates the model to match moments associated with German firm-level data as well
as aggregate trade and MP flows. One key result of that paper is that BMP increases with
plant-level fixed costs. This is because those fixed costs lead to fewer and larger firms, with
a lower average number of production plants and higher BMP.
Adding plant-level fixed costs to our model, computing the equilibrium by following
the techniques in Tintelnot (2017), and calibrating the model to make it consistent with the
restricted and unrestricted trade elasticities as well as the average BMP shares is an important
issue for future research. Here we can only offer the following conjecture: since either the
case of positive plant-level fixed costs or the case with no such costs and ρ = 0 imply higher
BMP shares relative to our baseline calibrated model with ρ = 0.55 and no fixed costs, then
their effect on counterfactual implications may be similar. In that sense, the results discussed
above for the alternative calibration with ρ = 0 may be informative about the effect of adding
plant-level fixed costs.

Conclusion

The decline in the costs of multinational production (MP) has allowed some countries to specialize in innovation and others to specialize in the production of goods and services created
elsewhere. To quantify the aggregate and distributional implications of this phenomenon,
we develop a quantifiable general equilibrium model where firms can serve a market by ex30 In the Online Appendix, we formally show that the probabilistic setup in our model is isomorphic to
the one in Tintelnot (2017) and Sun (2017), where each firmÕs productivity in a location is the product of a
Pareto-distributed core productivity and a location-specific Fréchet-distributed efficiency shock, and marketentry decisions are made before observing the location-specific efficiencies.

porting from their home country, by producing in the foreign market, or by exporting from
a third location. In making their location decisions, firms face a proximity-comparative advantage tradeoff: trade costs may induce firms to open foreign affiliates near to their foreign
customers, but this proximity may imply not minimizing production costs. In the aggregate,
countries that have a high productivity in innovation relative to production tend to specialize
in innovation, but home market effects create forces to concentrate production in countries
with large “market potential” while drawing innovation towards countries with large “production potential.” The model yields simple structural expressions for bilateral trade and MP
that we use in our calibration across a set of OECD countries. We use the calibrated model
to perform a series of counterfactual exercises designed to study the welfare implications
of shocks driving increased specialization in innovation and production across countries.
We find that countries that specialize in production due to HMEs may experience aggregate
losses, although these losses tend to be very small. Contrary to popular fears, we find that
production workers gain even in countries that further specialize in innovation.

A.5

Proof of Proposition 2

It immediately follows from (13) and (14), that as κ → ∞ workers become perfect substitutes.
Hence, an interior equilibrium in which both innovation and production occur in country i
p
requires wie = wi . As such, we refer to the single wage wi for country i.
Part (i) First, as a preliminary result, we establish that if L̄1 > L̄2 , then ω ≡ w1 /w2 > 1.
E
The absence of trade costs implies that λin
≡ λiE for any i, n (For future reference, note that
E
E
this implies that λ1E + λ2E = λ11
+ λ21
= 1) and that Ψin ≡ Ψi for any i, n. The zero-profit
condition in (16) implies
L1e = ηλ1E ( L̄1 + L̄2 /ω ),
L2e /ω

=

ηλ2E ( L̄1

+ L̄2 /ω ).

(A.12)
(A.13)

Using these equations together with the definition of λiE , which implies that
λiE =

Mi Ψin
Mi Ψ i
=
,
∑k Mk Ψkn
∑ k Mk Ψ k

(A.14)

and Mi f e = Lie , we have ω = Ψ1 /Ψ2 .
Using the definition of Ψin and the assumption of A1 = A2 , we can obtain after some
derivations
θ
ω 1/(1−ρ) − γ−θ/(1−ρ)
L̄1
= ω 1− ρ
.
(A.15)
L̄2
1 − γ−θ/(1−ρ) ω 1/(1−ρ)
The right hand side of this equation is increasing in ω which implies that ω is increasing in
L̄1 / L̄2 . Since L̄1 / L̄2 = 1 implies ω = 1, then L̄1 / L̄2 > 1 implies ω > 1, which proves the
preliminary result.
Second, using the previous result we can prove that if L̄1 > L̄2 then r1 > r2 . The proof is
by contradiction. Suppose that r1 < r2 . From the labor market clearing condition in (15) and

52

T
from (17) and λin

Using the definition for λlT , the result λin

expression (A.16) implies


ρ 
L̄2 r2 ω 1−ρ γ−θ/(1−ρ) − ω θ/(1−ρ)+1 > L̄1 r1 ω θ/(1−ρ)+1 γ−θ/(1−ρ) − 1 ,

which will finally allow us to prove the result by contradiction. Note that when L̄1 > L̄2
we have ω > 1, so that the term in parentheses on the left-hand-side of this inequality is
negative. If ω θ/(1−ρ)+1 γ−θ/(1−ρ) ≥ 1, then the inequality is violated and the desired contradiction is shown. Alternately, if ω θ/(1−ρ)+1 γ−θ/(1−ρ) < 1 we can substitute out L̄2 / L̄1 from
the inequality using ( A.15) to arrive at an expression that given the assumption that θ > 1
contradicts the initial assertion that r1 < r2 . Thus, since this assertion leads to a contradiction
in all cases, we conclude that r1 > r2 , which completes the proof of part i).
p
Part (ii) Denote the size of the labor forces as L and note that with κ → ∞ wie = wi = wi .
Let ω ≡ w1 /w2 . From the free entry conditions for countries 1 and 2 and the assumption of
no trade costs, it follows that ω = Ψ1 /Ψ2 . Using the definitions, this implies

(A.17)

We first show that γ12 < γ21 implies that ω > 1. Note that for γ12 = γ21 the only solution to

Equation (A.17) then confirms that dω/dγ21 > 0. Hence for γ12 < γ21 , ω > 1.
Now, we turn to the labor market clearing, equation (15). With identical countries and
free trade, the labor market clearing condition for country 1 can be written.

The left-hand side of this inequality must be positive because γ12 < γ21 implies ω > 1.
Moreover, ω > 1 and γ12 < γ21 imply that the right-hand side of this inequality must be
negative. Hence, this is a contradiction and we conclude that r1 > η. By the equilibrium
conditions, we have r2 = η + ω (η − r1 ) which implies that r2 < η.

We start with part (i) of the proposition and begin by showing that the mass of varieties is
proportional to the population of the economy. For any given relative wage, the limit as

(expenditure) in country i under frictionless trade and no MP, and let Wi∗ (Xi∗ ) be the real
wage (expenditure) in country i under frictionless trade and MP. We first characterize the
expressions for welfare under restricted entry in the following Lemma, which we prove in
the Online Appendix.
(θ +1)(θσ−σ+1)

Lemma 2 Consider a world with no worker mobility, κ → 1, where Ai = A, and tti <

∀i, and assume ρ → 1 for all i. The ratio of the real wage under frictionless trade and MP to the real

wage under free trade and no MP, Wi ≡ Wi∗ /Wi , is given by the expression:

With the help of this lemma, we can now proceed to prove the two parts of the proposition. Notice that around ti ' t, the restriction specified in the Lemma is always satisfied, so
that we can make use of the Lemma for proving Proposition 3.
(1+ θ )2

Part (i) We first show that real wages increase iff σ < θ̄ ≡

Taking logs in (A.25), differentiating with respect to the size of one country ti , and evaluating
it at ti = t, for all i, we get that the sign of this derivative is determined by

This expression is similar to what we had above for real wages, only that instead of υ we
now have υ + θ. Thus, the condition for real income to increase with MP is that (υ + θ ) η >
θ/(1 + θ ). Notice that this condition is equivalent to θ > σ − 1, which we always require for
the various integrals to have a finite mean. Thus, real expenditure must increase with MP.
In a similar manner we can show that the innovation wage increases under frictionless
trade and MP. With frictionless trade and no MP we have Wie = Wi η/ (1 − η ), while with

57

frictionless trade and MP we have Wie∗ = Wi∗ tti η/ (1 − η ). This implies that

Now consider part (ii) of the proposition. We begin by solving for the equilibrium real
income of innovation labor in country j. In the absence of MP, there can be no specialization
in trade or MP so we relative wages are fixed at

These three equations completely pin down the real income of a unit of innovation labor in
the no MP equilibrium.
In the equilibrium with MP, the fact that there are not trade barriers and there are free flow
of ideas requires that factor price equalization prevails for innovation labor: wie = wej = we
for all i. For all i 6= j production labor can only be used for marketing fixed costs so that

1 ≥ θ2.
Note that the requirement that θ > max(1, σ − 1) implies that the term on the right-hand
side of this inequality must be greater than one. This contradicts the assertion that income
must rise. Hence, the real income of innovation workers in country j must fall.

Gains from MP with frictionless trade and homogenous workers

We now establish the claim in Section 2.5.3 that a move from frictionless trade but no MP
to frictionless trade and frictionless MP increases the common real wage paid to workers
employed in the innovation and production sector under perfect worker mobility, or homogeneous workers, κ → ∞.
To prove the result we first compute the real wage under two scenarios: (i) frictionless
trade and frictionless MP; and (ii) frictionless trade but no MP. Then we compare the two
cases. Note that when κ → ∞, wages in the innovation and production sector are equalized,
wi = wie .
(i) Frictionless trade and frictionless MP. From ( A.9) and the normalization w N = 1, we
get

wn = Tne /TN
Using (A.11), which holds in the case of frictionless trade and MP, together with (A.7), (17)
and (A.26), and replacing into the price index in (A.6), we obtain the real wage in country n
under frictionless trade and MP,

(ii) Frictionless trade but no MP. Given that there is no MP, trade is balanced so that Xn =

Data

The production data for the restricted sample (Xiln , where i = U.S.) were assembled from several sources that depend on the location of production l. For the case of l 6= U.S. (U.S. MP
abroad), our data are from the confidential 1999 survey of the BEA of U.S. direct investment
abroad. This legally mandatory survey identifies all U.S. firms that own productive facilities abroad. The survey requires firms to report for their majority-owned, manufacturing
affiliates the location of the affiliates l, the sales of these affiliates to customers in their host
country (l = n) and their sales to customers in the United States, Canada, Japan, the United
Kingdom, and an aggregation of a subset of countries in the European Union (l 6= U.S., n).31
For the case of l = U.S., the data was constructed using a mixture of publicly available
data and a confidential survey conducted by the BEA on the activities of the U.S. affiliates
of foreign firms. Aggregate bilateral trade volumes in manufactures and aggregate domestic
manufacturing sales were collected from Feenstra et al. (2002) and the Census of Manufac31 These

countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Ireland,
Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. The BEA data for affiliate exports contains information on the
destination for only these four countries and for seven regions in total. Of these regions, only the European
countries share a common tariff.

61

turing respectively. From these aggregates we subtracted the total contribution of foreign
firms to these sales using the BEA data set.
The data for the unrestricted sample (∑i Xiln ) were also constructed using data from several
sources. The bilateral trade data (l 6= n) came from Feenstra et al. (2002) for the year 1999.
The domestic production data (l = n) was collected from the OECD for most developed
countries, from the INSTAT database maintained by UNIDO for many of the developing
countries, and for a few additional countries the domestic absorption data was obtained from
the estimates found in Simonovska & Waugh (2013). In the estimation we use only those
bilateral pair observations for which both Xiln and Xln are both nonzero and non-missing,
yielding a sample of 316 observations.
The data for trade frictions was drawn from several sources. The raw tariff data was
obtained from either the WTO or from WITS maintained by the World Bank. Tariffs applied
by a given country n can differ from their MFN levels across exporting countries l either
because no tariff is applied, as when n = l or n and l are both in a free trade agreement or
customs union, or because country n extends GSP tariffs to a developing country l. Data
for distance (dln ) and for the standard gravity controls (Hln ) are from the Centre d’Etudes
Prospectives et Informations Internationales (CEPII). To allow for non-linearities in the effect of
distance on trade cost, we constructed six categorical variables (D1 through D6) defined by
the size of the distance.32 Finally, a dummy variable was included that takes a value of one
for the case in which l = n and a value of zero for the case l 6= n.

C

Calibration Procedure

The algorithm for calibration is divided in three steps explained below.
Step 1. Given a value for θ and ρ, the data on absorption, trade flows, and MP flows, we
use our model to obtain an implied set of trilateral flows Xiln . Having those trilateral flows,
we can then apply a generalized Head-Ries procedure to obtain estimates of (symmetric)
p
trade and MP costs. Define til ≡ Tl (wl τ ln )−θ and gil ≡ Mi Tie γil−θ . Using (7), combined with
(8) and the definitions of ψiln and Ψin , the set of trilateral flows Xiln can be written as:

where gross manufacturing output for country l in the data is simply calculated using data

on trade flows and absorption as Yl = ∑n λln

as well as absorption and gross manufacturing output, we can back up the set of gil and tln
from (C.2) and (C.3) and then use them to solve for Xiln in (C.1).

Xi ), in a country. The Online Appendix shows innovation shares, ri , expenditure, Xi , output,

country in our sample.
Step 3. We iterate on the value of the parameter θ such that we match the unrestricted-
