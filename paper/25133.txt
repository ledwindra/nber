ABSTRACT
Many believe that global capital markets will generate lower returns in the future versus the past.
We examine how persistently lower real returns will reshape work, retirement, saving, and
investment behavior of older persons using a calibrated dynamic life cycle model. In a low return
regime, workers build up less wealth in their tax-qualified 401(k) accounts versus the past, claim
social security benefits later, and work more. Moreover, the better-educated are more sensitive to
real interest rate changes, and the least-educated alter their behavior less. Interestingly, wealth
inequality is lower in periods of persistent low expected returns.

How Will Persistent Low Expected Returns
Shape Household Economic Behavior?
Despite the recent rise of inflation in the United States and other Western developed
countries, it appears that persistently low real interest rates are likely to characterize the global
economy for some time to come. For instance, governments in many European nations can now
borrow at negative real rates for as far out as 50 years (Lewin, 2016; Zeng, 2017). The present
paper asks how a long-term low return environment will alter household economic behaviors
including work and saving patterns, social security benefit claiming ages, and retirement
decumulation.
Our analysis is informed by previous research examining how rational decision makers
are influenced by shocks or unanticipated surprises in the environments they confront. For
instance, the influential work of Gomes and Michaelides (2005) and Cocco, Gomes, and
Maenhout (2015) was extended by Love (2010) and Hubener, Maurer, and Mitchell (2016),
who showed how marriage, divorce, and widowhood as well as the arrival of children can
influence optimal consumption, insurance, asset allocation, and retirement patterns. Love
(2007) and Gomes, Michaelides, and Polkovnichenko (2009) developed a lifecycle model
which includes tax-deferred 401(k) retirement accounts. Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell, and
Rogalla (2015) reported how capital market surprises alter saving and investment choices. Chai,
Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2011) and Gomes, Kotlikoff, and Viceira (2008) explained how
labor market adjustments and endogenous claiming of social security benefits can help workers
manage earnings and capital market risk in a life cycle setting. Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell
(2018) illustrated how the overall population would change behavior in response to low
expected returns.
In what follows, we build and calibrate a life cycle model incorporating population
heterogeneity that embeds stock market and labor market uncertainty, stochastic mortality, U.S.
tax rules and minimum distribution requirements for 401(k) plans, and real-world social

2

security benefit formulas. This calibrated lifecycle dynamic model produces realistic baseline
results that agree with observed saving, work, and claiming age patterns of U.S. households.
Next, we simulate anticipated changes in behavior given low real expected returns and compare
outcomes with the baseline results. Our particular interest is to show how persistently low
returns will alter behavior across a heterogeneous population. For instance, both men and
women worker longer and claim social security benefits about a year later, and the response is
most pronounced for the college-educated. Additionally, better-educated persons are more
sensitive to real returns than other people, so they reduce saving in their tax-qualified retirement
accounts the most. Accordingly, wealth inequality will be attenuated in a low expected return
world. We also explore how results vary given a “Japanese” style economy with low expected
returns and low equity risk premia, and we separately examine how results differ if an agebased investment glide path similar to Target Date funds were to be imposed. Our findings are
robust to these alternative formulations.

The Lifecycle Model
To illustrate how persistent low returns are likely to influence household behavior in a
life cycle setting, we build and calibrate a rational dynamic consumption and portfolio choice
model for utility-maximizing individuals over the life cycle. Using this, we simulate optimal
outcomes in a positive real return environment, which we term the “baseline” setting. Finally,
we compare those outcomes with results in a zero return world.
Preferences. Working in discrete time, we posit that the individual’s decision period starts at
𝑡𝑡 = 1 (age of 25) and ends at 𝑇𝑇 = 76 (age 100); accordingly, each period corresponds to one

year. People have uncertain lifetimes, where the probability of surviving from year 𝑡𝑡 to 𝑡𝑡 + 1

is denoted by 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 . We represent preferences in each period by the Cobb Douglas utility function
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 (𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ) =

(𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝛼𝛼 )1−𝜌𝜌
1−𝜌𝜌

which is a function of current consumption 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 and leisure time 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 (where

the latter is normalized as a fraction of total available time). The parameter 𝛼𝛼 measures leisure

3

preferences, 𝜌𝜌 denotes relative risk aversion, and 𝛽𝛽 is the individual’s time preference factor.

The value function is derived recursively as:
𝐽𝐽𝑡𝑡 =

with terminal utility 𝐽𝐽𝑇𝑇 =

𝛼𝛼
�𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇 𝑙𝑙𝑇𝑇
�

1−𝜌𝜌

1−𝜌𝜌

(𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝛼𝛼 )1−𝜌𝜌
+ 𝛽𝛽𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 𝐽𝐽𝑡𝑡+1 ) ,
1 − 𝜌𝜌

(1)

and 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 = 1 after retirement. Survival rates 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 in the value

function are taken from US Population Life Tables (Arias 2010). As discussed later, we
calibrate the preference parameters in such a way that our results match empirical claiming rates
reported by the U.S. Social Security Administration (2015) as well as actual wealth profiles
invested in retirement plans.

Labor Income, Work Patterns, and Social Security Retirement Benefits. Our model quite
realistically allows individuals to select flexible work effort patterns and a retirement age:
specifically, a worker can allocate up to (1 − 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ) = 0.6 of his available time budget to paid work
(assuming 100 waking hours per week and 52 weeks per year). Depending on his work effort,
his uncertain yearly pre-tax labor income is:
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ) · 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 · 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡+1 · 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡+1 .

(2)

Here 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 is a deterministic wage rate component that depends on age, education, and sex, and
whether the individual works overtime, full-time, or part-time. The variable 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 · 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡+1

represents the permanent component of the wage rate with independent log-normally
distributed shocks 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 ~𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(−0.5σ2P , σ2𝑃𝑃 ) having a mean of one and volatility of σ2𝑃𝑃 . In addition,

𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 ~𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(−0.5σ2U , σ2𝑈𝑈 ) is a transitory shock assumed to be uncorrelated with 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 and with
volatility σ2𝑈𝑈 . This wage rate calibration follows Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2016) who

estimated the deterministic component of the wage rate process 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 and the variances of the

permanent and transitory wage shocks 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 and 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 using the 1975–2013 waves of the PSID. 1

These are estimated separately by sex and educational level, where the latter is identified as less
than High School, High School graduate, or at least some college (<HS, HS, Coll+). 2
In the U.S., a worker may decide to quit working and claim social security benefits
between the ages of 62 and 70, where the benefit paid depends on his average lifetime 35 best
years of earnings. If the individual claims benefits prior to (after) the system-defined Normal
Retirement Age, his lifelong social security benefits are reduced (increased) according to a prespecified set of factors. If he works beyond age 62, the model requires that he devote at least
one hour per week; also, overtime work is excluded (i.e., 0.01 ≤ (1 − 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ) ≤ 0.4).

Constraints During the Work Life. During his work life, an individual may use his cash on
hand for consumption or for investments. Some portion 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 of the worker’s pre-tax salary 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡

can be invested in a tax-qualified 401(k)-retirement plan (up to a limit of $18,000, and from
age 50 onwards, an additional $6,000 catch up contributions is allowed). 3 Specifically, the plan
is of the of the deferred taxation type such that contributions to the account and investment
earnings are tax-exempt, while withdrawals are taxed. In addition, the worker may invest
outside his retirement plan in risky stocks 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 and riskless bonds 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 . As such, his cash on hand
𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 in each year is given by:

𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 = 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 + 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 + 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 ,

(3)

where the usual constraints apply (i.e., 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 , 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 , 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 , 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 ≥ 0). One year later, his cash on hand is
given by the value of stocks (bonds) having earned an uncertain (riskless) gross return of 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1

(𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 ), plus income from work (after housing expenses ℎ𝑡𝑡 ), plus withdrawals (𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 ) from the
401(k) plan, minus any federal/state/city taxes and social security contributions (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡+1):
𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1 + 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 + 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 (1 − ℎ𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 − 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡+1 .

(4)

Details are given in Horneff, Maurer and Mitchell (2016); see Table A1, Appendix A.
This approach to retirement benefit taxation is therefore similar to how conventional defined benefit and defined
contribution plan payments are handled under U.S. tax law as per regulations from 2015 onward.

3

5

During his work life, the individual pays taxes (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡+1) which reduce his cash on hand

available for consumption and investments Our model builds these in using a realistic payroll

tax rate of 11.65% (1.45% for Medicare, 4% city and state taxes, and 6.2% for social security
taxes). Additionally, under the US tax system, individuals must also pay progressive taxes on
labor income and on withdrawals from tax-qualified retirement plans (including a 10% penalty
tax for withdrawals before age 60), and on returns on stocks and bonds held outside taxqualified retirement accounts. 4 If an individual’s cash on hand falls below 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡+1 ≤ $5,879 p.a.

(an amount also exempt from income taxes), we posit that he will receive subsistence support
from the government at a minimum level of $5,879 for the next year.

Prior to the endogenous retirement age 𝑡𝑡 = 𝐾𝐾, assets in the worker’s tax-qualified

retirement plan are invested in bonds earning a risk-free gross (pre-tax) return of 𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 , and risky
stocks paying an uncertain gross return of 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 . Each year, the individual decides on the relative
401(𝑘𝑘)

exposure of his retirement assets in stocks 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 and (1 − 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ) in bonds. The total value (𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡+1

)

of his 401(k) assets at time 𝑡𝑡 + 1 is determined by the previous period’s value minus
401(𝑘𝑘)

withdrawals (𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 ≤ 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡

), plus additional employee contributions (𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 ), plus matching

contributions (if any) from the employer (𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 ) , and nontaxed returns from stocks and bonds:
401(𝑘𝑘)

𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡+1

401(𝑘𝑘)

= 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 �𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡

+ (1 −

− Wt + 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 + 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 �R t+1

𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 )�𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡

(5)

− Wt + 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 + 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 �𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 , 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑡𝑡 < 𝐾𝐾.

Subject to complex matching limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, employer matches
are often feasible in the retirement accounts. Here we assume that the employer matches 100%
of employee contributions up to 5% of the employee’s yearly salary (but, as per US law, not

4

For details, see Horneff, Maurer and Mitchell (2016).

6

exceeding $265,000 or $ 13,250 per year). 5 Accordingly, the employer matching contribution
is given by:
𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 = min�𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 , min(0.05𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 , 13,250)�.

(6)

Wealth Dynamics after Claiming. As per U.S. social security rules, the worker may claim
social security benefits between age 62 and 70. The social security benefit formula uses the 35
best years of income converted into an annual Primary Insurance Amount (or the unreduced
social security benefit) using a redistributive formula. 6 Also by law, a retiree’s Required
Minimum Distribution (RMD) amounts from his tax-qualified 401(k) account are set in
accordance with the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table measures (IRS 2012a, b). Federal income
taxes are calculated based on the individual’s taxable income, the six (progressive) income tax
brackets and the corresponding marginal tax rates for each tax bracket (Horneff et al. 2015).
After retirement at the endogenous age 𝐾𝐾, the individual has the opportunity to save

outside the tax-qualified retirement plan in stocks and bonds:
𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 = 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 + 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 .

(7)

We model housing costs ℎ𝑡𝑡 as in Love (2010). Accordingly, cash on hand for the next period
evolves as follows:

𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1 + 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 + 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 (1 − ℎ𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 − 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡+1 .

(8)

Social security old age retirement benefits are determined by the individual’s Primary Insurance
Amount (PIA), which is determined by his 35 best years of earnings and his claiming age. 7
Social security payments (𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 ) in retirement (𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝐾𝐾) are given by:
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐾𝐾 ⋅ 𝜆𝜆𝐾𝐾 ⋅ 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡+1 .

5

(9)

Love (2007) reported that US pension contribution matching rates range between 1% and 10% with a modal
value of 6%.
6
For more on the Social Security formula see https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/piaformula.html.
7
The benefit formula is a piece-wise linear function of the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings providing (as of
2013) a replacement rate of 90% up to a first bend point ($791), 32% between the first and the second bend point
$4768), and 15% above that. See US SSA (nd).

7

Here 𝜆𝜆𝐾𝐾 is the adjustment factor for claiming prior to or after the government-set Normal

Retirement Age, which in this exercise is set at age 66. 8 The variable 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 is a transitory shock

𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 ~LN(−0.5𝜎𝜎ℇ2 , 𝜎𝜎ℇ2 ) reflecting out-of-pocket medical and other expenditure shocks during

retirement (as in Love 2010). Benefit payments from social security are partially subject to tax

at the individual’s federal income tax rate, as well as a 1.45% Medicare and 4% city and state
tax. 9
We model the retiree’s 401(k) plan payouts as follows:
401(𝑘𝑘)

𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡+1

401(𝑘𝑘)

= 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 �𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡

+ (1

− Wt �R t+1

401(𝑘𝑘)
− 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 )�𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡

(10)
− Wt �𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 ,

𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑡𝑡 < 𝐾𝐾.

Under US law, plan participants must take retirement account payouts from age 70 onwards
according to the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) rules (m) specified by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS 2012b). Accordingly, to avoid substantial penalty taxes withdrawals
from the retirement account, the retiree must take into account the following constraint:
401(𝑘𝑘)

𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡

401(𝑘𝑘)

𝑚𝑚 ≤ 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 < 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡

. All of these rich institutional factors are taken into account in

generating our model outcomes.

Optimal Behavior Under the Baseline
We first simulate our model under what had been considered to be “normal” interest
rate conditions, to illustrate baseline optimal patterns of consumption, saving, work, social
security claiming, portfolio allocations outside inside and outside the tax-qualified accounts,
and withdrawals from the tax-qualified 401(k) plans. This baseline calibration assumes a risk-

8

The factors we use are 0.75 (claiming age 62), 0.8 (claiming age 63), 0.867 (claiming age 64), 0.933 (claiming
age 65), 1.00 (claiming age 66), 1.08 (claiming age 67), 1.16 (claiming age 68), 1.24 (claiming age 69), and 1.32
(claiming age 70). See US SSA (nd,). The Normal Retirement Age will move to age 67 in the near future.
9
For tax rules for Social Security, see US SSA (nd). Based on the combined income up to 85% of Social Security
can be taxed for households with high income additional to Social Security benefits. Yet because of quite generous
exemptions, many households receive their Social Security benefits tax-free (see Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell
2016).

8

free interest rate of 1%, and an expected risk premium on stocks (over the risk-free rate) of 5%
with a volatility of 18%. When simulating other return environments, we vary these
assumptions and then assess how behavioral outcomes compare.
We posit that households maximize the value function (1) under the budget restrictions
given above. Since this optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, we apply a
numerical procedure using dynamic stochastic programming. To generate optimal policy
functions,

30(X)×20(𝐹𝐹 401(𝑘𝑘) )×10(P)×9(K), with 𝑋𝑋 being cash on hand, 𝐹𝐹 401(𝑘𝑘) assets held in the 401(k)
retirement plan, 𝑃𝑃 permanent income, and K the claiming age. Next, we simulate 100,000
independent life cycles based on optimal feedback controls for each of the six population
subgroups of interest (male/female in three education groups of <HS/HS/Coll+). Using weights
from the National Center on Education Statistics (2012) we aggregate the subgroups to obtain
national mean values. The population is comprised of 50.7% females (of whom 62% have
Coll+, 30% have HS, and 8% have <HS education), and 49.3% males (of whom 60% have
Coll+, 30% have HS, and 10% <HS education).
Baseline Results. For each of the six subgroups of interest, we select a unique set of values of
the preference parameters so the model produces national 401(k) wealth profiles and social
security claiming patterns compatible with historical evidence. After solving the model several
times, we find that a coefficient of relative risk aversion ρ of 5, a time discount rate β of 0.96
and a leisure preference parameter of 𝛼𝛼 = 0.9 are the parameters that closely match simulated

model outcomes to empirical evidence. 10

This is evident from Panel A of Figure 1 which indicates that the social security claiming
patterns generated by our baseline model align well with empirical claiming rates reported by

10

Interestingly, these parameters are also in line with those used in prior work on life-cycle portfolio choice; see,
for instance, Brown (2001).

9

the US Social Security Administration (2015). 11 In particular, the model produces a substantial
peak at the earliest claiming age of 62, mirroring the data where around 45% of workers claim
benefits at that early age. Also in line with the evidence, a smaller second peak can be seen at
the (system-defined) Full Retirement Age of 66, where about 15% of workers claim benefits
for the first time.
Figure 1 here
In addition, our model closely tracks EBRI (2017) data on average 401(k) account
balances (in year 2015) for 7.5 million plan participants in five age groups (20-29, 30-39, 4049, 50-59, and 60-69). Panel B of Figure 1 compares our simulated and the empirical data for
the five age groups, and it reveals that our simulated outcomes are remarkably close to the
empirically-observed 401(k) account values.
Overall, then, our model generates results that agree closely with observed saving and
social security claiming behavior of U.S. households during what we call the “baseline”
economic environment, before the advent of persistent low expected returns.

How Persistent Low Returns Will Drive Behavioral Change
To determine how optimal economic behavior would differ in alternative interest rate
environments, we compare outcomes for real risk-free interest rates of 0% and 2%, with a
particular focus on the lowest and the highest expected return: in this case, the equity risk
premium remains at 5% as in the baseline scenario. In addition, we analyze a situation a real
risk-free 0% interest rate and an equity risk premium of only 2%. The latter scenario is
comparable to the capital market situation characterizing Japan over the past 30 years. Table 1
shows how social security claiming patterns would respond by gender and age, average
claiming ages, and average hours of work.

11
This model therefore provides a theoretical backing for the empirical claiming patterns shown by Shoven and
Slavov (2012, 2014).

10

Table 1 here
A first finding is that optimal social security claiming ages and hours of work increase
when the risk-free rate is lower. This is not surprising, inasmuch as individuals earn less on
their savings in a 0% environment and hence would need to withdraw more of their assets if
they claimed early. Specifically, when the long term interest rate is 0% instead of 2%, average
claiming ages rise by about one year later and average work hours are five percent higher, for
both men and women. Moreover, substantially fewer women and men claim at age 62 in the
low-return world: only 35.5% (24.2) of the females (males) do so when the real return is 0%,
versus 46.1% (37.2%) at a 2% real return. This supports Shoven and Slavov’s (2012) and Cahill,
Giandrea, and Quinn’s (2015) surmise that delayed claiming is more appealing in a low versus
a high return environment. In the capital market scenario with a real interest rate of 0% and an
equity premium of only 2%, behavior changes even more in the same direction. Men and
women claim 1.5 years later on average, compared to the high return case. In addition, during
the work life, individuals devote per week more than 3 hours more on the job, compared to the
high return case.
Figure 2 provides additional insight into the heterogeneous impact of low versus high
returns. Specifically, the most-educated defer claiming more when returns are 0% versus 2%;
a similar conclusion applies to both men and women. By contrast, the least-educated
(particularly women) change claiming behavior very little.
Figure 2 here
Next, we report how optimal wealth accumulation patterns vary with the interest rate
regime, both inside and outside 401(k) plans. Table 2 shows that workers build up far less
wealth in their retirement plans in a low versus a higher expected return environment. For
instance, if the safe yield is only 0%, middle-aged women (age 45-54) optimally accumulate an
average of about $145,000 in their 401(k) plans. By contrast, in the 2% yield scenario, they
average 20% more, or $168,400 at the same point in their life cycle. Middle-aged men

11

accumulate $176,100 in the zero-rate environment, and 20% more ($206,700) in the 2% interest
rate scenario. In other words, the gain from saving in pretax plans is lower in a low return
environment, depressing the tax advantage of saving in 401(k) plans. The Table also shows that
the impact of a lower interest rate on assets in non-qualified accounts is relatively small. The
reason is that such accounts tend to be held for precautionary reasons, to smooth consumption
in case of income shocks or capital market shocks.
Table 2 here
In the worst-case “Japanese” capital market scenario, middle-aged (age 45-54) men as
well as women accumulate 40% less in their tax-qualified retirement accounts compared to the
more favorable baseline situation where the interest rate was 2% and the equity risk premium
5%. The “Japanese” economic environment has a larger percentage impact boosting assets held
outside retirement accounts, by 53% for middle-aged women and 39% for similar-aged men.
Nevertheless, these nonpension accounts remain small compared to the 401(k) asset holdings.
Figure 3 shows how 401(k) asset values diverge by gender and education under the lowversus the high-expected return scenarios. When returns are low, the optimal value of taxqualified retirement savings proves to be substantially smaller for both men and women, and
for all three age and education groups. Additionally, saving reductions are most notable for the
best-educated individuals. Conversely, in a higher return world, the college-educated save 3040% more, with 15% less for high-school dropouts. Accordingly, wealth inequality is
diminished in times of low real expected returns.
Figure 3 here
Thus far, our analysis has assumed that households optimize their asset allocation inside
their 401(k) plans (i.e. the portfolio weights in stocks and bonds are endogenous). Yet a large
majority of 401(k) retirement plans today automatically default workers’ contributions into
target-date investment strategies that follow an age-based allocation rule, entailing higher
equity shares early in life and lower ones nearing and into retirement (Vanguard 2017).

12

Moreover, the regulatory environment has encouraged this practice, in that the 2006 Pension
Protection Act permitted plan sponsors to include Target Date Funds (TDFs) as qualified
default investment alternatives in participant-directed plans. Accordingly, we investigate how
sensitive our results are to a default 401(k) allocation that follows an age-related portfolio rule;
while there are many variants in the market, generally speaking the percentage of 401(k) assets
invested in equities follows a (120 – age)/100 rule. This we implement in Table 3. 12
Table 3 here
To illustrate the key differences in outcomes when the real interest rates drops from 2%
to 0%, we report average differences in social security claiming ages (in years) and average
percentage differences in 401(k) assets for the two investment strategies. Both females and
males claim slightly later if the 401(k) plan were to be invested according to a Target Date (agebased) rule versus optimal endogenous equity weights. This is accompanied by a larger drop in
401(k) assets for the Target Date portfolio, compared to the endogenous asset allocation case.
This is due to the fact that the worker’s exposure to bonds is higher under the Target Date
approach versus the optimal asset allocation, particularly for older workers and for retirees.
Nevertheless, as these differences are small in magnitude, we conclude the two investment
approaches do not materially change economic behaviors in the context of persistently low
interest rates.

Conclusions
Over $8 trillion of bonds currently trade at negative rates around the world, compared
to none in 2014 (Slok, 2018). Despite this new global reality, relatively little research has
focused on the profound impacts of persistent low returns on life cycle work, saving,
investment, and social security claiming behavior.

Our contribution in this paper is therefore to develop and calibrate a richly-detailed life
cycle model that enables us to explore the potential impacts of this new economic environment
across heterogeneous population subgroups. To this end, we model realistic tax, social security,
and minimum distribution rules, as well as uncertain income, stock returns, medical spending,
and mortality. We then use this model to assess how key outcomes change. The baseline
simulation which assumes a 1% expected real return generates wealth and claiming patterns
quite consistent with the evidence, including a peak claiming rate at the earliest feasible age of
62, and asset accumulation patterns comparable to actual data.
By contrast, a zero expected return induces workers to claim social security benefits
later and increase work effort. Moreover, people save less, particularly in their tax-qualified
accounts, and they draw down their 401(k) assets sooner. Results prove to be similar for men
and women, yet the best-educated subgroup optimally changes behavior more, compared to the
least-educated. Overall, the changes reduce observed wealth inequality. Sensitivity analyses
allowing for age-based investment profiles akin to Target Date funds shows that results are
robust. We also compare our results to those generated by a “Japanese” style economy with low
expected returns and low equity premia, and again findings are comparable.
We leave for future work a discussion of the potential macroeconomic consequences of
reduced saving and earlier claiming patterns. Nevertheless, our life cycle model which
embodies richly detailed tax and social security claiming rules is clearly an invaluable tool to
help assess how households will react to the “new normal” financial market conditions.

Notes: Panel A compares endogenous social security claiming rates at ages 62-70 generated by our life cycle model versus
retirement (and disability) empirical claiming rates by age from Social Security Administration (2015). Expected values
are calculated from 100,000 simulated lifecycles based on optimal feedback controls for each of the six subgroups of
interest. Results for the female (male) population use income by education levels for men (62% +Coll; 30% HS; 8% <HS)
and women (60% +Coll; 30% HS; 10%<HS). Baseline calibration parameters are: risk aversion 𝜌𝜌 = 5; time preference
𝛽𝛽 = 0.96; and leisure preference α=0.9. Social security benefits are based on average permanent incomes and the 2013
value of bendpoints; minimum required withdrawals from 401(k) plans are based on life expectancy using the IRS-Uniform
Lifetime Table in 2013; tax rules for 401(k) plans are as in Horneff (2015). The risk premium for stock returns is 5% and
return volatility 18%; the risk-free rate in the Baseline is 1%. Panel B compares simulated 401(k) account balances by age
(averages for ages 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69) with empirical data from EBRI (2017). Source: Authors’
calculations.

Notes: This Table reports the average difference in 401(k) assets and average difference in Social Security
claiming ages over the lifecycle for an interest rate level of 0% instead of 2% used in the base case. For the row
labeled life Target Date, the equity weights of 401(k) assets are determined according to an age-based (120age)/100 rule. For the row labeled Endogenous, the equity weights in 401(k) assets are derived from optimal
feedback controls in the life cycle model. The assumed risk premium for stock returns is 5% and return volatility
18%. Other parameters are as in Figure 1. Source: Authors’ calculations.
