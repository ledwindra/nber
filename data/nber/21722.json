    "abstract": "\n\nUS monetary policy shocks induce comovements in the international financial variables that characterize the \u201cGlobal Financial Cycle.\u201d One global factor explaining an important share of the variation of risky asset prices around the world decreases significantly after a US monetary contraction. Monetary tightening in the US leads to significant deleveraging of global financial intermediaries, a decline in the provision of domestic credit globally, strong retrenchments of international credit flows, and tightening of foreign financial conditions. Countries with floating exchange rate regimes are subject to similar financial spillovers.\n\n",
