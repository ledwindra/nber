Discontinuous Distributions and Missing Persons:
The Minimum Wage and Unemployed Youth
ABSTRACT

The effects of minimum wage legislation on the employment and wage rates

of youth are estimated using a new statistical approach. We find that without the minimum, not only would the percent of out-of-school youth who are
employed be 4 to 6 percent higher than it is, but also that these youth would
earn more.

In particular, the expected hourly earnings of youth with market

wage rates below the 1978 minimum are 10 percent lower with the minimum than

they would be without it. Thus, an effect of the minimum is to increase the
concentration of non-employment among low-wage workers and to reduce their

earnings relative to higher wage workers as well. The minimum wage accounts
for possibly a third of the difference between the employment rates of black
and white youth, according to our results.

Our methodology is based on parameterization of the effect of the minimum
on the distribution of "market" employment outcomes and market wage rates that

would exist in the absence of the minimum. A concomitant of the estimation
procedure is joint estimation of market wage and employment functions that
would pertain if there were no minimum.

DISCONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS AND MISSING PERSONS:
THE MINIMUM WAGE AND UNEMPLOYED YOUTH

by

Robert H. Meyer and David A. Wise*

Most econometric analysis rests on the assumption that random

variables have continuous distributions. But government programs and
legislation often impose constraints on individual choice so that empiri-

cally observed distributions are discontinuous. The minimum wage has
such an effect on the distribution of observed wage rates. Most arialyss
of the effect of the minimum, however, is based on inferences from aggre-

gate data and disregards these effects. Our analysis not only accounts
explicitly for the effects of the minimum on observed distributions of
employment and wage rates, but makes these effects an integral part of
the process by which the employment and wage impacts of the minimum are
estimated.

We have proposed a procedure that estimates the employment and wage
effects of the minimum by explicitly parameterizing the relationship between the level of the minimum wage relative to the "market" wage rates

that individuals would receive in the absence of the minimum. Indeed our
approach parameterizes both observed wage and observed employment outcomes
in terms of underlying "market" wage and "market" employment relationships.

The procedure thus estimates market wage and employment functions for
youth, neither of which may be estimated directly from observed data because whether particular data are observed empirically is determined in

part by the minimum itself. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximum
likelihood.

A concomitant of our procedure is estimation of a market wage function that allows us to compare average market wage rates with the wage
rates of persons employed in the presence of a minimum wage, and to compare market wage rates with the expected wage in the presence of the mini-

mum of all youth who would have been employed in its absence. The truncation and concentration effects of the minimum on the observed distribution of wages are explicitly incorporated in our statistical model.

In

addition, we are able because of the estimation of market wage and
employment functions, to compare the distribution of employment versus
non-employment by market wage rate when there is no minimum with the
distribution when a minimum exists.

To evaluate the results of the minimum wage it is necessary to take

account of its effect on employment and its effect on wage rates. Our
procedure

of our

provides estimates of both of these effects as a direct product

estimation

procedure.

The effect of the minimum is commonly presumed to be greater the higher it is relative to the distribution of wages that would be paid in

absence of a minimum. Indeed most time series and cross-section analysis
of the effects of the minimum are based on relationships between employment and the ratio of the mtnimum wage to an average or median wage, often

—3-

an average adult wage but sometimes the average wage paid to employed

youth. Previous studies have been based on aggregate time series data
(e.g., Gramlich [1976], Mincer [1976], and Hamermesh [1980]) or aggregate

cross-section data (e.g., Welch and Cunningham [1978], Ehrenberg and
Marcus [1979], and Cunningham [1980]).

Our analysis differs from these approaches in at least two respects.

First, itis based on individual wage and employment data--collected in
the May 1978 Current Population Survey. Second, the estimation technique
emphasizes explicitly the relationship between the level of the minimum

wage relative to the distribution of market" wage rates that individuals

would receive in the absence of a minimum. Some persons who in the absence
of the minimum would be paid a wage below it are presumed to receive the

legal minimum, while others are presumed to go without work. Still others
because of non-coverage or non-compliance may continue to be paid below the

minimum. Our goal is to estimate the effect of the minimum wage by explicitly paranieterizing and estimating the likelihood that each of these
outcomes occurs.

We find that persons who have market wage rates below the minimum,
in the presence of the minimum, are paid the minimum with probability

approximately .5 and lose their jobs with probability .25. Simulations
based on our estimates indicate that employment of out-of-school young

men would be 4 to 6 percent higher if the minimum were eliminated. On
average, the expected wage of youth is lower with the minimum than with-

out it. In particular, the expected wage of youth whose market wage rates
are below the minimum is approximately 10 percent lower with than without

the minimum. In addition, the concentration of non-employment among low-

-4-

wage workers is much more pronounced with the minimum than without it.
More succinctly, those who are paid the least without the minimum, are
hurt the most by it.

Our model allows estimation of the primary effects of the minimum

wage as described by most researchers. In particular, we have presumed
that the effect is concentrated on persons who would otherwise be paid

below the minimum. The model as set forth in this paper does not allow,
for example, for an upward shift in the whole wage distribution because

of the minimum. Although we do not believe this to be a first-order
effect of the minimum, it is likely to occur to some extent. Under rather
plausible assumptions, however, our primary results would not be affected

by such shifts. Nonetheless, we will in future research address this
possibility directly.

Graphs of wage distributions that serve to motivate our analysis are

presented in section I. Our procedure rests on joint estimation of market wage and employment equations. If the disturbance terms in these
two equations are uncorrelated, however, the basic parameters of the model
may be estimated from a likelihood function based on the conditional dis-

tribution of observed wage rates only.1 For expository purposes, we shall
first present in section II this simple model and parameter estimates based
on it, without explicitly deriving it as a special case of the two-equa-

tion model. This allows the reader to understand the approach in a
relatively uncomplicated context that is directly motivated by the graphs

1. As it

turns out, this single-equation conditional wage distribution

model is similar to the specification used by Hausman and Wise [1981] to
correct for endogenous sampling with a continuous outcome variable.

—5—

in Section I.

Then the more complete model based on joint estimation of a market
wage function together with a market employment function is presented in

section III, together with empirical results based on it. This estimation
procedure uses all available information on employment status and wage
rates and is not restricted to observations with observed wage rates,

unlike the simple model. And in this section, the single equation model
is derived as a special case of the more general model. For expository
purposes, some of the shortcomings of the simple model are explained for

the first time in this section. Indeed for this reason some readers

may wish to read the first part of this section before section II. The
basic results of the empirical analysis are presented in section IV in the

form of simulations. Concluding remarks and discussions are included in
section V.

—6-

I.

Empirical Wage Distributions

To motivate our analysis, we have graphed the empirically observed
wage distributions for selected groups of youth.

The graphs are in the form of histograms with breaks at 25 cent inter-

vals. For convenience, one break is at the 1978 minimum wage of $2.65.
For most groups, there is a substantial discontinuity in the distribution

at this point and it can be easily identified. To facilitate comparison
among groups, the histogram includes in the wage interval .9O to 1.15 all
persons with wage rates below 1.15 and in the interval 5.90 to 6.15 all

persons with wage rates above 5.90. Thus apparent concentration in these
intervals must be interpreted accordingly. If the entire distribution
were graphed, the graph would approach zero gradually at both tails.
One of the presumptions underlying our analytic approach is that
the minimum wage should have a greater impact in low-wage than in high—

wage areas. This idea seems intuitively confirmed by comparison of Figures
1 and 2 in the text. The first shows the distribution for non-students 16
to 24 in the states with the lowest quintile of average adult wage rates;
the second shows the distribution in states where the average adult wage

rate is in the highest quintile. The distributions in both areas show a
substantial discontinuity at the minimum, but it is clear that the impact
of the minimum on the observed distribution of wage rates is much greater
in the low wage areas.

We also presume that the minimum wage should impinge more on youth
whose personal attributes are associated with lower earnings than on

youth whose personal attributes are associated with higher earnings. For

—7-

example, older youth with more schooling we assume would be most likely to

have wage rates (possibly marginal products) above the minimum wage and

thus not be affected substantially by it. This proposition is consistent
with the distribution presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3 shows the wage

distribution for non-student youth 20 to 24 in high—wage areas with 14

years or more schooling. The effect of the minimum is barely apparent
in this distribution.

Comparison of the distributions in Figures 4 and 5 for youth 16 to
17 versus 20 to 24 respectively provides further evidence that is also

consistent with plausible intuition. Our intuition suggests that persons
with attributes associated with low wages should be most affected by the

minimum. The graphs strongly support this expectation.
Although these distributions help to motivate our subsequent analysis
and in general are consistent with intuition, it is not clear from the
graphs what the employment effect of the minimum is.

It seems clear that

one result is a concentration of wage rates at the minimum, but whether
the apparent increase to the minimum of the wage rates of some youth is
offset by non-employment of others cannot be inferred from the graphs;
thus the motivation for our estimation technique.

There is also another consideration that may be obscured in the graphs,

but to which our analysis is directed. For example, the distributions
for whites 16 to 24 and for blacks 16 to 24 (neither of which is shown)

appear quite similar. But the distributions pertain to employed youth in
both groups. Differences between the attributes of employed black and
white youth may not be as great as between the attributes of all youth in

the distributions of wage rates without the minimum would look like those

allows us to predict such differences.

A Simple Approach

Although we shall ultimately obtain estimates based on the joint
distribution of observed wage rates and employment status of youth, for
expository purposes we shall begin with a model that is based on observed

wage rates only. This allows a development that may be intuitively
motivated by the empirical wage distributions shown in section I. And it
allows us to set forth in a simple context the rationale behind our

approach. Then we shall detail a model that treats employment and wage
outcomes jointly, a special case of which is the model set forth here.

A. The Model
Consider a group of youth characterized by a vector of measured

attributes X. The elements of X include individual measures such as
education and age, and also area specific indicators of labor market

conditions. Suppose that in the absence of a minimum wage, the distribution in the population of wages paid to employed persons with attributes
X would be described by the density function f(X); we shall refer to it as

the 'underlying" or market distribution of wages. Graphically, think of
it as the solid line in Figure 6.

Now suppose that the minimum wage is set at level M. Some persons
will continue to be paid a wage below the minimum because they work in
non-covered sectors of the economy or on jobs that are not subject to

the minimum. And indeed there may be some shifting of employment from
covered to non-covered sectors and jobs. Others may be paid below the

minimum because of non-compliance. For whatever reason, the net result
is that some persons with an underlying wage below the minimum will

continue to be hired at a wage below M. To allow for this possibility,
we suppose that there is a probability P1 that persons with an under-

lying wage below M will receive a wage below this level. (We have not
allowed P1 to depend on the precise value of the underlying wage.)
We also suppose that some persons with an underlying wage below the

minimum would after its introduction be paid at the minimum.' Although
a simple application of marginal productivity theory would imply that
persons with an underlying wage below M, would not receive M, there are

several possible explanations for such a possibility. One is that employers
may pay the minimum to persons they would otherwise pay less than the mini-

mum, but hire fewer or hire them for fewer hours. Whereas without the
minimum, a young person may be hired on a permanent basis for eight hours
each Saturday, if the youth must be paid the minimum, he may be hired for

fewer hours to do only those tasks at which he is most productive. Employers
may, for example be less prepared to pay for "slack time."2

1. Welch and Cunningham (1978) impose an extreme form of this
assumption, that is, that all persons with market wage rates below
the minimum are paid the minimum when it is in effect.
2. Hall (1979) develops this point within a framework based
on the theory of employment contracts.

—16—

Another possibility is that since the minimum wage applies only to
compensation paid directly to an employee, employers can vary the level of
non-wage compensation (e.g., on-the-job training or fringe benefits) to

offset changes in direct compensation. Individuals with market wages below
the minimum may be raised to the minimum in exchange for a comparable

reduction in on-the-job training expenditures and fringe benefits. Individuals with market wages above the minimum will be unaffected.1

Another explanation is that employers hire at the minimum persons
who would otherwise be hired at wage rates below the minimum, but offset
this overpayment with slower wage increases--say, with age for example-than would be observed without the minimum.2
In addition, employers may find it difficult to identify differences
in the quality of young workers, particularly in view of the high turnover
in youth employment and the absence of an extensive employment history.
If only because of this lack of precision, employers to comply with the
legislation may raise to the minimum the wage rates of some employees who

would otherwise receive an underlying wage below M. Whatever the reason
we suppose that with probability P2, a person with an underlying wage
below the minimum will be employed and paid the minimum.

Those with an underlying market wage below the minimum who are not
hired at a wage below M or who are not hired at M are assumed to be without

work after the introduction of the minimum. The probability that these

1. See Mincer and Leighton [1980] for an analysis of the effects
of the minimum wage on investment in on-the-job training. Wessels [1980]
examines the theoretical aspect of the minimum wage in a model that
includes fringe benefits.
2. Lazear [1980] has investigated this possibility, but did not
find much empirical support for it.

—17-

persons would be without work because of the minimum is 1 —

P1

P2.

We assume that the minimum wage does not affect the wages received by

youth whose underlying wage is above the minimum. Although it is sometimes argued that the minimum wage tends to shift upward the whole

distribution of wage rates, we believe that our model captures the primary
postulated effects of the minimum.1

These ideas can be described more formally as follows. Suppose that
the expected underlying wage of individuals with measured personal and

regional attributes X is given by X and that the variance of wage rates
among persons with characteristics X is a2. This gives rise to a wage

distribution f(W) like that shown in Figure 6. That is,
W =

(1)

X

+

where c is a disturbance term with variance a2
With a minimum wage M, wage rates may be distributed as represented

graphically by the dotted function in Figure 6. The form of this
function depends on the values of P1 and P2. For example, if P2 were
zero, there would be no pile-up of wages at M, only a jump in the density

function at M. If both P1 and P2 were zero, the density function would
be truncated at M.

In addition, we have not allowed P1 or P2 to depend--for persons
1.
with market wage rates below M--on the difference between the market wage
and the minimum, although in principle we think that they would. We
believe, however, that our estimates of P1 and P2 are good estimates of
the average values that would be obtained if som@what more realistic
assumptions were incorporated in our statistical analysis. Indeed, this
conclusion is supported by estimates obtained by dividing the market
distribution below the minimum into two intervals and estimating P1 and
values for each interval.

-18-

Let the likelihood of observed wage rates be given by h(w). It may
be written as

This formulation--although we shall

show below its derivation from a model treating wage rates and employment
jointly--may be arrived at by assuming that a random sample is drawn from

the underlying distribution of market wage rates. Then, of the values
below M, some are set to M (with probability P2), while others are discarded
(with probability (1 —

P1

P2)).

Then h(w) is the distribution of ob-

served wage rates in terms of the underlying distribution f. The denominator D may be thought of as a normalizing factor assuring that the density

function integrates to 1. One can also think of h(w) as the conditional

distribution of wages, given that a wage is observed.1 The other elements
of the function may be explained in the following way. A value of W <

M

will be observed with likelihood P1 times the likelihood of an underlying
wage W = w.

The likelihood of an observed wage at the minimum (1 cent

It is the probability that an individual who would have an ob1.

the introduction of the minimum. Or it is the probability that a person

interval) is equal to the likelihood of an underlying wage at the minimum,

plus the probability that the underlying wage is below the minimum but is

raised to the minimum. Observed wage rates above the minimum follow the
distribution of the underlying wage, except that a larger proportion of
observed than of underlying wages may be above the minimum, as indicated
by the denominator D.

For convenience, we shall consider the minimum wage to be an interval (it may be arbitrarily small, say 1 cent), going from M1 to M2. We
shall also assume that W, or a transformation of W(e.g., in W) is dis-

tributed normally. Then if

is taken to be a standardized normal distri-

bution function, h(w) is given by

We have used this

specification because it allows us conveniently to test the sensitivity

Following standard practice, the log of wages is used as the
dependent variable in our wage model. Since our results are likely to
be sensitive to this distributional assumption, we have also experimented
with other transformations of wages, in particular the Box-Cox transformation:

1. Comparison with Least Squares Results
Estimates of the parameters in equation (3) for a sample of all out-

of-school young men and women aged 16 to 24 are shown in Table 1. To serve
as an informal check for general consistency of our results with the assumptions motivating our model, we have also compared our wage function parameter

estimates with least squares estimates. We shall not emphasize the empirical
significance of the estimates in this section; they are treated as illustra-

tive. Following the discussion of these results, we will compare estimates
based on our model for selected subgroups of youth.

Simulated effects of

the minimum on the employment of these subgroups are presented in section IV.
Recall that a concomitant of our procedure is to estimate the "market"

wage of an individual given his attributes. We suppose that the youth whose
wage rates we measure are only a portion of those who would have measured

wage rates in the absence of the minimum. In particular, some persons who
would otherwise be employed and thus have an observed market wage below the

minimum do not have an observed wage rate. We proceeded as though our
sample were drawn from a group that, in the absence of the minimum, would
have measured wages, but if an individual had a market wage less than M,
the observation was retained, assigned the value M, or thrown out with
probabilities P1, P2, and 1 - P1

-

P2

respectively.1

Consider first the wage function parameter estimates, the s's. To
motivate the relationship between our estimates and the least squares results, we have graphed in Figure 7 the hypothesized market relationship

1. We did not constrain by functional form P1 + P2 to be less than 1.

between average area wage rates and youth wages.

With the establishment of the minimum wage at M, some persons who
would be employed and have observed market wage rates below M are not
employed and thus not in the sample, while others have wage rates equal

to M; some remain employed with wage rates below M. Thus as shown by the
dashed line in Figure 7, if the minimum had the hypothesized effect on
employment, least squares estimates would underestimate the relationship
between average area wage rates and the underlying market wage.'

We see from Table 1, that this is indeed the case. Our estimates
of the coefficient on area wage is 22 percent higher than the least squares

estimate. Similar expectations and estimated results apply to other variables.

1. This truncated distribution result is similar to the case discussed by Hausman and Wise [1977], in which the truncation was complete and
at the upper end of the distribution.

-24-

For example, our schooling coefficient is 28 percent

higer

than the least

squares estimate; our coefficient on age is 28 percent higher.

Apparent-

ly persons from low wage areas and with personal attributes that are associated with lower market wages tend either to be excluded from the sample or

to have wage distributions with concentrations at the minimum.'

And our estimatedvalues of P1 and P2 are consistent with the relationship between our estimated slope parameters and least squares estimates.

Our estimated value of P1 (.231) indicates the 23 percent of persons with
market wages below the minimum continue to be employed at wages below M,
while the estimate of P2 (.338) indicates that 34 percent of this group re-

ceive wages equal to the minimum. Thus 43 percent (1 -

P1

P2)

of those

who have market wages below the minimum and would otherwise be employed are
not employed, according to these estimates.

We would

also expect--based on

Figure 7 for example-- that given

characteristics X, the variance of observed wage rates would be lower than

the variance of market wage rates, and our estimates are consistent with

this intuition. Our estimate of the standard error of wage rates (a) is
.335 while the least squares estimate is .296.

Because our methodology emphasizes the interaction between an individual's market wage and the impact of the minimum--in particular that the effect
will be greater on workers with lower market wages--we also emphasize the

substantial estimated effects of race and sex on market wage rates. Holding the other variables constant, women earn 22 percent less than men and

Estimates for subgroups (not shown) are also consistent with this
expectation. For youth 16 to 17, who have relatively low market wages, our
estimated area wage coefficient of .065 is 1.6 times as large as the least
squares estimate of .040. For women 16 to 24 our estimate is 2.7 times as
large as the least squares estimate (.049 versus .018 respectively).

blacks 7 percent less than whites. These estimates suggest that we should
predict a greater impact of the minimum on women and blacks than on white men.
Union members in this age group according to our estimates have a
"market' wage 37 percent higher than non—union youth, holding other attri-

butes constant. The wage rates of most union members are well above the
minimum. Youth working part-time earn 19 percent less than those working
full-time.

In the subsequent analysis we have eliminated the union and part-time

variables because they are essentially endogenous. Both union and membership and part-time work are likely to depend in part on education and age,
for example, and part-time at least may indeed be affected by the minimum

wage. These variables also are available only for persons who are employed and would thus have to be inferred in the two-equation model described

below. To limit the number of variables in the model, we also have eliminated the three regional dummies. In general, we found that regional effects-other than for the West--were not significantly different from zero after
inclusion of the area wage and unemployment variables.

2. Estimates for Selected Groups of Men
Parameter estimates for selected groups of out-of-school male youth

are shown in Table 2. The estimates for each group are based on all the
observations in the survey that are in that group. Of most interest are
the values for P1 and P2. For all male youth between 16 and 24, the
estimates indicate that approximately 32 percent of persons who would have
jobs with market wages below the minimum are excluded from employment by

the minimum. Black youth are somewhat more likely than whites to be

percent versus 29 percent.1 According to these estimates,

differential effects of the minimum on these groups arise both from
differences among the groups in market wage rates, dependent on the
personal characteristics X, and differences in the probability of being
hired given a market wage rate below the minimum.

The estimates for 16 to 24 year old black and white youth together
imply that on average blacks earn 11 percent less than whites with the
same measured characteristics (the coefficient on the black variable is

-.107), For the younger group, however, the estimated black versus white
effect is zero.

The estimates of P1 and P2 also differ by age group. Teenagers with
market wages below the minimum are more likely than youth 20 to 24 to be

hired at these wage rates. Differences in the jobs held by the two
groups relative to the minimum wage legislation coverage we believe to

be a likely explanation for this finding. We cannot rule out differences
in compliance rates, however.

On the other hand, teenagers who would otherwise be hired at market
rates less than the minimum are slightly more likely than 20 to 24 year

olds to be hired at the minimum. One explanation is that according to
our estimates the variance of underlying market rates is smaller for
teenagers than for older young persons.

Thus among out-of-school teen-

agers, market rates below the minimum are bunched closer to the minimum

It is possible that the black youth are less likely than whites
to be hired at the minimum--if their market wage rates are below the
minimum--because the expected value of market wage rates below the
minimum is lower for blacks than for whites, and for this reason their
wage rates less likely to be raised to the minimum.

than are the sub-minimum market rates of older youth. It also seems
probable to us that given measured characteristics X, sub-minimum market
wage rates are more likely among older workers than among teenagers to

be associated with poor employee attributes. If this were true, presumably employers would be less willing to "take a chance" with older workers and hire them at the minimum.
In sum, these estimates indicate that approximately 32 percent of men

16 to 24 with market wage rates below the minimum are without work because

of it. Contrary to our expectation at least, our estimates imply that
less than 20 percent of 16 to 17 year olds with market wage rates below the
minimum are displaced by it.

3. An Empirical versus a Predicted Distribution
Unlike most more traditional methods of analysis, the distributional

assumptions play a key role in our work. It has become standard practice
to assume that wage functions are log-normal, and the results reported

above are based on a log-normal distribution as well. However, to check
the sensitivity of our results to this assumption and to determine a "best"
fit, we also experimented with other distributions, using a Box-Cox transformation of wage rates.1

A comparison of the empirical distribution of wage rates by interval for
all male youth 16 to 24 versus the predicted distribution based on the lognormal wage distribution is shown in Figure 8.

It appears from the graph

that the fit is quite close, especially at the tails where alternative

1. See footnote 1, page 15.

-30-

distributions are likely to give different results. Thus if we can fit
the tails in particular, we have added confidence in our results. The
actual percentages below the minimum, at the minimum (interval), and
above $5.90 are 4.9, 15.6, and 21.1 respectively; the predicted percent-

ages are 5.0, 16.1, and 18.8. No continuous distribution, of course, can
capture precisely the pile-up of wage rates at "magnet" values like $3.00,
$4.00, or $5.00.

A somewhat some formal way to measure the fit is to calculate a chisquare statistic based on the differences between the empirical and predicted

frequencies within the intervals. The statistic:

J
=

(n

-

)2

j=l

(where n is the number of observations in the th interval, and J is the
number of intervals) has a chi-square distribution with N-(J -

1

+ K) degrees

of freedom, where K is the number of parameters estimated in our model.

Among a wide range of distributions that we tried, the log-normal gives

the smallest chi—square value. It is very much smaller than the chi-square
value based on the assumption of normality for example (286.1 versus
548. 7).

III. A More Complete Model: Employment and Wages
The results of the simple model are based only on the distribution
of wage rates among youth who reported an hourly wage rate (plus a small

number of youth for whom we could calculate a wage from reported weekly

earnings and hours). Among the 24,305 youth 16 to 24 included in the
May 1978 Current Population Survey, the distribution by employment and
hourly versus salaried workers is as follows:

The estimates in Section II were based on the distribution of wages among
sub—groups of out-of-school youth with reported waç'e rates.'

The data, however, contain much more information than wage rates. In
particular, they contain information on employment status. Although it is
plausible under our assumptions to base estimates only on the wage data and
from them to infer employment effects, it is clear that more robust estimates
could be obtained by combining the wage data with the information on employ-

ment status. Intuitively, it appears that the addition of employment data

1.

To obtain adequate sample sizes we used all youth in some categories.

-33-

should make the estimates less dependent on distributional assumtions.
In using both employment and wage data, we must also account for those
youth who are employed, but for whom we do not have a reported wage.

We will show that the single equation model is a special case of
this more general model and is a correct model if the disturbance terms

in the wage and employment equations are uncorrelated. But in this model,
a zero correlation does not mean that employment and wage equations can

be estimated separately with no loss of information. Indeed a market
employment equation cannot be estimated without considering a wage function

as well. And estimating the two equations jointly provides additional
information on wage rates, even with a zero correlation. As usual, the
use of more information constrains the parameter estimates to reflect more
empirical fact and to this extent provides better estimates, but in this
case the information does not "separate" as might be expected on the basis
of experience with more standard models.

A. A Two-Equation Model
In addition to an underlying wage distribution that would exist in

the absence of the minimum wage, we shall incorporate explicitly an

lying employment relationship. Again, it is useful to think of a group of
individuals with measured attributes X. Suppose that in the absence of a
minimum wage, the employment and wage relationships would be of the form

E = Xc +

For expository purposes we shall pause for a moment and consider a
diagram that relates the values of E, W, and R to the possible outcomes
in the presence of a minimum wage, as shown in Figure 9. The entries with-

in the diagram pertain to outcomes with a minimum wage. The notation on

be employed in the absence

of a minimum, a wage would be reported. The lined area indicates the proportion of the group who would not be employed with a minimum wage. Those
added to this
with E < 0 would not be employed without the minimum and
group are those with W < M who are not employed with a minimum--the two
areas indicated by 1 - P1

-

P2.

Some of the latter group would have a re-

ported wage and others would not. We observe hourly wage rates for persons
schematically included in the shaded area.

(This was the group used in

the procedure described in Section II. From this group we estimated P1
and P2.) The remaining group we observe to be employed but we don't ob-

serve their wage rates. Our goal then is to describe the probability of
the possible outcomes.

To do this we assume that E and W (a transformation of the wage rate)

are distributed bivariate normal. To facilitate computation--and we believe without appreciably altering the results--we suppose, as noted above,

that the unmeasured determinants of the underlying employment and wage
equations on the one hand and the unmeasured determinants of whether a

wage is reported on the other, are not correlated. This allows us to pro-

ceed with a bivariate instead of a trivariate distribution) For the ease
of exposition we have only specified two relationships in equation (5). We

where 0 is as defined in equation (2). The distribution of observed wage
rates, conditional on observing a wage, can be derived by dividing equations

(9,ii), (9,iii), and (9,iv), by (10). This gives the same result as equation (2)
in Section II describing h(w), since the expression R.[Xa] multiplies
each term in the numerator and denominator of each of the three parts of

the conditional density function (and cancels out). Thus, given our
assumptions, consistent estimates can be obtained from the single equation

model if p =

0.

There is no analagous employment equation that does not depend on the

wage function, however. Thus even though p =

0,

estimation of the two

equations jointly provides information that cannot be duplicated by
estimating each separately.

B. Estimates Based on the Two—Equation Model
Parameter estimates for the two-equation model based on all out-ofschool young men 16 to 24 and for those 20 to 24 are presented in Table 3.

They may be compared with the single equation estimates in the first and

fourth columns of Table 2. The sample used in the single equation estimation can be thought of as contained in but comprising only part of the data

used in the two-equation estimation. The sample of all men in the 16 to
24 age group, within which the 3005 with an hourly wage rate were included,
is distributed by employment category as follows:

our assumptions, that the single-equation estimates should be approximately

of the correct order of magnitude, although the simulated results using
both salary and hourly workers may differ from those based on hourly wage

workers only. The two-equation estimates for P1 and P2 don't differ greatly from the single-equation counterparts--.27 versus

.23 and .53 versus

.45 respectively for the 16 to 24 age groups and .27 versus .23 and .46

versus .45 for those 20 to 24. Recall that the single equation estimates
are based only on hourly wage workers.

The two-equation model incorporates

both hourly and salaried workers--for whom we do not have a wage rate--

and we assume that the same wage function and P1 and P2 values apply to

both groups. The impact of the minimum on salaried workers may well differ
from the effect on wage workers; the information we have on the salaried

group is apparently too weak to verify this.1

1. Because there is a large potential error in hourly wage rates
hours worked, much of the
estimated by using reported salaries and normal
precision of actual wage rates is lost. The wage distributions for salaried workers that we generated using the ratio of salaries to hours, however, suggest that salaried workers with market wages below the minimum
the
may be more likely than comparable hourly workers to be employed below
minimum, and less likely to be employed at the minimum.

-43-

IV. Simulations
We shall present first simulations based on the single-equation
model and then additional ones based on the two-equation specification.
The single—equation version is somewhat easier to work with and, because
the relevant parameter estimates do not differ greatly from one to the
other, we have presented some details that could be obtained based on the

two-equation estimates but were not. Although the estimated employment impact of the minimum varies somewhat depending on the model, the general

implications do not. Some results, however, are impossible to infer from

the single-equation estimates only. Such results are presented in the
second part of this section. In particular, we are able to infer the
distribution of non-employment by market wage rate, with and without the
minimum.

A. Simulations Based on the Single-Equation Model
From the estimates in Table 1 we may by simulation obtain estimates

of the effects of the minimum wage on the employment and wage rates of

these youth. These estimates are summarized in the tabulation below.

The

simulations use all observations used in estimation and allow for weighting
of these observations depending on the likelihood that an individual with
attributes X who would have been employed with the minimum is not observed

with a wage because of the minimum. The numbers thus pertain to hourly

ge workers only. All of the estimates pertain to 1978 as well. Thus
the implication of lowering the minimum, for example, from $2.65 to $2.30

should be thought of in terms of 1978 dollars. The simulation methodology
is explained in detail in Appendix A.

If there were no minimum wage, according to row 1, the number of
male youth between 16 and 24 with jobs would be 6.8 percent higher than
it is (1978) now.

It would be only 3.6 percent higher for those 20 to

24 and 9.5 percent higher among those 16 to 17.

Around the level of the minimum wage, the estimates of employment
elasticities with respect to changes in the minimum are approximately

20 percent, but are considerably lower for the older group. Our
methodology allows the elasticity to vary depending upon the level of

the minimum relative to the underlying distribution of wage rates. Thus

-45-

while standard estimates require that a single estimated elasticity
be used to extrapolate employment effects for all levels of the minimum,

our procedure allows the employment effect of an incremental change in

the minimum to depend on its level. The closer the minimum is to the
central tendency of the wage distribution, the greater the elasticity.

A comparison of the elasticities for 20 to 24 and 16 to 17 year olds

reveals this property. The minimum wage is much lower than the central
tendency of the wage distribution of the older youth but above the
central tendency of the wage rates of the younger group.

Our estimates suggest that reductiorin the minimum would have
relatively large effects down to about $2.00; but are close to zero

below $1.50. For the group as a whole, the estimated marginal effects
on employment of successive reducttons in the mtnimum are as follows:

-

At a minimum of $1.50, our simulations indicate that the expected
wage of youth ($4.07) is approximately equal to the estimated expected

market wage of $4.05. As shown above, at about $1.50 further reduction
in the minimum would have virtually no effect on employment.

-46-

The fourth row of the tabulation on page 44 shows the expected wage

of those employed, given the existinq minimum. By comparison of the fifth
and sixth rows, it can be seen that because some youth who would be employed in the absence of the minimum are not employed, the expected wage of the
total group that would have been employed without the minimum is lower with

it than without it. The expected market wage of the total group is shown
in row 6. The increase of wages of some youth from below the minimum up
to the minimum is more than offset by non-employment (zero wages) of others.
The average difference is 9 cents per hour.1
The expected market wage of $2.49 for the 16 to 17 age group is well

below the minimum wage of $2.65. To the extent that this figure is accepted, it is not surprising that the estimated employment effect is relatively large for this group.

According to our model, the wage effects are concentrated on

persons who would otherwise be paid below the minimum. Thus for these
sub-minimum workers, the loss in expected wages is greater than indicated

by the numbers above. For all youth with sub-minimum market wages,
the expected wage is 10 percent lower with than without the minimum

($2.06 versus $1.83). The loss is 9.1 percent for whites ($2.08 versus
$1.89) and 13.1 percent for blacks ($1.98 versus $1.72). It is 14.3 percent
for teenagers 16 and 17 ($2.17 versus $1.86). Only for older youth 20

1. The estimates in rows 4, 5, and 6 were obtained by estimating
logarithm values first and then converting these to absolute values. Thus
there may be some error because of the non-linearities involved, but we
believe that the relative magnitudes are not affected substantially.

-47-

to 24 is there essentially no effect of the minimum wage on the expected
wage of sub-minimum wage workers (an estimated gain of 2.4 percent).
Finally, we have applied the parameter estimates based

on hourly wage

workers to all those employed, both hourly and salaried. This allows us to
estimate the total number of out-of-school young men that would be employ-

ed if the minimum were eliminated. For the total group, we can also compare
observed employment ratios with simulated ratios without the minimum.

These values are given, by selected subgroups, in the tabulation below.
It is often argued that the minimum wage has a greater effect on black
than on white youth employment,

presumably because of the lower levels of

education and other wage related attributes among black youth. Our results

are consistent with this claim. That is, according to these
if the minimum were eliminated, employment

estimates,

among black youth would be in-

creased by 12 percent, while employment of white youth would be increased

by only 5 percent. Nonetheless, only 30 percent of the difference between
the employment ratios of black and white youth is due to the minimum, according to our estimates.

of the 5997 persons in our sample, with and without the minimum. Of
persons with market wage rates below the minimum, who without the minimum

are employed, 20 percent (180) are without work with the minimum. According to these simulations, elimination of the minimum would increase total

employment among young men by 3.6 percent. (The percent employed would
increase from 84.6 percent to 87.5 percent.) The single-equation model
based on 3005 hourly wage employees only implied that their number would

be increased by 6.8 percent, if the minimum were eliminated. The singleequation wage model when applied to all 5066 employed persons (i.e.,

-49-

hourly and salaried workers) predicts an increase of 6.6 percent, as com-

pared with 3.6 percent based on the two-equation model. It is to be expected that because a smaller proportion of salaried than hourly workers
have market wages below the minimum, the percentage effect on both groups

would be smaller than on hourly workers only. The difference between the
two-equation and single—equation results, however, is apparently due only
in small part to this fact.
There are other characteristics of the simulations that we find strik-

ing. Without a minimum, among youth with market wages below the minimum,
16 percent would not be employed, while of those with market wage rates a-

bove the minimum, 12 percent would not be employed. With the minimum, 32
percent of the sub-minimum wage group are not employed. Thus the results
suggest that low wage workers would be disproportionately without work in
either case, but the minimum wage magnifies substantially the difference

between the employment rates of the two groups. Without a minimum, only
23 percent of non-employment is accounted for by those with sub-minimum
market wages, while with the minimum this group accounts for 38 percent of
non-employment.

It is of course impossible to infer these results without jointly

estimating the wage and employment equations together. We need both
market employment and market wage estimates, neither of which can be estimated without taking account of the effect of the minimum itself on each
of them.

Employment among this age group, if the minimum were eliminated, would be

3ccording to these estimates. (For this age group, virtually the same
estimate is obtained by applying the single-equation parameter estimates
to all employed young men, both hourly and salaried.)

And again, we ob-

serve that the minimum tends to increase the concentration of non-employ-

ment among low-wage youth. Without the minimum, the estimated 12.4 percent
of those with below-minimum market wages who are not employed account for
only 15.4 percent of non-employment, while with the minimum the 40.3 percent of the sub-minimum group who are not employed account for 37.1 per-

cent of those withoutwork.

Discussion and Conclusions

Our results imply that if there were no minimum wage, the number of
out-of-school young men who are employed would be 4 to 6 percent higher

than it is now. Among hourly workers, the effect is apparently the
largest. Possibly one-half of the potential increase in employment could

be gained by a 15 percent decrease in the minimum. Although the potential
percentage increase in employment is greater for younger than for older

youth, more older youth are employed. In 1978, for example, there were
601,000 employed males 16 and 17 who were not in school, and 6,735,000

male students 20 to 24. Thus a 9.5 percent increase for those 16 to 17
(from our single-equation results) would be 57,000, whereas a 3.6 percent

increase for 20 to 24 year olds would be 242,000. These data apply to
out-of-school youth, however, and most youth 16 to 17 are in school.

Our estimates imply also that the likelihood that a male non-student
youth 16 or 17 with a market wage below the minimum is employed at or
below the minimum is greater than the likelihood for older workers--.85

versus .69. Thus for example, whether a youth minimum is desirable, as
opposed say to a reduction in the minimum, depends on the goals of the

reduction. The effect on individuals of different ages may not be the
same as the aggregate effects by age group.

The average wage paid to youth according to our estimates is lower

with the minimum than it would be without it. Although those youth who
are employed earn more on average than they would without the minimum,
the increase for these youth is more than offset by the non-employment

of others. Thus those least well-off without the minimum bear a

—52—

disproportionate share of the cost of the minimum wage legislation.
Because increases in wage rates come to a large extent with work
experience, reduced work experience when young results in substantially

reduced wage rates when older. Thus the total effect of the minimum
on these low-market-wage workers is likely to be greater than the effect
implied by the point-in-time estimates reported in the paper.

There are, of course, several possible effects of the minimum wage

that our analysis does not address. We have set forth a model that we
believe captures the primary postulated effects of the minimum wage as

they are described by most researchers. In particular, we have assumed
that the effect would be concentrated on persons who would otherwise

receive wages below the minimum. Although economic theory suggests that
substitution of higher quality for lower quality workers, for example,

may raise the wage rates of workers with market wages above the minimum,
the first order effect is thought to be on low wage persons.

It may also

be that increases in the minimum wage have an inflationary effect on the
wage rates paid to all workers and thus shift upward the underlying dis-

tribution of wage rates. Such effects could be estimated if both time
series and cross-section data were used and we will do that in future
research.

It can be demonstrated that a purely inflationary shift in the

underlying distribution would affect our estimated elasticities with
respect to a change in the minimum, but not our estimated total employ-

ment effects, were the minimum to be eliminated. (This is explained in
more detail in Appendix A.)

—53-

The minimum wage may also affect school attendance rates. Thus far

we have restricted our formal analysis to out-of-school youth. A possible
extension of our model would incorporate a school attendance equation or
would use the model as is to obtain separate estimated effects for youth
in school.

It may also be that the minimum wage affects hours worked, even

among employed youth. For example, youth may be more likely to work part-

time with a minimum than without it. Explicit allowance for this possibility, as well as effects on school attendance, we believe would tend if
anything to increase the employment effect of the minimum if employment
were 'adjusted" to account for these possible effects.2

1. Most part-time workers are students and are therefore excluded
in large part from our analysis.
2. Sherwin Rosen in his discussion has also pointed out that our data
excludes military personnel and the minimum wage may interact with enlistments, possibly for young men just out of high school in particular.

A Shift in the Wage Distribution: As mentioned in the text, it is
sometimes argued that the minimum wage has a purely inflationary effect on
all wages; that is, it shifts upward the wage rates paid to all workers.

A-6

Within the context of our model, we could in this case think of the effect of

the minimum in two parts: first, it shifts all wages upward, and second,
persons remain employed or lose their jobs according to the mechanism
we have described, but with respect to this "shifted' distribution.
Using only cross-section data, we are unable to estimate the magnitude

of such shifts if they do occur, but we could do sousing both
cross section and time series data. We will do this in future research.
In the meantime, we note that such shifts would not affect our estimates
of lost employment resulting from the minimum, although they would affect

our employment elasticity estimates with respect to a change in the
minimum.

That is, with a purely inflationary increase in the underlying
distribution, the total employment loss is the increase in employment that
would result, given the shifted distribution, if the minimum were eliminated.
To test the sensitivity of our elasticity estimates to such shifts-with changes in the minimum—-we have calculated them assuming selected
shifts in the underlying wage distribution, using the single equation

model. As in the text we begin by assuming that without a minimum the
logarithm of the wage rate is given by

(A-14)

ln W =

X

+ e

But in this case, we assume in addition that with a minimum

all wages

are shifted upward by an amount S(M) so that without the discontinuities
caused by the minimum, wage rates would be given by

(A-15)

w(M) =

w.s(M)

A- 7

and in W(M) by

(A-16)

in W(M) =

X

+ in

+

S(M)

In this case, the shift associated with the minimum M is simply embodied in
our estimated constant term.

Relative to the underlying wage rates with the current minimum M, wage
rates with another minimum

would be given by
S(M.)

(A—17)

wi t

_____

W(M) =

h

(A-18)

in W(M) =

X

+

c + in

S(M.)
S(M)

Our modei of course does not provide estimates of the last term, but the
sensitivity of our elasticity results can be checked by substituting for

X, in the lost employment calculations, X + K, where K is a selected
value for in [S(M)/S(M)]. For example, we could assume that a 15 percent
reduction in the minimum would shift the underlying distribution down by

5 percent so that S(M)/S(M) would be .95.

We can demonstrate now that a shift as described above would not affect

the estimate of jobs lost as a result of the minimum. To see this, we
have rewritten equation (A-2), to allow for the shift parameter, as

M —
(A—19)

L. =

' i=l

— ln(S(M.)/S(M)
a

(l—P,—P2)
I

A-8

The denominator depends only on the current minimum. At the current

minimum, M =

M

and the shift term is equal to zero. Thus our estimate

of the non-employment effect of the present minimum is not affected by

possible shifting of the underlying wage distribution. However, simulated
employment elasticities based on a comparison of L with some Lk will
depend on the shift term. They will be somewhat lower, depending on the
magnitude of the shift.
