    "abstract": "\n\nThe random coefficients, multinomial choice logit model has been widely used in empirical choice analysis for the last 30 years. We are the first to prove that the distribution of random coefficients in this model is nonparametrically identified. Our approach exploits the structure of the logit model, and so requires no monotonicity assumptions and requires variation in product characteristics within only an infinitesimally small open set. Our identification argument is constructive and may be applied to other choice models with random coefficients.\n\n",
