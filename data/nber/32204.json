    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the multigenerational impact of children and whether the public provision of formal childcare lessens the earnings and employment impacts of children. We find that the arrival of a firstborn reduces employment and earnings of mothers and employment of grandmothers. Studying a universal childcare program in Quebec, we find formal childcare increases the employment rates of mothers, as well as that of grandmothers to a lesser extent. Examining heterogeneity of the program's impact across Census Divisions, we find a negative correlation between the positive effects on mothers' employment and the pre-policy supply of informal childcare by grandmothers.\n\n",
