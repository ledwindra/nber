    "abstract": "\n\nThe standard version of q theory, in which investment is positively related to marginal q, breaks down in the presence of fixed costs of adjustment.  With fixed costs, investment is a non-monotonic function of q.  Therefore its inverse, which is the traditional investment function, does not exist.  Depending upon auxiliary assumptions, the correlation between investment and marginal q can be either positive or negative.  Given certain homogeneity assumptions, a version of the theory based on average q still holds, although under the same assumptions profits and sales perform as well as average q. More generally, q is no longer a sufficient statistic.\n\n",
