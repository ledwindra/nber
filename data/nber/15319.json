CHAT is an unbalanced panel dataset with information on the adoption of over 100 technologies in more than 150 countries since 1800.  The data is available for download at: http://www.nber.org/data/chat We discuss the main aim of CHAT, its scope and limitations, as well as several ways in which we have used the data so far and ways to potentially use the data for other research.\n\n",
