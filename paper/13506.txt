ABSTRACT
UK population growth over the past thirty-five years has been remarkably low in comparison with
other countries; the population grew by just 7% between 1971 and 2004, less than all the other EU15
countries. The UK population has grown at a faster pace since the turn of the millennium. Both the
inflow and outflow rates have risen, but the inflow rate has risen more rapidly recently, with an influx
of workers from Eastern European. The propensity to come to the UK to work is higher the lower
is a) GDP per capita b) life satisfaction in each of the East European countries. There is reason to believe
that the majority of those who have arrived in the UK from Eastern Europe have not come permanently.
When surveyed only 9% said they expected to stay for more than two years. Hence, in our view it
is inappropriate to call them migrants, whereas in fact they should more appropriately be considered
temporary or guest workers. There is evidence that, as a result of this increase in the flow of workers
from Eastern Europe, the fear of unemployment has risen in the UK which appears to have contained
wage pressures. We argue that the influx of workers from Eastern Europe has tended to increase supply
by more than it has increased demand in the UK (in the short run). We argue that this has acted to
reduce inflationary pressures and reduce the natural rate of unemployment.

Executive Summary
a) UK population growth over the past thirty-five years has been remarkably low in
comparison with other countries; the population grew by just 7% between 1971 and 2004,
less than all the other EU15 countries (except Germany), as well as Australia, Canada,
Japan, New Zealand and the United States, plus China and India.
b) The UK population has grown at a faster pace since the turn of the millennium. This
recent growth has been driven primarily by changes in net migration. Both the inflow
and outflow rates have risen, but the inflow rate has risen more rapidly recently, with an
influx of workers from Eastern European. However, the increase in net migration also
reflects a steady rise in the number of immigrants from Asia and the Middle East.
c) The propensity to come to the UK to work is higher the lower is GDP per capita in
each of the East European countries. The decision is also strongly negatively correlated
with life satisfaction scores and positively correlated with unemployment rates, but is
uncorrelated with employment rates or rates of inflation.
d) There is reason to believe that the majority of those who have arrived in the UK from
Eastern Europe have not come permanently. When surveyed only 9% said they expected
to stay for more than two years. Hence, in our view it is inappropriate to call them
migrants, whereas in fact they should more appropriately be considered temporary or
guest workers.
e) There appears to be consistent evidence from the Worker Registration Scheme and
National Insurance Number applications that over 600,000 people from Eastern Europe
had come to the UK between May 2004 and March 2007. However, at any moment of
time it is likely that approximately half of these workers have returned to their country of
origin.
f) The empirical literature from around the world suggests little or no evidence that
immigrants have had a major impact on native labour market outcomes, such as wages
and unemployment. Recent work by a number of other authors for the UK is also
consistent with this view.
(g) There is evidence that the fear of unemployment has risen recently in the UK. This is
likely to have contained wage pressures.
(h) We argue that the influx of workers from Eastern Europe has tended to increase
supply by more than it has increased demand in the UK (in the short run). We argue that
this has acted to reduce inflationary pressures and reduce the natural rate of
unemployment.

0) Introduction
The recent rise in migration to the UK from eight EU Accession countries (the Czech
Republic; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Poland; Slovakia; and Slovenia – the A8
countries) which started in 2004, as well as subsequently from Romania and Bulgaria (the
A2) in 2007, has generated a good deal of controversy. We will refer to these countries
collectively as the A10 henceforth.1 How many of these East European immigrants are
there currently in the UK? Which countries did they come from and when? What impact
has their influx had on the UK economy and what likely impacts will they have in the
future?
We attempt to address these questions here. First, we examine changes in the UK
population since the 1970s and note that growth has been very low by international
standards. The UK population has, however, grown at a faster pace since the turn of the
millennium, driven most recently by migration from the A8 nations and, to a much lesser
extent, from the A2. It appears that the propensity to come to the UK from these
countries is higher the lower is GDP per capita. Second, we examine the evidence on the
numbers of individuals from the A10 who have arrived in the UK in recent years. There
is broad agreement from the various data sources on the numbers involved – six hundred
thousand workers is likely to be an upper bound for the stock who are in the UK in mid
2007. Many of these individuals have stayed in the UK for only a short time and then
returned home, to possibly return again at a later date. Our view is that these individuals
should not actually be treated as migrants per se, but are primarily temporary or guest
workers. Third, we examine the characteristics of the recent flow of individuals from the
A10 countries that have arrived in the UK since accession, and find that they are
relatively young, male, have high employment rates, low unemployment rates, lower
wages, and high self-employment rates and are especially likely to be in temporary jobs.
They appear to have very different characteristics than immigrants from non-A10
countries. Fourth, we examine the evidence suggesting that the fear of unemployment in
the UK has risen over recent years and the consequences of that finding. We find that the
fear of losing one’s job lowers wage pressure. Fifth, we turn to the macroeconomic
implications of A10 migration to the UK, and argue that this immigration has made the
labour market more flexible and likely lowered the natural rate of unemployment and
reduced inflationary pressures. Section six summarises the main findings.
1) Population changes and UK immigration policy
According to official estimates published by the Office for National Statistics, the UK
population grew by just 8.2% between 1971 and 2006, from 55.9 million to 60.5 million.
In contrast, the United States population grew by 44.6% over the same period, from 207.7
million in 1971 to 300.3 million in 2006.2 Indeed population growth across most
advanced countries has been greater than in the UK over the past three decades. Over the
period 1971-2004, population growth in the UK ranks 31st out of 38 European and other
large nations for which data are available (see Table 1), with only Germany (East and
West) and seven East European countries having had slower population growth (Czech

Residents of Cyprus and Malta were also permitted to work in the UK from 2004, but the size of the flows
are small and hence we concentrate on the more important flows from the Eastern European ten.

Republic; Croatia; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria). All the other major
industrialised nations have had faster rates of population growth. Growth was
particularly rapid in the US (+42%) as noted above, but also in Australia (+54%); Canada
(+45%); Spain (+25%); Japan (+21%); and France (+18%). The Indian population
roughly doubled over the same period (96%), while the Chinese population grew by 52%.
It is clear that UK population growth has been extremely low by international standards.
Long-run trends, however, mask some significant short-run changes in population
growth. The UK population grew by 2.8 million (4.9%) between 1971 and 1999, but the
population had subsequently risen by approximately another one and a half million by the
end of 2005 (Table 2a). The main cause of this increase has been a rise in net inward
migration, driven by an increase in the inflow rate to the UK; the outflow rate has
remained little changed over the years, although there has been a pickup since 1998. The
ratio of births to deaths has seen less variation. In 2004/5 net migration accounted for
two-thirds of the change in population (248/375). To place these numbers in some degree
of context, net (legal) migration in the United States accounted for approximately one
third of net population growth in 2004/5.3 Table 2b makes it clear that the scale of net
inward migration to the UK has been much lower than in most other EU countries until
recently, and even now remains well below the levels of both Italy and Spain.
Since UK population growth appears to have been extremely low by international
standards over the past three decades it would seem likely that the UK has the capacity to
absorb a reasonably large number of immigrants without undesirable consequences. As
we note below, it appears that it has already done so to a considerable degree; the entry of
A10 workers appears to have improved the workings of the labour market, reduced wage
and inflationary pressures and lowered the natural rate of unemployment.
The increase in the net flow of workers to the UK since the turn of the millennium
coincides with changes in UK immigration policy and the relative attractiveness of the
UK’s economic position over the past decade. Most recently the increase in the inflow
rate of migrants is in large part attributable to immigration policies that accompanied the
accession of the A8 countries on May 1st 2004, and the A2 on January 1st 2007.4 Citizens
from the A8 nations obtained free movement and the right to work in the UK, Ireland and
Sweden from May 1st 2004,5 although they have to register on the Worker Registration
Scheme (WRS) and also register to obtain National Insurance numbers. The WRS does
not apply to Bulgarian and Romanian nationals, and access to the UK labour market is
more restricted. Skilled workers from the A2 with the ‘right qualifications and

In addition Malta and (South) Cyprus also joined the EU at that date. Bulgaria and Romania joined the
EU on January 1st 2007.

Finland, Greece, Portugal and Spain opened their labour markets to these workers on May 1st 2006, while
Italy followed in late July 2006. Five other countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and

experience’ are allowed to take up specific jobs where there is no suitable UK applicant,
while workers can also enter through the Highly Skilled Migrants Programme. Lowskilled migration from Bulgaria and Romania is restricted to those sectors of the economy
where the UK already has low-skilled schemes and is subject to a strict quota capped at
20,000 workers per year. Furthermore, A2 workers’ rights to work on these schemes are
limited to six months, which means that they are not entitled to access benefits or public
housing. As with the A8, the self-employed are able to work in the UK, but must be able
to prove they are genuinely self-employed. Bulgarian and Romanian students can study
in the UK and seek part-time employment during their stay, but need a work authorisation
document to do so.6
But why move to a foreign country in the first place? The literature focuses on the
economic factors that determine migration. Very simply, the literature says that
individuals will compare the income benefits from migration with the economic and
social costs of moving. If the benefits outweigh the costs, they may choose to migrate.
The gain from moving will be calculated as the expected income differential between the
destination country and the country of origin, which will in turn be determined by the
relative probability of getting a job – captured by differences in the unemployment or
employment rates.
The empirical literature from around the world suggests little or no evidence that
immigrants have had a major impact on native labour market outcomes such as wages
and unemployment. Recent work by a number of other authors for the UK is also
consistent with this view (see Blanchflower et al, 2007 for a fuller discussion).
Naskoteen and Zimmer (1980) find for the US that a 10 percentage point increase in the
wage differential between the countries of destination and origin increases the probability
of migration by 7 percentage points. Borjas (2005) finds that a 10 percentage point
increase in the rate of employment growth in the state of origin reduces the probability of
migration by approximately 2 percent. There is also evidence that migration is most
common among younger and more educated workers (Borjas 2005). Moreover, workers
who have just migrated are extremely likely to move back to their original locations. The
probability of a migrant returning to the state of origin within a year is about 13 per cent
and the probability of moving to another location is 15 per cent (Devanzo, 1983 and
Dustmann, 2003). Zaiceva (2006) summarises the empirical literature on potential
European migration flows, which she shows to be consistent with between 2 and 4 per
cent of the residents of Central and East European countries (CEECS) moving West, in
the long run, constituting around 1 per cent of the EU15 population. Zaiceva also
presents evidence from simulations suggesting that the majority of migrants will be from
Romania, Poland and Bulgaria, consistent with other estimates from the literature.
Gilpin et al (2006) examine whether A8 citizens have come to the UK because it offers a
higher standard of living (GDP per capita) or a higher probability of getting a job
(measured by the inverse of the unemployment rate), or both. They examine data from
the Worker Registration Scheme (WRS), which is described in detail below, and compute

the number of WRS registrations as a percentage of the home country population and
show it is correlated with GDP and unemployment. We update their analysis in Table 3.
It is apparent that a larger fraction of people from Lithuania (1.85%); Latvia (1.43%);
Slovakia (1.13%) and Poland (1.02%) have come to the UK compared to Estonia
(0.47%), the Czech Republic (0.28), Hungary (0.19) and Slovenia (0.03) (Table 3).
Gilpin et al. find that countries with the lowest GDP per head, such as Lithuania (2,500
Euros) are more likely to be registered on the UK WRS than those from countries with
higher GDP, such as Slovenia (11,400 Euros).7 Workers in the WRS data are also more
likely to come from countries with the highest unemployment rates, such as Poland
(19.0%). Pedersen et al (2004) found similar effects for GDP per capita and the
unemployment rate in both source and destination countries in their study of migration
flows into OECD countries in the 1990s. Hughes (2007) found that GDP per capita was
also a good predictor of flows from the A8 to Ireland.
The correlation coefficient is clearly highest with 2005 GDP per head, as noted by Gilpin
et al., and even higher when GDP is in logs (r=-0.832). The correlation is slightly weaker
with the unemployment rate, but especially low with the employment rate.8
Interestingly, Schiopu and Siegfried (2006) found that the difference in GDP between the
host and home countries increases the size of remittances.
Data are also available on the country’s rank on the 2005 Human Development Index
taken from the Human Development Report of the UN, and their average life satisfaction
score for 2002 taken from the Eurobarometer Surveys.9 A lower rank on HDI is better, a
higher life satisfaction score is better. The propensity to migrate is even more highly
correlated with these two measures than it is with GDP per capita (Blanchflower et al,
2007).10
It is well-known that East Europeans are more likely to report that they are unhappy
(Blanchflower, 2001 and Blanchflower and Freeman, 1997). In a recent Candidate
Eurobarometer collected between September and October 2002 (ICPSR #4062),
respondents were asked the following question.
Q. On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all
satisfied with the life you lead?
A. Very satisfied=4; Fairly satisfied=3; Not very satisfied=2; Not at all satisfied=1

The correlation with the CPI is only -0.166, also drawn from the HDR 2006, Table 14.

The HDI is published annually by the United Nations and is a score that amalgamates three indicators:
lifespan; educational attainment and adjusted real income (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2005).
10

The correlation with the 2002 life satisfaction score is -0.75 which is similar to the 2001 score (-0.72),
but lower in 2003 (-0.55), 2004 (-0.57) and 2005 (-0.58), see Blanchflower et al (2007).

The scores by country were as follows: Bulgaria=2.02; Czech Republic=2.82;
Estonia=2.55; Hungary=2.60; Latvia=2.46; Lithuania=2.44; Malta=3.00; Poland=2.69;
Romania=2.39; Slovakia=2.56; Slovenia=3.05 and Turkey=2.43.11 The means of the life
satisfaction score variable reported above correlate reasonably well for the A8 countries
with the propensity to migrate (r=-0.751) and considerably better than the unemployment
or employment rates (see Blanchflower et al, 2007 for more details).12
Interestingly there has been some improvement in the life satisfaction scores in a number
of these Eastern European countries since accession in 2004, particularly in the Czech
Republic; Hungary; Latvia, Lithuania and especially Slovakia. Mean scores using the
same four point scale as above taken from the Eurobarometers and reported in the World
Database on Happiness were as follows from 2001-2006, along with those, for
comparison, for the UK. The country rankings are very similar to those in the Candidate
Barometers.

The OECD (2006b) has recently projected that GDP will grow particularly rapidly in both
Poland and Slovakia over the next couple of years. The OECD projects a growth rate of
around 8% in Slovakia in 2007, and 5% in Poland, where, it suggests remittances from
migrants will sustain consumption. The other member of the OECD is Hungary, which is
projected to grow by just 2% in 2007. Rapid GDP growth in some A10 countries and
improvements in their unemployment rates might suggest a reduction in the flows of both
permanent migrants and especially temporary workers to the UK from the A10 countries in
the future.

In summary, the favourable macroeconomic climate (low unemployment) and high
standard of living in the UK (GDP per capita) are reasons why immigrants from the A10

Blanchflower (2001) found that in the mid 1990s support for the free market was especially high in
Poland, Romania and Lithuania. The proportion of respondents in East European Eurobarometers 7 and 8
for 1996 and 1997 who reported that "the free market is right for the country's future" compared to those
who said it was 'wrong' was as follows:- Albania 85%; Poland 77%; Croatia 74%; Romania 71%; Lithuania
65%; Bulgaria 64%; Estonia 63%; Georgia 57%; Hungary 55%; FYR Macedonia 52%; Latvia 50%;
Slovenia 50%; Belarus 48%; Slovakia 43%; Czech Republic 36%; Kazakhstan 36%; Ukraine 32%; Russia
29% and Armenia 27% (2001, Table X).

countries may have been attracted to the UK. Rapid GDP growth in some A10 countries
and improvements in their unemployment rates might suggest a reduction in the flows of
both permanent migrants and especially temporary workers to the UK from the A8
countries in the future. Anticipated and legally required changes in the immigration
policies of other EU member states that will allow greater access to migrants from the A8
may also lead flows to the UK to fall as other opportunities become available. However,
Pedersen et al (2004) studied migration flows into 27 OECD countries from 1990-2000
and found that network effects, measured as the coefficient of the stock of immigrants of
own national background already resident in a country, had a large positive impact on
immigration flows. This suggests that rather than dissipate, flows to the UK could
continue well into the future.
2) Size of flows from the A10
It is difficult to get an exact estimate of the size of the flows of individuals from the A8
and A2 countries to the UK since accession. Some estimates suggest that around 600,000
A8 workers have come to the UK, but other sources suggest many fewer. It is also
unclear what proportion of such workers are long-term migrants and what proportion are
here for a short time and have subsequently returned home, perhaps to return again in the
future. The scale and nature of this flow is an important question for policy makers
because it affects the labour market and the wider economy. It is therefore important to
try and understand and reconcile the differences between different data sources as far as
possible. Doing this, we find that 600,000 workers is an upper bound for the stock of
post-accession A10 workers in the UK in mid-2007.
There are four main sources of data on the flow of A8 individuals: the Worker
Registration Scheme (WRS), National Insurance Number applications (NINos), Total
International Migration (TIM) data, and the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS).13 In
addition there is some early data on the flows from Bulgaria and Romania in 2007Q1.
We look at each of these briefly in turn.
1) Worker Registration Scheme (WRS)
Table 4 reports the number of employees, by A8 country, that registered on the WRS and
that were approved for work. The self-employed and workers from Romania and
Bulgaria do not need to register under the WRS. The largest number in every year has
come from Poland. The flows by quarter are very similar. The WRS suggests that
605,375 A8 employees had registered to work in the UK since accession – a further 4,415
were refused, 1,295 were exempt and 18,360 applications were withdrawn making a
grand total of 630,255 applicants. The three main countries from which migrants have
come are Poland (65%); Lithuania (10%); and Slovakia (10%). There have been little
obvious signs of slowing of the flows. For example in 2006Q1, 46,765 applications were
approved, compared with 46,820 in 2007Q1.
Table 5 reports data from the WRS that suggest that 55% of A8 migrants registering in
the twelve months to March 2007 only intended to stay in the UK for up to three months.
Actions appear to mirror intentions.

13

For further details of these surveys see Blanchflower, Saleheen and Shadforth (2007).

6

2) National Insurance Numbers (NINos)
Both employed and self-employed workers from the A8 and A2 nations need to register
for a National Insurance number to work legally in the UK. Table 6 shows that between
March 2004 and May 2007, some 623,575 A8 nationals registered for a UK National
Insurance number. This estimate is slightly larger than the number recorded on the
Worker Registration Scheme, with the difference probably reflecting self-employment.
At the time of writing numbers for the A2 were not available.
3) Labour Force Survey (LFS)
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a continuous household survey that provides a wide
range of data on labour market statistics and related topics such as training, qualifications,
income and disability. The LFS has been running in its present form since the spring of
1992 although an LFS has been carried out in Great Britain since 1973.
It is feasible to obtain estimates of the number of A10 migrants resident in the UK using
population weighted LFS micro-data. To the extent that these population weights
undercount the number of migrants then this would be a source of bias (Saleheen &
Shadforth, 2007).
We define an A10 worker based on country of birth; it is possible to use country of
origin, but the results are the same. Column 1 of Table 7 reports the numbers of A8
nationals present in the UK in Q1 (January, February, March) each year since 2003. The
LFS data indicate that around 435,000 nationals from the A8 countries were resident in
the UK by 2007Q1, of whom 330,000 had arrived since 2004; three-quarters are workers.
Over time the proportion of A8 migrants who are employees has risen and the selfemployment rate fallen.
4) Total International Migration, predominantly from the International Passenger Survey
The International Passenger Survey (IPS) is a voluntary survey of individuals passing
through the main UK air and sea ports and the Channel Tunnel. The IPS questions
250,000 passengers annually of whom only 1% is migrants. The data suggest that there
was a net positive migration flow of 223,000 in 2004 and a further 185,000 in 2005,
making a total of 408,000. As part of these, the IPS suggests that 132,000 individuals
have come to the UK from the A8 countries, which is a considerably lower number than
the other estimates.
The numbers from the A10 entering the UK since accession appears somewhat uncertain
given the available data. The WRS and NINo data give numbers several times greater
than the TIM data. But the sources vary in their coverage, both in terms of the numbers
captured (including definitional differences) and the period of observation. Table 8
attempts to accommodate the latter issue, adjusting the TIM (IPS) numbers such that they
– like the WRS, NINo and LFS data – also cover the period since Accession. Following
adjustment, it is apparent that the LFS and TIM (IPS) data now suggest similar numbers
have come to the UK from the A8, but the estimates remain much lower than the WRS or
NINo results. The remaining differences between the data sources reflect the groups of
individuals covered and definitions employed. The LFS and TIM data are designed to
capture only those who stay in the country for an extended period of time – more than 6
months for the LFS and 12 months for the IPS. In contrast, the NINo and WRS capture
7

all those who have come to the UK, including those that might return home relatively
quickly – or in some sense commute to the UK for work.
The broader ordering of the estimates also makes sense. The LFS micro-data suggest that
about 40,000 self-employed workers have come to the UK since Accession. This broadly
equates to the gap between the number of NINo applications, which covers all workers,
and the number of WRS applicants, which are solely employees. In addition, we should
also expect the estimated number from the A8 in the LFS to exceed the estimate from the
TIM (IPS), because the TIM (IPS) employs a more restrictive definition of a migrant –
being someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for a period of at least
a year.
Having reconciled the differences as far as possible, it appears that 600,000 workers is
likely to be an upper estimate of the number of people from the A8 who could potentially
be in the UK in early 2007. The data also suggest that as many as half of the individuals
that have come to the UK have not stayed permanently (see Table 5 above). There is
another source of data on international migration that supports our findings. Population
data recently available from Eurostat (2006) suggest that there was no substantial decline
in the populations of any of the A8 countries, especially Poland, between 2004 and 2005.
As a proportion of the population, the greatest net outflows have been from Lithuania (0.60%) and Latvia (-0.55%). This is consistent with the flows to the UK from the A8
being largely temporary in nature.
5) Flows from Bulgaria and Romania
At the time of writing (August, 2007), provisional data are available on the numbers of
workers who have moved to the UK from Bulgaria and Romania during the first quarter
of 2007 (Source: Bulgarian and Romanian Accession Statistics, January-March 2007,
Border and Immigration Agency, Home Office).14 The numbers are quite small to this
point. The statistics show that 10,345 A2 nationals have been granted access to the UK
labour market since accession. Of these, 815 were granted an Accession Worker Card15
(290 Bulgarians and 525 Romanians) and 7,105 individuals (2,505 and 4,590) were
approved a registration certificate entitling them to enter the UK for a purpose other than
paid employment.16 The number applying for a registration certificate may be
misleading however, as exempt17 workers are not obliged to apply for exemption – the
14

15

These include applications for work permits or applications for work authorisation in the Sectors Based
Scheme for low skilled. Family members wishing to join those previously granted an Accession Worker
Card (AWC) is also required to apply for an AWC.

16

The category also includes those that are exempt from the employment restrictions, those in the Highly
Skilled Migrants Programme, students, the self-employed, the self-sufficient and family members.

17

An A2 national is entitled to seek an exemption following 12 months lawful employment in the United
Kingdom, through marriage or civil partnership with a UK national, as the family member of an EEA
national (other than an A2 national who does not have unconditional access to the UK labour market) or by
meeting qualifying criteria of the Highly Skilled Migrants Programme, the Science and Engineering
Graduates Scheme or the Scottish Graduates Scheme, SEGS.

8

data therefore only reflect those that have chosen to do so. The largest proportion (40%)
of registration certificates were issued to self-employed workers, while a further 30%
went to individuals exempt from the employment restrictions. The remaining 2,425
workers (1,535/890) received clearance to work as part of the Seasonal Agricultural
Workers Scheme.
The most significant sectors of employment for those granted Accession Worker Cards
were the Entertainment and Leisure Services sector (principally as circus artistes),
followed by Hospitality and Catering and Health and Medical Services. In terms of
geographical settlement, 21% of workers were employed in the North East of England
and 17% in London. Wales received the fewest workers. Of those that applied in
2007Q1, 50% were aged 25-34 and just over half (53%) were male.
Given the fact that the workers from Eastern Europe generally intend, and actually do,
stay in the UK for relatively short spells, or as in the case of some from Bulgaria or
Romania who are only allowed to stay for six months, in our view it is inappropriate to
call them migrants, whereas they should more appropriately be considered temporary or
guest workers. One definition of guest workers, listed on Wikipedia, states that they are:
“persons who typically travel (either legally or illegally) to a country with much more
preferred job prospects than the one in which they currently reside. These workers
temporarily reside in the country in which they work and will often send most or all
wages earned, back to their country of origin (usually to a family).”
LaLonde and Topel (1997) found that 4.8 million of the 15.7 million US immigrants who
arrived between 1907 and 1957 had departed by the latter year. Chiswick and Hatton
(2003) pointed out that return migration exceeded immigration to the United States
during the 1930s. Yang (2006) recently examined the economics of return migration for
temporary labour migration by Filipinos. Yang found that, on average, a 10%
improvement in the exchange rate reduced the 12-month migrant return rate by 1.4
percentage points. This is a large effect, amounting to nearly one-fifth of the mean 12month return rate in his sample.
In private communication Barry Chiswick has pointed out to us that most migration
streams start with the early migrants expressing a desire to return, and many do return. As
family members join them, as they acquire destination-specific human capital, including
labor market information, as they lose origin-specific human capital through depreciation,
and as a larger ethnic community gets established, The return migration propensity
declines. These A10 workers, Chiswick argues, may say they are temporary and act that
way now, and they may even seriously believe that they are temporary, but they will
increasingly become permanent if history has anything to offer.
Constant and Zimmermann (2007) examine return or what they call ‘circular’ migration
and argue that it is potentially a way to minimise psychological costs due to long
separations from family members. Using evidence on the guestworker population in the
German Socio-Economic Panel they found that more than 60% were repeat migrants.
“Migrants from European Union member countries, those not owning a
dwelling in Germany, the younger and the older (excluding the middle ages)
9

were found to be significantly more likely to engage in repeat migration and
to stay out of Germany longer. Males and those emigrants with a German
passport exit more frequently, while those with more education exit
less…Males do not differ from females with respect to their total years
away from the host country…Migrants with family in the home country
remain out longer” (Constant and Zimmermann, 2007, p.4).
Christian Dustmann, in a number of papers, has undertaken the most complete analysis in
the UK of the economics of return migration. Dustmann (1994), for example, suggests
three potential motives for return migration 1) the migrant prefers consumption in the
home country, 2) if prices are lower in the home country than in the host country this
allows the entrant to take advantage of high wages abroad and low prices at home 3)
human capital acquired in the host country is more valuable in the home country.
Dustmann (1996) found that return propensities in Europe increase with age and decrease
with the number of years of residence.
Recently, Dustmann and Weiss (2007) have shown that return migration in the UK is not
a new phenomenon. They explored this issue empirically before the influx from Eastern
Europe using data from the LFS from 1992-2004. The authors found that, taking the
population of immigrants who were still in the country one year after arrival as the base,
about 40 per cent of all males and 55 per cent of all females had left Britain five years
later. Their data suggests that return migration is particularly pronounced for the group
of immigrants from the EU, the Americas and Australia/New Zealand; it was much less
pronounced for immigrants from the Indian Sub-Continent and from Africa.
Distinguishing between white and non-white immigrants, they found that white
immigrants had substantially higher return propensities than non-white immigrants.
Consequently, Dustmann and Weiss found, using data prior to the accession of the A10 in
2004, that immigrants still in the UK after ten years are different in terms of age and
education than the sample of immigrants after one year. As we will show below it
appears that the return rate for workers from the A10 is even more rapid than for those
who have arrived in the UK from other countries.
3) Characteristics of the new arrivals from Eastern Europe
It is possible to use the various data sources described above to determine the
characteristics of new (defined here as post-2004, and used interchangeably with ‘recent’)
A8 migrants and how they compare with new migrants from non-A8 countries, migrants
who arrived pre-2004, as well as the non-migrant population or natives. The main
characteristics of the new workers from the A8 are as follows.
1) Region
Table 9 shows the total number of worker applications from the WRS (column 1) that
were approved by region and in column 2 the proportion while column 3 gives the
number of applications for National Insurance Numbers, column 4 gives the relevant
percentages alongside the distribution of the 16+ population in column 5. It is apparent
WRS approvals have been especially high in the East of England. The proportion
applying through London employers has decreased over time from 15% in 2005Q1 to
11% in 2007Q1. The proportion of NINo applications made in London is particularly
high suggesting that this is the first port of call for many of the A10.
10

2) Industry
Polish workers make up the largest proportion in every sector, which is perhaps not
surprising given that 65% of workers registered with the WRS are Polish.18 The most
important industries are Administration, Business and Management; Hospitality and
Catering and Agriculture. A greater proportion of Latvians (24%) and Lithuanians (20%)
worked in Agriculture compared with any other nationality (10%). The majority of
workers in the Administration, Business & Management occupation group work for
recruitment agencies and could be employed in a variety of occupations, and on a
temporary basis. In 2004 (May-December), 24.8% of registered workers were in this
category, compared with 31.9% by end 2005, and 36.7% by end 2006, and 37.0% in
2007Q1. Non-A8 migrants are more likely to be employed in the public sector –
especially as nurses and carers - confirmed by work permits data.
3) Occupations
The dominant occupations are less skilled. The largest occupation is Process Operative
(26%) followed by warehouse operative and packer (8%). Out of a total of 566,545
workers who registered between July 2004 and March 2007 the eleven occupations with
more than ten thousand workers were as follows:
Process operative
Warehouse operative
Packer
Cleaner, domestic staff
Farm Worker
Waiter, waitress
Maid, room attendant
Care Assistants and Home Care
Labourer, building
Sales and retail assistants

There appears to be a small, but apparently growing, number of workers in professional
and technical occupations. These include the following eighteen highly skilled
occupations that account for just over 6,500 workers (Source: Accession Monitoring
Report, May 2004-March 2007, Annex A).

In addition 65.6% of applications for NINos have been from Poles, 10.1% from Lithuanians and 9.7%
from Slovakians.

4) Temporary vs. full-time working and earnings
Approximately 50% of A8 workers hold temporary jobs, but the proportions vary a lot
between sectors; in Agriculture 70% of jobs were temporary, while in hospitality and
catering the pattern was reversed with only 20% in temporary employment. In
Administration, Business and Management 82% were in temporary employment. Overall,
97% were working full-time and the majority (77%) were earning between ₤4.50 and
₤9.99 per hour.
5) Household type
It is apparent from the Labour Force Surveys that the household composition for those
individuals who have come to the UK from the A10 is quite different from that of natives
or immigrants from elsewhere. We examined weighted responses in the most recent
surveys for January 2006-March 2007 in the LFS to the household composition variable
HLDCMP. The distribution for natives, those from the A10 and from the non-A10 was
as follows:
1 male over pensionable age with no children
1 female over pensionable age with no children
1 adult under pensionable age with no children
1 adult with one child
1 adult with two or more children
Married couple both under pensionable age with no children
Cohabiting couple both under pensionable age with no children
Married couple one or more over pensionable age with no children
Cohabiting couple one or more over pensionable age with no children
Married couple with one child
Married couple with 2 children
Married couple with 3 or more children
Cohabiting couple with one child
Cohabiting couple with 2 children
Cohabiting couple with 3 or more children
2 adults, not married or cohabiting, both under pensionable age with no children
2 adults, not married or cohabiting, one or more over pensionable age with no children
2 adults, not married or cohabiting with 1 or more children
3 or more adults with no children including at least one married/cohabiting couple
3 or more adults with 1 or 2 children including at least one married/cohabiting couple
3 or more adults with >=3 children including at least one married/cohabiting couple
3 or more adults with no children

It is apparent that those from the A10 were much more likely to be in households with at
least three adults than is the case for either natives or those from the non-A10 (47.7%,
24.3% and 27.6% respectively). It thus appears that the A10 are particularly likely to be
sharing quarters and not living with a spouse. Temporary migrants are presumably
willing to live in poor conditions in high rent areas such as London whereas natives and
even permanent migrants may be less prepared to do so. This may then help to ease
worker shortages in the London area, for example, where rents are so high as to dissuade
natives who aren't making City wages.19
6) Age and gender
The proportion of workers who register on the WRS who are young is particularly high
and has changed little over time. Of those who applied between May 2004 and March
2007, 83% were aged 18-34 and 44% were aged 18-24. The male: female ratio was
57:43. Only 7% of registered workers who applied between May 2004 and March 2007
declared that they had dependants living with them in the UK. Amongst those who did
have dependants with them the average number of dependants was 1.5. In the LFS recent
A8 migrants are also found to be young, educated, and disproportionately male (Saleheen
and Shadforth, 2006).
These data fit with other information available from a Candidate Eurobarometer Survey
conducted by the European Commission in April 2001, which considered the migration
intentions of the A8 plus Cyprus and Malta residents well before the borders opened in
May 2004. Respondents in these countries, plus Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, were
asked “do you intend to go and live and work – for a few months or several years – in a
current EU country in the next five years?.”20 Obviously, one cannot assume that
everyone who expresses an interest in migration will actually move, but it turns out that
there are patterns in the data consistent with the actual flows to the UK. Table 10 reports
the results of estimating the probability of an individual responding in the affirmative to
the above question using a dprobit.21 Column 1 includes controls for age, gender,
schooling, labour market status and marital status and country dummies, with the
excluded country being Malta. Probabilities of ‘intending to move’ were especially high
in Lithuania and Poland, which, as we noted above, have been the two main source
countries of A8 workers to the UK. Column 1 suggests that intentions to move were
higher for men, the young, the most educated, unmarried or divorced, the unemployed,
students and professionals.
Respondents in the survey were also asked “how willing would you be to live in another
European country where the language is different from your mother tongue?” Possible

The dprobit procedure in STATA fits maximum-likelihood probit models and is an alternative to probit.
Rather than reporting the coefficients, dprobit reports the marginal effect, that is the change in the
probability for an infinitesimal change in each independent, continuous variable and, by default, reports the
discrete change in the probability for dummy variables.

13

answers were ‘not at all; not much; to some extent; very much’. Column 2 reports the
results of estimating an ordered logit where the dependent variable is set to one if not at
all, 2=not much etc. with the same controls as in column 1. The patterns revealed in
column 2 are very similar to those in column 1 – the probability of being willing to move
is higher among the young; men; the unmarried and divorced; the most educated;
professionals and business proprietors; those from Latvia and Poland, but also now
Slovakia. These equations seem highly consistent with the characteristics of the migrants
outlined above – intentions appear to be highly correlated with subsequent actions.
Interestingly, the World Bank (2007) addressed the issue of the mobility of the young in
its recent World Development Report. They found that the propensity to migrate
increases over the teenage years peaking in the early twenties in many destination
countries, such as Spain and the United States. Hence, young people make up a higher
proportion of the flow of international migrants than the stock. Young people are likely to
face lower costs of moving and have higher lifetime returns. The World Bank notes that
when the only legal options for the young are through high-skilled immigration,
categories requiring tertiary education or substantial job experience, migrants are less
likely to be young.
The World Bank also conducted a survey of youths aged 15-24 in seven developing
countries (Albania, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Iraq, Malaysia, Romania and Tajikistan) and
asked “if it were possible for you legally to move to another country to work would you?”
Results are presented in Table 11.22 Very high proportions of young people in the World
Bank survey said they would like to move, especially in Romania and Albania, but the
vast majority of those who wanted to move expressed a desire to move for only a short
period allowing them to save money to buy a house, open a business, or achieve other
goals in their home countries (World Bank (2007) chapter 8 figure 8.5).23 A high
proportion of such moves would not then conform to the UN recommended definition of
a migrant as an individual who changes their country of residence for at least one year.
3a) Propensity to work, self-employment and wages
There is little or no evidence to suggest that that the new A10 workers have come to the
UK to claim or receive benefits: they have come to work.24 A8 workers, who are
registered under the WRS, have a right to reside and are entitled to in-work benefits such
as housing benefit and council tax benefit. If they are in part-time work of less than 15
hours per week they can qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance. If they lose their job they
lose their worker status, but are able to remain in the UK to find another job. However,
they do not have complete access to the benefit system, although after 12 months of
22

We thank David McKenzie at the World Bank for providing us with these data.

23

In both Romania and Albania over 90% of males expressed a desire to move, but only around 20% of the
total said they wanted to move permanently.

24

Similar conclusions on the impact of the A10 arrivals were drawn by Wadensjö (2007) in the case of
Sweden and Hughes (2007) for Ireland. Note that Ireland operated the same benefit rules as those
implemented in the UK because of a Common Travel Area, which necessitates operating similar
arrangements in relation to immigration.

14

continuous employment they can have access to the full range of benefits. Once someone
has been working for 12 months they can apply for a residence permit.
By 2007Q1, only 744/4,337 applications for income support have been approved;
1,858/8,500 applications for income based Jobseeker’s Allowance were approved; 46/193
applications for state pension credit, and 1,992 applications for homelessness assistance
had been allowed to proceed. 25 30,749/46,938 applications for tax credit have been
approved. There have only been 235 local authority lettings to A8 workers in England.
As Hillier and Hayes note:
"(I)t is unlikely that large numbers of A8 citizens will uproot themselves
from their homes, come to the UK to work for at least a year in order to
secure a future life of state-funded living. First, there is the effort involved
in this, and we are presumably talking about people who are not prepared to
make much effort on most fronts. Second, there is the standard of living
involved. Would life on state benefits in the UK really be that much better
than life on a low income in Estonia? Well, it might be. But probably not
by enough to make it a worthwhile option for an otherwise idle person if
they had to work for at least a year – perhaps working on a farm on
minimum wages – to get it" (2006, p.13).
As we show below, the influx of workers from the A8 appears to have had little or no
discernible effect on the unemployment rate or any other labour market aggregate for that
matter. It is plausible of course, that an influx of immigrants could displace natives or
less recent immigrants, and this is an issue we discuss further below. The large literature
on the issue suggests that this is unlikely to have been very important.
We now move on to examine data from the LFS on the extent to which A10 entrants to
the UK differ from natives and migrants from elsewhere. To do this, we examine the
probability that they work, the so-called employment to population ratio (EPOP); their
wages and, conditional on working, whether they are self-employed. We find that those
from the A10 have high probabilities of working and being self-employed, and receive
relatively low wages.
a) Work
We investigate the propensity to work of the new arrivals from the A10 in Table 12.
Here the dependent variable is set to one if the respondent to the Labour Force Survey
said they were working, either as an employee or self-employed, zero otherwise,
including being unemployed or out of the labour force (OLF). The sample is restricted to
those aged 16-70 and excludes students.26 In column 1 we include only two controls, one
identifying whether the individual's country of origin was in the A10 or from the non25

Office.

suggested that in his work with John Schmitt they find that the results are sensitive to their inclusion.

A10 along with three year dummies. The A10 variable is significantly positive while the
non-A10 is negative, suggesting those from the A10 have a higher propensity to work
than either the indigenous population or those who were born outside the A10. Column 2
includes an additional control if the respondent arrived in the UK in 2004-2007, which
enters insignificantly. The next column replaces the recent arrival variable with two
separate controls distinguishing recent arrivals from the A10 from recent arrivals from
the non-A10 alongside controls for age, gender, race, then schooling and region of
residence – the results are broadly similar in each case. It is apparent that the signs on the
variables are opposite for the A10 and non-A10 variables. Individuals from the A10 are
more likely to be working than the native population, and especially so for those who
arrived recently. This is in direct contrast to the non-A10 immigrants who are less likely
to be working than the native population; the probability of working is especially low for
recent immigrants from outside the A10. This is consistent with the OECD's (2006a, p.
51) more general finding that the participation rate of immigrants is on the whole lower
than that of the native population. Results are similar in column 4 when region of
residence controls are added. If we look at column 4, those from the A10 who arrived in
the UK since 2004 have nearly a fourteen percentage point higher probability of working
than native workers while recent immigrants from the non-A10 have a four percentage
point lower probability of working than is true of natives. In columns 5 and 6 of Table 12
we add five race dummies, with and without region of residence dummies respectively.
Adding these dummies confounds some of the non-A10 immigrant effects, but noticeably
has little or no effect, as would be expected, on the A10 results.
b) Wages
There is also evidence to suggest that these Eastern European workers in general and
recent arrivals in particular, are being paid relatively low wages, ceteris paribus. Data are
available on this in the Labour Force Surveys. Table 13 reports the results of estimating
six log hourly wage equations using data from the 2004-2007 LFS. They follow the same
structure as in Blanchflower and Oswald (1994a, 1994b). Sample sizes are smaller than
in Table 12 as the sample is restricted to employees only and restricted further because
wages are only asked in wave 1 and wave 5 of the survey.27 In total then there are
approximately one hundred and fifty-five thousand observations. Each equation includes
a set of year dummies and age and its square and gender; schooling controls are added in
column 2; region of residence in column 3; and industry dummies in column 4. In
columns 5 and 6 region of residence dummies are replaced with region of work controls.
Column 6 also includes controls for race.
Adding controls has an impact – some of the difference in wages across groups depends
on characteristics, particularly schooling, region and industry, with region, whether
measured by residence or place of work, being particularly important. It is apparent that
recent arrivals from the A10 have particularly low wages, ceteris paribus. For example,
in column 5 which includes age, gender, schooling, region of work and industry
dummies, A10 workers receive 5.6% lower wages than natives. The wages for the A10
who arrived since 2004 are 8.6% lower still - obtained by taking anti-logarithms and

deducting one. Interestingly non-A10 migrants have significantly higher wages (+3.5%)
than natives no matter when they arrived, holding constant their characteristics, including
race (column 6).28 The OECD (2006a, p.222) reports that one of the main features of
labour immigration into the United Kingdom prior to the influx of workers from the A10
was the high proportion accounted for by corporate transfers. The OECD noted that in
2005 a quarter of the interviewees working abroad a year before and in the United
Kingdom at the time of the interview were working for the same employer. This may, in
part, help to explain the higher earnings of the non-A10 workers.
c) Self-employment
In almost all countries for which data are available, OECD (2006a) found that selfemployment among immigrants has increased over the past few years, both in numbers
and as a percentage of overall self-employment. The share of foreign-born in total selfemployment reported by the OECD was as follows (%).

In some countries, the OECD found that the increase has been particularly apparent.
Foreign-born persons accounted in 2004 for some 11% of total self-employment in
France and the United Kingdom, 12% in Belgium and nearly 14% in Sweden, figures
which are generally higher than the share of immigrants in the total labour force.
It is appropriate then to examine the incidence of (self-reported) self-employment among
A8 migrants given that the self-employed do not have to register under the WRS,
although they do have to apply for a NINo, unless they work illegally in the black
economy and are paid cash in hand. Table 14 once again uses the LFS data file for 20042007Q1 to estimate a dprobit, but here the sample is restricted to workers, with the
dependent variable set to one if self-employed and zero if a worker. The question on
labour market status is asked in all five waves so the sample size is around six hundred

Drinkwater et al (2006) found from an analysis of wages in the Labour Force Surveys of 2001-2006, that
Poles had lower rates of return to their human capital than other recent migrants, even after controlling for
other personal and job-related characteristics.

and thirty thousand. The results are standard, in that the probability of being selfemployed is higher for men, Asians and Chinese, rises with age and is especially high for
those with a trade.29 It is low for blacks and the young and for those with an HND,
teaching or nursing ('other') qualification only.
Foreign workers have a higher probability of being self-employed; those from the A10
have a particularly high probability (column 1), but recent immigrants have lower
probabilities (column 2). As we move to the right additional controls are added. Column
3 adds age, gender, race and schooling controls. Column 4 adds region of residence
dummies. Column 5 replaces the region of residence dummies with controls for region of
work. Column 6 separates out recent A10 workers from recent non-A10. It is apparent
that the A10 have a particularly high propensity to be self-employed, although this is
lower for those who arrived recently. One possibility is that many of the self-employed
from the A10 are not being captured by the LFS as they are only in the UK for short
spells.
Interestingly, several recent Flash Eurobarometers have been carried out for a number of
countries on behalf of the European Commission, over the period 2000-2004, on the topic
of Entrepreneurship.30 The list of countries includes the 25 members of the EU including
the A8 plus the USA, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. Workers in these countries
were asked if “it is difficult to start one’s own business due to a lack of financial
support?” Table 15 ranks countries according to their answers to this question based on
the proportion saying they ‘strongly agreed’ (n=32,606). Column 2 is the proportion who
strongly agreed that “it is difficult to start one’s own business due to the complex
administrative procedures?”31 Respondents in these countries were also asked “suppose
you could choose between different kinds of jobs. Which one would you prefer – being
an employee or being self-employed?”32 Column 3 tabulates the proportion saying they
would like to be self-employed. It is apparent from the Table that there is a desire for
self-employment in the A10 countries as well as a perceived lack of financial support
alongside complex administrative procedures that make it hard to set up in business.
It is well known in the literature that capital constraints have a major impact on the ability
to become and remain self-employed (Blanchflower and Oswald (1998; Blanchflower,
2000, 2004, Blanchflower and Shadforth, 2007). These factors will likely contribute to a
desire to come to the UK, where these circumstances may appear less prevalent. Over the
last couple of years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of self-employed.
For example, over the period Dec/Feb 2005-2007 the number of self-employed increased

In both of the questions used in columns 1 and 2 possible responses were: strongly agree, agree, disagree,

by 187,000, representing 64.0% of the total growth of employment of 292,000 (Source:
Labour Market Statistics First Release, ONS April 2007). In part this increase is likely
attributable to the influx of self-employed workers – particularly Polish plumbers and
construction workers - from Eastern Europe who don’t have to register on the WRS.
Hence, the growth is self-employment reported above is likely to be an under-estimate of
the true number of self-employed from Eastern Europe, especially for those who are in
the UK for short spells.
In summary, the new arrivals from Eastern Europe who have come to work in the UK
tend to be young, male, educated and unmarried. Approximately one third work for
recruitment agencies. They disproportionately work in East Anglia and the West and East
Midlands. Holding constant a variety of characteristics including age, qualifications and
location, A10 workers have higher self-employment rates, lower wages and have higher
employment to population ratios than natives. In contrast, recent non-A10 migrants have
comparable wages and lower self-employment rates than natives. A10 workers who
arrived before 2004 have higher self-employment rates, but lower wage rates than
natives.
4) The fear of unemployment
Increasing numbers of migrants to the UK may well have increased the ‘fear’ of
unemployment, which tends to have a downward impact on pay especially in the nonunion sector (Blanchflower, 1991). As part of the 2005 European Working Conditions
Survey, workers were asked (Q37a) 'How much do you agree or disagree with the
following statements describing some aspects of your job? - I might lose my job in the
next 6 months – Strongly agree; Agree; Neither agree nor disagree; Disagree; Strongly
disagree?'.33 Across all 32 countries asked, 14.1% of workers agreed or strongly agreed
that they might lose their job in the next six months. The proportions were particularly
high in Eastern Europe, but low in Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and the UK.34, 35 In
the US General Social Survey workers are asked how likely it is that they will lose their
job or be laid-off in the next 12 months and, on average across the 2002, 2004 and 2006
surveys 11.2% answered 'very likely' or 'quite likely' (variable joblose). The fear of
unemployment appears widespread.
33

The survey was conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working
Conditions. For details of the survey see 'Quality Report of the 4th European Working Conditions Survey',
2007. See www.eurofound.europe.eu
34

The proportion answering that they agreed or strongly agreed by country was as follows - Austria 9%;
Belgium 9%; Cyprus 14%; Czech Republic 33%; Germany 13%; Denmark 7%; Estonia 19%; Spain 15%;
Finland 13%; France 8%; Greece 21%; Hungary 22%; Ireland 10%; Italy 9%; Lithuania 23%; Luxembourg
6%; Latvia 19%; Netherlands 18%; Malta 15%; Poland 27%; Portugal 19%; Sweden 20%; Slovenia 27%;
Slovakia 15%; United Kingdom 7%; Norway 7%; Switzerland 12%; Bulgaria 23%; Croatia 19%; Romania
18% and Turkey 19%.
35

The same question was also asked in the 2003 European Quality of Life Survey. The proportion
answering that they aggress or strongly agreed by country was as follows: Austria 5%; Belgium 7%;
Bulgaria 5%; Cyprus 13%; Czech Republic 16%; Denmark 9%; Estonia 21%; Finland 8%; France 10%;
Germany 7%; Greece 12%; Hungary 9%; Ireland 6%; Italy 7%; Latvia 30%; Lithuania 32%; Luxembourg
8%; Malta 8%; Netherlands 3%; Poland 18%; Portugal 12%; Romania 18%; Slovakia 19%; Slovenia 9%;
Spain 10%; Sweden 9%; Turkey 28%; UK 7%; weighted total 11.3%. Own calculations.

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 16 model the responses to the above question across the
available countries using an ordered logit procedure. Column 1 includes controls for age,
gender, schooling, immigrant, type of contract, years of job tenure, private sector along
with country dummies. Column 2 adds 64 industry dummies. It is apparent from these
regressions that the fear of unemployment is higher the longer job tenure is, and is lower
for the more educated, for those on indefinite contracts, full-timers and those who work
in the public sector. In column 1 the fear of unemployment is significantly higher for
men, but the coefficient becomes insignificant in column 2 when industry dummies are
added. The fear of unemployment is highest in the East European countries and lowest in
Norway and France.
Columns 3 and 4 of Table 16 model the impact the fear of unemployment has on
earnings. Here the earnings variable is the country specific decile of the respondent's net
monthly income from their main paid job, which is coded 1-10. In each country, the
respondents were asked to indicate in which band their income lies. The respondents
were given a scale on which they could place themselves, because this tends to produce
higher response rates. The problem facing international surveys, however, is how to
make the scales meaningful in each country (by adapting them to the national pay levels)
but also comparable internationally. The European Foundation’s approach to this issue
was to ensure that the national 10-point scales roughly matched the real distribution of
earnings. Using Eurostat’s European Earnings Structure Survey, 2002, the earnings of
each EU country were divided into 10 bands and ranked from low to high. For instance,
the lowest 10% of wage earners in the UK received less than £1,310 in gross earnings per
month in 2002, the second 10% received between £1,310 and £1,549 per month, etc., up
to the highest 10% of wage earners, who earned more than £4,941 per month. This table
was then adjusted to indicate net, rather than gross, earnings, and the effects of inflation
from 2002 to 2005 were included. Finally, some figures were rounded (to make them
easier to read) and presented to the fieldwork institutes in each country for consultation.36
We model the dependent variable as the country specific decile in which the individual's
income falls. Results are similar if an ordered logit is used. Other possibilities would be
to include mid-points and close off the tails in some arbitrary way but this involves
making more assumptions than to simply model the deciles using Ordinary Least
Squares, which is what we do here. Controls are essentially the same as in columns 1 and
2 and are pretty much standard for wage equations; additional controls are added for days
and hours worked.
The results in columns 3 and 4 of Table 16 confirm the findings in Blanchflower (1991),
that the fear of unemployment lowers wages. In that paper it was shown that the
probability of job loss appears to have a powerful effect upon earnings. Workers who
stated that they expected to be made redundant did not receive a compensating
differential but were paid, on average, approximately 8% less, ceteris paribus. One
possibility is that bad workers have a relatively high fear of redundancy because of their
poor performance. However, Blanchflower (1991) argued that fear of unemployment
36

of the 4th European Working Conditions Survey', 2007 referred to above.

20

itself, and not poor worker quality, is the explanation for the significant coefficient on the
redundancy dummy. One possible way around this problem is to exploit the fact that
when plants close both good and bad workers lose their jobs. Thus, as a check the
'redundancy expected' variable for the UK was replaced with one relating to the
expectation of plant closure which also lowered pay by 8%. This seems to support the
idea that fear of unemployment is not primarily a proxy for worker quality.
Unfortunately in the data we use here we do not have information on the reason why
workers expect to lose their jobs in the next six months so the results are suggestive.
The coefficients on the four variables included to distinguish whether an individual
agrees that they are likely to lose their job rise with the level of agreement and, as might
be expected, are highest for those who agree strongly that this is likely to happen to them.
The effects appear to be large. We experimented with a set of interaction terms between
the immigrant dummy and the fear of unemployment variables using the specification in
column 4. The reason for doing so is that it is clear from columns 1 and 2 of the table
that given the positive coefficient on the immigrant dummy, that they have the most to
fear from recessions.37 These variables were always insignificant suggesting that fear of
unemployment changes perceptions among both natives and immigrants.38
A recent, monthly survey of consumers conducted by the European Union is also
consistent with the view that the fear of unemployment in the UK has risen and been
above its long run average since around 2005.39 The Directorate General for Economic
and Financial Affairs of the European Commission conducts regular harmonised surveys
for different sectors of European Union and applicant country economies. They are
addressed to representatives of the industry (manufacturing), the services, retail trade and
construction sectors, as well as to consumers. Consumers in each monthly survey are
asked (Q7): “How do you expect the number of people unemployed in this country to
change over the next twelve months? The number will a) increase sharply b) increase
slightly c) remain the same d) fall slightly e) fall sharply f) don’t know.” The answers
obtained from the survey are aggregated into a survey ‘balance’. Balances are
constructed as the difference between the proportion giving positive and negative replies.
The Commission calculates EU and euro-area averages on the basis of the national results
and seasonally adjusts the balance series.
Charts 1-3 plot three-month averages of the survey balances (advanced 12 months)
against the actual unemployment rate for the UK, EU-15 and Ireland respectively. Chart
1 shows that fear of unemployment and actual unemployment have risen over the past
few years in the UK. Chart 2 shows that the fear of unemployment has declined in the
EU-15 since 2003/4.40 Interestingly, the survey balances fell in Austria; Belgium;

unemployment than the native population or nationals", p.58.

We calculated the series for EU-15 weighted according to the population of each country for each year.
Due to the availability of the data, the EU-15 series for unemployment expectations includes:

21

Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Luxembourg; the Netherlands; Portugal and
Sweden since mid-2003. The main exceptions are the UK and Ireland, which
experienced increases and Greece, Italy and Spain where the series were essentially flat.
Among the A10 accession countries there was a decline in the survey balances of all but
Hungary, which saw an increase. Over the past twelve months only the UK (+0.2%),
Portugal (+0.2%), Luxembourg (+0.2%) and Hungary (+0.4%) have experienced
increases in unemployment. In contrast, unemployment fell by 1.0pp in the EU as a
whole, although it should be said that the EU has a higher level than the UK (7.0% and
5.4% respectively), (source: Table 19, Labour Market Statistics, First Release, July 2007,
ONS).
Chart 3 reports the survey balance and unemployment rate in Ireland, which is the only
other major country in the EU that has experienced a big increase in migration from the
A10. Ireland’s population increased by 313,000, or 8.1%, between 2002 and 2006. Of
this increase 213,000 was from migration. The largest increases were from Poland
(+60k); Lithuania (+22k) and +40k from the rest of the EU-25 excluding Britain and
Northern Ireland.41 According to the 2006 Census (Table 29A) 129,000 people whose
birthplace was in Eastern Europe were living in the Irish Republic.42 These numbers are
dramatically higher than they were in the 2002 Irish Census, when there were only
approximately 2,000 Poles and Lithuanians living in Ireland.
Interestingly, the fear of unemployment in Ireland rose, as it did in the UK as the number
of East Europeans in the country increased since 2002, even though there has been no
change in unemployment in Ireland. ILO unemployment has remained steady in Ireland
at 4.4% since 2002.43 Consistent with a rise in the fear of unemployment, average
earnings growth has fallen since 2003 from 6.4% to 3.1%. The data below are average
weekly earnings in Euros for Ireland and cover all industries and relate to employees in
firms with 10 or more persons.44

Swedish unemployment has been relatively tight recently and the Swedish government
has been concerned about skill shortages and so opened its borders to workers from
Eastern Europe (Wadensjö, 2007). In contrast with the UK and Ireland, the fear of
unemployment as measured by the survey balances in the European Commission's
harmonised surveys for Sweden actually declined since mid-2003. It does appear that the
scale of the flows have been relatively small though. According to Statistics Sweden the
numbers of immigrants in 2004 was 62,028; in 2005, 65,229; and in 2006, 95,750,
compared with 36,586, 38,118 and 44,908 emigrants respectively.45 The number of
immigrants in the first half of 2007 was significantly higher than it was in the first half of
2006 (46,970 and 45,649 respectively). The decline in the fear of unemployment
accompanied a fairly substantial decline in actual unemployment. Swedish ILO
unemployment for June 2007 for those aged 16 -64 was 4.9%, down from 6.3% a year
earlier. As unemployment fell so did respondent's perceptions of what was going to
happen to the number of unemployed in the following twelve months.
5) The macro-economic policy consequences of A10 migration
The overall impact of immigration on native labour market outcomes, inflation and
growth on its own is not clear-cut – there is no automatic rule-of-thumb that we can look
to in order to determine the impact on the economy. Dustman et al (2005) examined the
way immigration impacted native outcomes in the UK using data from the 1983-2000
Labour Force Surveys. They used pooled data for eighteen years across seventeen
regions (n=306) but, because of data availability, just the period 1992-2000 for wages.
They estimated a series of regressions with the immigrant-native ratio as a control. Their
main findings were that there was little evidence of any adverse outcomes for natives on
wages, employment or unemployment, consistent with findings for the US and elsewhere.
If there was evidence of any adverse outcomes it was limited to those with intermediate
levels of education. An increase in immigration, amounting to one per cent of the native
population in their preferred IV specification, would lead to a decrease of 0.07 percentage
points in the native employment rate, but this was not significant at conventional levels.46
45

46

IV is necessary because immigrant shares and immigrant outcomes may be spatially correlated because
of common fixed influences.

23

Furthermore, the authors found no evidence of any significant effects on wages,
unemployment or participation using their IV specification.
Hatton and Tani (2005) have investigated the hypothesis that net immigration is a
determinant of inter-regional migration flows for Britain. The evidence indicates
consistently negative correlations between immigration to one region from abroad and inmigration from other regions. But they are only significant for the southern regions where
immigration of foreign citizens is most concentrated. Nevertheless they suggest that interregional migration may be an important mechanism through which the British labour
market adjusts to immigration. Their results are also consistent with the modest wage and
employment effects of immigration at the local level. Frijters et al. (2005) find that
immigrant job search is less successful than that of natives; immigrants are as likely to
gain employment through informal methods as via verifiable routes; the probability of
success increases with years since migration. The finding that immigrants do not
effectively compete for jobs may thus help explain why immigration has little impact on
native employment. Manacorda et al (2007) find evidence that natives and immigrants in
the UK are imperfect substitutes, like Ottaviano and Peri (2005, 2006) for the US. They
show that an increase in immigration primarily reduces the wages of immigrants relative
to natives with little discernable effect on the wages of the native-born. Manacorda et al
find no effect on the employment of either natives or previous migrants, consistent with
the view that the elasticity of aggregate labour supply is close to zero in the UK. This
acts to attenuate any effect of increased labour supply on the native wage distribution and
then only has a sizeable effect on wages of migrants who were already in the UK. It also
helps to explain the findings of Dustman et al (2005) and others that the wage impact of
immigration on natives is small.
Longhi et al. (2005) calculate that, across 165 estimates from nine recent studies for
various OECD countries, the average estimated impact on natives’ employment of a 1%
increase in the number of immigrants is stronger for low-skilled than for high-skilled
workers (-0.04% for low-skilled only), but on average it amounts to a negligible -0.02%.
The impact is larger on existing immigrants, but still small at only –0.05%.
In an interesting new study for the OECD, Jean and Jiménez (2007) also examined the
unemployment effect of immigration in OECD countries, with a focus on the time profile
of these effects and on their interaction with product and labour market policies. They did
not find any permanent effect of immigration, measured as the share of immigrants in the
labour force, upon natives’ unemployment. They did, however, find significant evidence
of a transitory and delayed impact on unemployment of changes in the share of
immigrants. The impact was weak when measured at the skill level: natives with skills
most similar to those of immigrants were not found to suffer from a strong rise in their
unemployment rate relative to other categories of natives. Jean and Jiménez (2007)
found further that the extent and duration of the unemployment impact of immigration
partly is shown to depend on policies. In particular, they found that anticompetitive
product market regulation increased both the magnitude and persistence of the impact of
a change in the share of immigrants in the labour force on native male unemployment.
They show that employment protection legislation increases the persistence of the
unemployment impact of immigration, while the generosity of unemployment benefits
24

increases its magnitude. These are particularly low in the UK compared with most other
OECD countries. The authors conclude as follows.
"Policies that enhance the adaptability of labour and product markets to
immigration shocks should help limit the impact of these shocks, while at
the same time helping the labour market to quickly revert to a new
equilibrium. In sum, immigration per se is not a problem for natives’
unemployment. However, changes in immigration flows may require
adjustments that are costly for the native population, and well-suited
framework policies can be important in minimising these costs."
(Jean and Jiménez, 2007, p.22)
In thinking about the supply potential of an economy, most people would probably agree
that extra (immigrant) workers in an economy would raise the supply potential of the
economy. But the extent to which aggregate supply increases will depend on the
economic characteristics of immigrants relative to native workers. A recent survey of
contacts of the Bank of England’s regional Agents suggested that the new A8 workers
were highly productive. This is consistent with the findings of a Home Office Study on
the use of migrant labour that concluded as follows.
“Employers cited advantages of migrant workers in terms of their general
attitude and work ethic. They tended to be more motivated, reliable and
committed than domestic workers. For example, migrants were said to be
more likely to: demonstrate lower turnover and absenteeism; be prepared
to work longer and flexible hours; be satisfied with their duties and hours
of work; and work harder in terms of productivity and speed. In the view
of some employers, the more favourable work ethic of migrant workers
encouraged domestic workers to work harder.” (Dench, 2006)
In Saleheen and Shadforth (2006) it was argued that immigration of higher skilled (or
more productive) workers could temporarily raise the domestic rate of productivity
growth; and that immigrant labour could lower the natural rate of unemployment, either
by filling skill gaps (assuming that foreign-born workers are complementary to the
domestic workforce) or by tempering wage demands, as wage bargainers become aware
that they can be replaced more easily than in the past. In support of the latter argument,
the OECD Economic Outlook notes that “international as well as UK evidence suggests
immigration can serve to make the labour market as a whole more fluid and wages less
sensitive to demand fluctuations (2006b, p.68).”
Katz and Krueger (1999) argue that recruitment agencies for temporary workers have
also contributed to declines in the natural rate. Shimer (1998) argues that time series
changes in the natural rate of unemployment in the US are driven by demographic
changes; the declining natural rate of unemployment over the past decade or so has
resulted from declines in the proportion of individuals in the population that had high
propensities for unemployment. So the aging of the baby boom generation was
particularly important as the proportion of the population that was young – and subject to
high unemployment rates – declined over time.
25

The analogy for the UK is that the workforce has increased in size as a result of adding a
group – the A10 – with a relatively low propensity to be unemployed and to claim
benefits. The workforce appears more flexible and mobile than it was before the entry of
workers from the A10. Borjas, for example, argues that
“immigration greases the wheels of the labour market by injecting into the
economy a group of persons who are very responsive to regional
differences in economic opportunities” (Borjas, 2001, p.2).
This has the effect of improving labour market efficiency and hence leads to a more
efficient allocation of national resources.
In thinking about aggregate demand, most people would agree that immigrants are extra
consumers and that they raise aggregate consumption demand. It is likely that
immigrants spend a lower fraction of their income when compared to domestic workers,
perhaps because they send remittances back home or spend less on durable goods while
temporarily resident in the UK – this would, on its own, suggest that immigrants raise
demand by less than they raise supply. However, the funds that migrants send home
might be recycled back to the UK through greater export demand, and UK consumers
might also benefit from lower prices as a result of the extra productivity of migrants.
Aggregate demand might also rise because of increased investment. The theoretical
argument here is that firms require both labour and capital to produce their output.
Immigration gives them more labour, and firms may wish to supplement this with more
capital. But the extent to which investment rises, and how quickly, will depend on the
skills of immigrants and the technologies of firms. If firms are able to substitute between
labour and capital, then there may be a smaller impact on investment than might
otherwise be the case. Early work by Welch (1969), Griliches (1970) and Berndt and
Christensen (1974) all suggested that physical capital is more complementary with skilled
than with unskilled labour. More recently, Lewis (2006) found that US cities with a larger
share of migrant labour are also the ones with less capital intensive production
technologies.
On balance we would suggest that at present it appears that the recent inflow of workers
from the A10 has acted to reduce the natural rate of unemployment in the UK. But it also
seems that it is likely to have raised potential supply by more than it has raised demand,
and thereby has acted to reduce inflationary pressures. This argument holds for three
reasons. First, the consumption behaviour of native workers may have been affected by
the increased ‘fear’ of unemployment resulting from a more flexible labour market.
Second, the recycling of remitted funds back to the UK is unlikely to be perfect. Third,
firms may be able to substitute between capital and labour, offsetting some of the
potential for investment spending to rise.
Consistent with the results from previous studies, such as Manacorda et al (2007), Chart 4
shows that regions with the biggest increases from Eastern Europe have tended to see the

26

smallest rises in their unemployment rates.47 48 This is consistent with the possibility that
foreign workers are attracted to those regions where the unemployment rate is lowest and
opportunities are greatest, for which there appears to be some evidence. There is
tentative evidence, however, in contrast to some other studies, to suggest that A8 workers
have lowered wage inflation among the least skilled. Chart 5 shows a negative
relationship between the change in the annual rate of wage inflation of those in
elementary occupations (defined in the LFS as SOC 9) between 2005 and 2006 and the
change in the share of A8 workers one year earlier, as recorded in the WRS in 2004 and
2005, across regions. The downward sloping line is consistent with a reduction in wage
pressures brought about by immigration, or an increase in the fear of unemployment, or
both.49
We know that most immigrants are young (43% of workers on the WRS are aged 18-24),
and that the most recent rise in the aggregate unemployment rate has been
disproportionately driven by an increase in youth unemployment. In fact, the proportion
of total unemployment accounted for by 18-24 year olds has been rising steadily, from
24.3% of the total in 2000, to 30.7% in 2006Q3 and 31.6% March-May 2007. So what
about the possibility that the influx of migrants has increased the youth unemployment
rate? Chart 6 shows that there is only a weakly positive, but statistically insignificant,
relationship between those regions that have witnessed the largest increases in youth
unemployment and those that have seen the biggest influxes of new immigrants.
It seems that the increase in unemployment in the UK has had relatively little to do with
the influx of temporary workers from Eastern Europe. Hughes (2007) also concluded that
the arrivals from the A10 have had little or no impact on unemployment and aggregate wages
in Ireland. A similar conclusion was reached by FÁS (2006), the Irish Training and
Employment Authority:
“while definitive conclusions could not be drawn from the data, the
statistics would suggest that displacement is not a major or widespread
issue in the current circumstances of the Irish economy.” (2007, p. 43).
Metcalf (2007) summarises a large body of evidence that suggests that the introduction
of, and subsequent raises in, the National Minimum Wage has also had little or no impact
on employment or unemployment. There is also no empirical evidence whatsoever to
support the claim that unemployment in the UK has increased because wages have not
been sufficiently flexible downwards. The UK has a flexible labour market and has
policies in place (Jean and Jiménez, 2007), which are likely to have minimised the impact
on employment and unemployment of the recent inflow of workers from the A10.
47

Note that the negative correlation shown in Chart 1 is not statistically significant. A regression of the
change in the total unemployment rate (between 2005Q3 and 2006Q3) on the change in the share of new
immigrants (between 2005 and 2006) gives a t-statistic of -1.02.

48

One might consider weighting the regional shares of immigrants to reflect the number of employees in
each region as a bigger effect might be expected in regions which have received more migrants. However,
WRS data suggest that while most migrants settle in London and the South East, the ratio of A8 migrants to
the current population by region is broadly the same nationwide, at around 1:67.

49

The correlation coefficient is -0.32.

27

Replacement rates, for example are low and job protection measures are also well below
OECD averages (OECD, 2004).50 Rising labour market slack, which has occurred in the
UK since mid 2005 has likely reduced worker's bargaining power (Blanchflower and
Oswald, 1994a, 1994b) as has a rising fear of unemployment.
Workers are better able to match to available jobs and the workforce is more flexible than
it was previously and hence the (non-inflationary) growth potential of the UK economy
has improved. That is to say trend GDP is likely to have risen with the acquisition of
these new workers from the A10. The presence of highly productive workers from the
A10 who are prepared to work for relatively low wages along with associated increases in
actual unemployment are what has helped to keep wages down. There is little or no
evidence of any displacement effects of natives or previous migrants.
5. Conclusions and summary
Over the period 1971-2004, population growth in the UK ranks 31st out of 38 nations
with only Germany (East and West) and seven East European countries having had
slower population growth (Czech Republic; Croatia; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia, Romania
and Bulgaria). All the other major industrialised nations have had faster rates of
population growth.
The UK population has grown at a faster pace since the turn of the millennium. This
recent growth has been driven primarily by changes in net migration. Both the inflow
and outflow migration rates have risen but the inflow rate has risen more rapidly, most
recently, with an influx of migrants from eight East European countries. However, the
increase in the net migration flow predates the influx of A8 workers, reflecting a steady
rise in the number of immigrants from Asia and the Middle East too.
The propensity to come from the A8 countries to the UK to work is higher the lower is
GDP per capita in each of the A8 countries. The decision is also strongly correlated with
life satisfaction scores and unemployment rates, but is uncorrelated with employment
rates or rates of inflation.
There is reason to believe that the majority of workers who have arrived in the UK from
the A8 have not come permanently. When surveyed only 9% said they expected to stay
for more than two years. Hence, in our view it is inappropriate to call them migrants,
whereas in fact they should more appropriately be considered temporary workers.
The recent arrivals from the A10 are different from those who have arrived from other
countries. The A10 arrivals are much more likely to work, have lower wages, be
educated, be self-employed, be younger and are especially likely to live in households
with at least three adults.
There appears to be consistent evidence from the Worker Registration Scheme and
National Insurance Number applications that approximately 600,000 individuals from the
A8 countries had come to work in the UK between May 2004 and mid 2007. But other
50

According to this study the United States, the UK and Canada "remain the least regulated countries" in
the OECD (OECD, 2004, p.71).

28

sources suggest a significant proportion of these workers – perhaps as many as a half have returned to their country of origin.
The empirical literature from around the world suggests little or no evidence that
immigrants have had a major impact on native labour market outcomes such as wages
and unemployment. However, we do find tentative evidence that the pay of those most
susceptible to competition from workers from the A10 have seen a fall in their wages.
The UK is a highly flexible labour market: recent work by the OECD (Jean and Jiménez,
2007) suggests that the labour market policies in place in the UK are likely to have
minimised the impact of the worker inflow.
There is evidence that the fear of unemployment has risen recently in the UK. This is
likely to have contained wage pressure.
The impact of the recent influx of workers from the A10 countries on the UK economy
will be determined by the extent to which such workers add to supply relative to demand,
since it is the balance between these two factors that determines prospects for inflation.
At present it appears that the inflow of workers from Eastern Europe has tended to
increase supply by more than it has increased demand in the UK, and thereby acted to
reduce inflationary pressures and reduce the natural or equilibrium rate of unemployment
over the past few years.

The TIM number is calculated by multiplying the recorded number of A8 visitors to the UK in 2006
(http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=12222&Pos=&ColRank=1&Rank=272) by the
proportion who intend to stay less than 3 months according to the WRS (55%), multiplied by 1.25, to
accommodate the extra quarter (2007 Q1).
