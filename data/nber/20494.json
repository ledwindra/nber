    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explores the relationship between inflation and the existence of a publicly-traded, long-maturity, nominal, domestic-currency bond market.  Bond holders suffer from inflation and could be a potent anti-inflationary force; I ask whether their presence is apparent empirically.  I use a panel data approach, examining the difference in inflation before and after the introduction of a bond market.  My primary focus is on countries with inflation targeting regimes, though I also examine countries with hard fixed exchange rates and other monetary regimes.  Inflation-targeting countries with a bond market experience inflation approximately three to four percentage points lower than those without a bond market.  This effect is economically and statistically significant; it is also insensitive to a variety of estimation strategies, including using political and fiscal instrumental variables.  The existence of a bond market has little effect on inflation in other monetary regimes, as do indexed or foreign-denominated bonds.\n\n",
