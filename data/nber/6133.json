    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops a simple framework for examining human capital accumulation, unemployment, and relative wages in a global economy.  It builds on the models of Davis (1997a, b) of trade between a flexible wage America and a rigid wage Europe. To this it adds a model of human capital accumulation based on Findlay and Kierzkowski (1983).  A variety of comparative statics are examined, including changes in educational capital and population, entry of new countries to the trading world, technical change, and a productivity slowdown.  We derive the consequences for the skilled-to-unskilled wage gap, unemployment, and skill composition.\n\n",
