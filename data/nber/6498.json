Powerful groups dynamically interact via fiscal process that effectively allows open access to the aggregate capital stock.  In equilibrium, this leads to slow economic growth and a  voracity effect,' by which a shock, such as a terms of trade windfall, perversely generates a more than proportionate increase in fiscal redistribution and reduces growth.  We also show that a dilution in the concentration of power leads to faster growth and a less procyclical response to shocks.\n\n",
