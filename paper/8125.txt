1. The old and the new Mezzogiorno
The economic problems of the Italian Mezzogiorno are well known and have been extensively
studied by many authors.1 Despite massive aid from the north, the economy of the south does
not seem to catch up with the north. Its economy lags behind and is unable to develop the kind
of productivity that would enable it to successfully compete with other regions in Europe. By
way of contrast, the north has performed marvellously. Lombardia, Emilia Romagna,
Trentino-Alto Adige and Valle d’Aosta are now among the highly productive regions of
Europe, matching regions like Rheinland-Pfalz, Haute-Normandie or Noord-Brabant.2
There now seems to be a second Mezzogiorno – East Germany. After German
reunification many authors asked themselves whether a comparison between East Germany
and the Mezzogiorno was justified, but they typically came to a negative conclusion.3 The
initial growth performance of east Germany after unification was so promising that a
comparison with the Mezzogiorno seemed far fetched. Today, however, time has brought
more evidence. The evidence shows that the fundamental differences between Italy’s south
and Germany’s east that some authors had expected initially, have not materialised. In fact, as
this paper will argue, there is a striking similarity between the two regions both in terms of the
characteristics and the causes of the economic problems from which they suffer.

2. Historic Differences and Present Similarities

Different Histories
In order to place the problem in the right perspective, a look at the history is useful. From a
historical point of view it would be hard to find any two regions in Europe that were as
different as east Germany and southern Italy were before the second world war.4 At the time,
southern Italy was a predominantly agrarian region with an agricultural share in the work
force of about 56% in 1936, and its per capita income was 60% of that of the rest of Italy, the
Centro Nord5. East Germany (using today’s definition), on the other hand was more
productive than west Germany with an agricultural share of only 22,1% and a per capita
income of 27% above that of West Germany. In fact, east Germany was most productive
region of continental Europe, hosting some of the world’s most advanced firms in the areas of
precision engineering, optics, chemicals and aircraft production.

4

In this paper we define east Germany as the former territory of the GDR (East Berlin, MecklenburgVorpommern, Sachsen, Thüringen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Brandenburg) and west Germany as the remaining parts of
Germany in today’s boundaries. Similarly, southern Italy (the Italian Mezzogiorno) is defined as the provinces of
Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicilia and Sardegna and “northern” Italy or the
“Centro Nord” as the rest of Italy, again in its current borders.

After the war, east Germany became the industrial showcase of the eastern bloc, with
an enormously high labour share of manufacturing in the order of 34%. By contrast, the
corresponding manufacturing share in southern Italy was only about 20%.

Low per Capita Output, Low Growth and no Visible Convergence
Given these historical differences, it would be more than surprising if the two regions were
similar today. Yet, they are. The most striking similarity is shown in figure 1 which illustrates
the labour productivity aggregates in the two regions relative to the rest of their respective
countries for all years for which common data are available. While south Italian labour

6
productivity has been slightly below 60% with a declining tendency over the period
considered, east German productivity was very low in 1991, but increased rapidly thereafter.
This rapid increase induced the initial optimism among the politicians and some economists.
Currently, however, no further increase is visible. Since 1996, where aggregate labour
productivity peaked at 59%, the level has not increased any further and is even declining. In
fact, it seems that both Mezzogiornos’ productivity figures have been unable to permanently
exceed the 60%-level. Of course, no one knows whether this is mere chance and how the
future will be. However, at present, no change in this situation is visible.

The halt in convergence is also demonstrated in figure 2 which compares the growth,
or better shrinking rates of the two Mezzogiornos relative to the rest of their respective

In 2000, Germany’s system of national accounts has been changed in a way which makes it more difficult to
trace the productivity figures back to the former communist region, because the two parts of Berlin are no longer
distinguished. The quoted figures were recalculated from the new GEP figures on the basis of the old borders by

countries, again for all years for which common data are available. The figure shows that,
over the last four years, the respective regions have drifted away from the more productive
parts of their countries rather that converging with them.

The time period for east Germany is too short to be sure about a lack of convergence.
However, in the Italian case, sufficient information is available. In the 1950ies the Italian
Mezzogiorno had shown a substantial amount of growth, allowing for some sort of catching
up process. However, thereafter, from about 1960 – the introduction of the “erga omnes”
wages rule -- no further convergence has been visible. To provide harder evidence of this fact,
we applied a statistical test based on unit root procedures looking at the time path in the cross
regional differences in real per capita income. Taking all available data from 1970 – 1998 into
account, we reject the hypothesis of convergence. In fact, we find that there is a significant

8
time trend in the output differences which implies that the two regions have been drifting
apart. The appendix explains the details of our test.

Transfer Economies
The low productivity of the two Mezzogiornos would result in huge income differentials
relative to the more developed parts of their countries, if the two regions had to live on their
own. However, substantial fiscal transfers via central budgets have effectively reduced the
size of these differentials.
In Germany, the main fiscal transfers flow via the social security system since
unification not only brought the same currency and the same economic laws, but also the
integration into the same social health, pension and unemployment systems. More than 60%
of all transfers fall into these categories. In addition, the Solidarpakt Ost defined a financial
transfer among the Länder in the order of 32% of the total or currently about 25 billion

more than 14% of the annual total. Most of the funds channelled to the east have been

rates and the breakdown of the EMS in 1992 (see Sinn 1999), and it explains why Germany
was unable to meet the Maastricht debt criterion. The west German public debt was about 450

In Italy, there are various channels for transfers from the north to the south, but as Italy
is not a federal state, the transfers are not regularly documented. In 1987, the Bank of Italy
estimated the net transfers from the Centro-Nord to the Mezzogiorno to amount to 35 bill.
Euro. Galli and Onado (1990) estimate the transfers to amount to 43 bill. Euro in 1988.
Although there is the Patto di Stabilita Interno which resembles the German LänderFinanzausgleich, Faini and Galli (1993) argue that most funds are channelled in a hidden way
through the federal budget. Minimum pensions, the national health service, unemployment
insurance

and public expenditures which are financed by the federal government are

probably the major redistribution mechanisms. Faini and Galli (1993) further point out that
financial subsidies to investment, first introduced in the 1960s, have reduced the cost of long
term capital in Southern manufacturing by about 40%. There are even more indirect transfers
than these. For example, public firms have to invest most of their funds in southern Italy and,
according to Alesina et. al. (1999), public employment also plays a major role in the
redistribution process. In fact, while the shares of employees in the government sector are

10
between 12% and 15% in Central Nord, the Mezzogiorno has a share of 22 %.7 Expressed as
public employees per resident in working age (between 15 and 65 years of age), the numbers
are less dramatic, but point in the same direction. While in the north of Italy, there are 6.5
public employees per resident, the equivalent figure for the south is 8 - thus public
employment in the South is about 20% higher than in the north. By contrast, east Germany
has only a government share which is three percentage points more than in the west. Recently,
the internal Italian subsidies have gone down and have partly been replaced with EU
subsidies, which in 1999 amounted to about 3 billion

Note: The official absorption statistics for Germany are available only until 1994. In the subsequent years,
absorption has been calculated from the official GDP and transfer figures by adding an estimate of the private
capital import based on Ifo’s investment data base.

The public transfers and private capital movements made it possible for the people
living in the Mezzogiornos to consume more than they produced. Figure 3 shows the time
paths of aggregate absorption – the resources consumed by private households, firms and the
government – and GDP. The difference between these two variables is the import surplus.
The figures also demonstrate, how much of this surplus is financed with public transfers and
private capital flows.8 In the east German case, the import surplus is currently about 46% of
east German GDP, and in the Italian case its is about 12% of south Italian GDP.
The two regions’ dependency on resource imports is extraordinary. Figure 4 ranks
different countries and regions of the world with regard to their respective net import shares in
GDP. It can be seen that east Germany, in particular, contrasts sharply with the others
depicted in the figure. Southern Italy, on the other hand resembles economies like Israel and

veritable transfer economy, but it has found its master with its German counterpart. In the
Italian Mezzogiorno every seventh Lira spent comes from the north, but in east Germany
every third deutschmark comes from the west.

Obviously, the south Italian reliance on external resources is much smaller than the
east German one if compared to the south Italian GDP. However, southern Italy is relatively
much larger than east Germany. While east Germany is inhabited by 18% of the German
population, southern Italy includes 36% of the total Italian population. Moreover, the private
capital import to southern Italy is less important than the private capital import to east
Germany which is still is heavily subsidised. These two aspects explain why the order of
magnitude of the resource transfers appears more similar when the transfers are related to the
GDP of the paying region rather than that of the recipient region. While internal German
public and private transfers comprise 6.2% of the west German GDP, the internal Italian
transfers amount to 4.2% of north Italian GDP.
It is not surprising that transfer economies have high incomes despite their low
productivity. In 1997 east German disposable household income per capita was 85% of the
west German one, and southern Italy’s disposable income per capita was 65% of the
respective figure in Centro Nord. Pensions are even 10% higher in east than in west Germany
because more women were working in the communist state and because the GDR pension
claims had been converted with overly generous terms.9

3. The Reasons
The lack of productivity convergence between the Mezzogiornos and the more developed
north of Italy and west of Germany cannot easily be explained with a primitive two-factor
variant of the neo-classical model. Operating in the same country implies the same legal
system and full access to the technological knowledge which is available in the more
developed region. Thus, the production function should be the same and, with constant returns

9

See Nierhaus (1999).

14
to scale, capital and labour movements imply equal factor prices. Equal factor prices, in turn,
imply equal capital intensities and equal labour productivities.
When the neo-classical model is enriched with location preferences of the population
and capital adjustment costs, it will not imply an immediate convergence, but a gradual
convergence with two sided guest-worker flows during the adjustment phase, which in the
end will also lead to a full equalisation of factor prices and productivities.10 So, why is it then
that convergence does not occur?

Locational Disadvantages
To find an answer, a yet more extended version of the neo-classical model could be
considered where land and similar idiosyncratic location factors are taken into account, which
cannot be altered. If a region has a worse location than another one, say, because its transport
costs to existing centres are high and/or its infrastructure is bad, it will have a lower “total”
factor productivity with regard to capital and labour. In the case of location preferences of the
labour force, this will imply a low capital intensity of production, a low labour productivity
and low wages.
Such a situation could apply in the two Mezzogiornos which are both located at the
outskirts of the EU and are still lacking in adequate quality of their local infrastructure. If it
prevails and if a steady state growth path with a constant regional structure prevails,
investment per capita will be lower than in the rest of the country. The lower level of per
capita investment will not have to show up in terms of construction investment, because local
land prices are low, but in terms of low levels of equipment investment which consists mainly
of traded commodities.

10

See Sinn (2000). Ordinary neo-classical growth models of the Solow or „endogenous growth“ variety are not
well suited to studying regional convergence, because they abstract from labour migration and assume an
internal capital formation from domestic savings rather than capital movements.

15
Figure 5 illustrates the time paths of construction and equipment investment in the two
Mezzogiornos. The figure shows that east Germany is performing much better than southern
Italy, with an impressive level of construction investment and substantially more equipment
investment. However, recently even the east German equipment investment per capita has
fallen significantly below the west German value, indicating a clear halt in convergence of the
relative capital endowments. In southern Italy equipment investment was only about 40% of
that in northern Italy, and in east Germany it was about 88% of that in west Germany.

Unemployment
Roughly speaking, the observed level of investment seems to be compatible with the neoclassical model thus described. Note, however, that the neo-classical model would predict full

16
employment. The low wage would imply a low population density, since many natives would
work and live in other regions, but it would not imply unemployment. As table 3 shows, this
prediction is not compatible with reality, though. In the Italian Mezzogiorno, unemployment
is 22%, but in the north it is only 6,5%, and the respective figures for east and west Germany
are 17,2% and 8,2%. Obviously the two Mezzogiornos do have severe employment problems.

The neo-classical model can explain unemployment with wages that exceed the
market clearing level, and under the assumptions made it would be sufficient for such an
outcome if the Mezzogiorno wage were equal to the wage in the region with the better
location conditions. The high wage creates unemployment, which, because of the HarrisTodardo argument, prevails in a migration equilibrium. It drives capital away, and although it
tends to increase the capital intensity inside the firms, it further reduces the aggregate capital
intensity and the aggregate labour productivity in terms of the number of people in working
age.

Proxy Negotiations
The question remains why wages have been set at a level above the market clearing wage.
Surprisingly, the answers for the two Mezzogiornos are very similar indeed.
In Italy, regions could set their wages separately during the fifties and early sixties,
and this was the time when the south showed signs of catching up with the north. However, in

17
the late sixties, trade unions gained power (in the autunno caldo movement) and succeeded in
equalising the wages throughout Italy in collective nation-wide wage agreements.11 The
system of nation-wide wage formation has been operating since then and has effectively
equalised union wages in the north and the south. In 1999, the system was modified by
reintroducing the possibility of regional wage differentiation, but as of today this modification
has not had any influence.
In east Germany, wages were only about one third of those in the west after the
German currency union in 1990, but the subsequent wage negotiations brought about a rapid
wage adjustment, even though Germany’s collective wage bargaining is carried out on a
regional rather than national level. The reason why the German negotiations nevertheless
resulted in a wage adjustment lies in the fact that it was the west German competitors of the
east German firms that had effectively taken over the task of negotiating the east German
wages. In 1991, when the decisive wage settlements took place, the Treuhand agency had just
started to privatise the ex-communist economy, and at that time there were no private
entrepreneurs who could have participated in the wage negotiations. Thus west German
employers stepped in as proxy negotiators. Moreover, the newly founded unions were under
full western control. Thus, in the negotiations westerners sat at both sides of the tables, and
they unanimously agreed to fully equalise the union wages as quickly as possible, which
basically meant tripling them. They even agreed to unusual five-year contracts which fully
specified the wage equalisation path in order to bind future east German firms and to
effectively prevent them from threatening their markets.
It is unclear to the authors whether similar motives were driving the collective
negotiations in Italy, too. However, it seems plausible to assume, given that the wage had to
be uniform, that the employers and unions of the north had a much larger influence on the

determination of the Italian wages than those of the south and that they followed their own
objectives, disregarding the problems of the Mezzogiorno.

Overdrawn Wages
The implications of the Italian and German wage negotiations are shown in figure 6, which
gives the time paths of hourly wage cost in manufacturing for different countries and regions.
In this figure, the west German wage cost in manufacturing is set equal to 100, since it is the
highest in the world. All other wage costs are expressed in relation to the German one.

The figure shows that east German wages have increased dramatically in the last
decade although a full equalisation of actual wages has not taken place. Before unification,
the east German wage cost in manufacturing was 7% of the west German wage, when
calculated at the then prevailing exchange rate. Now it is over 70%. Wages were quadrupled
by the one-to-one currency conversion in 1990 because this was an effective revaluation by
the factor 4.3. And thereafter they were tripled in the proxy negotiations which did not,
however, the for reasons explained below, fully affect the actual wages. No economy in the
world could have survived the a ten-fold increase in the relative wage that was experienced by
east Germany in only ten years. It should be stressed that the figure refers to the
manufacturing sector whose wages are more moderate than those of others because the

20
competitive pressure is higher. In the government sector and elsewhere actual wages have
reached about 85% of those in the west.
That the east German wage policy was beyond all economic reason, can best be seen
by comparing the east German wages with those of other countries. The figure shows that the
east German wages surpassed the Irish wages as early as 1991 although the east German
economy had nearly completely collapsed in a depression that was much more severe than the
great depression at the end of the twenties. In 1992 when the German depression still was
pronounced the east German wage curve cut the US wage curve, and in 1992/1993 it even cut
the south and north Italian wage curves. The Swedish wage curve was hit in 1995, but due to
a recovery of the Swedish crown east German wages have remained below the Swedish ones
since then.
The Italian wages were, on average, at about 80% of the West German wages in the
beginning of the nineties when a thousand lira cost about 1,40 deutschmarks, but with the
collapse of the EMS in 1992 the value of the lira began to sink down to a minimum of about
0,82 deutschmarks in 1995. Also the Scala mobile was abolished in that year which allowed
real wages to fall. Both effects reduced the wages to about 50% of the German wages and
boosted the competitiveness of the Italian economy. Since then the south and north Italian
wages have come up again and are now at 62% and 72%, respectively, of the west German
ones.
Through the period considered the wage gap between northern and southern Italy has
remained at about 15% of the northern level. As in Germany, this gap is probably due to the
fact that north Italian wages exceed the nation-wide union wages on average, while south
Italian wages are rather close to the union wages.
It is remarkable, though, that the wage gap between east and west Germany is about
twice as large as the gap between the two Italian regions considered. In west Germany there is
a gap between union and actual wages of about 15% . With a zero gap in the east, this in itself

21
would have resulted in a wage convergence to 85% of the western level, just as in Italy. The
reason why the gap is much larger than this lies in the fact that east German firms found a
way to avoid the union wages altogether. Most of the new firms founded in east Germany
after 1991 decided not to join the employers unions in order not to be covered by the initial
wage agreements, and many other firms have simply violated the wage contracts with the tacit
agreement of the unions. Many firms went bankrupt and were founded again as new legal
entities in order to circumvent the binding power of the collective wage contracts. The result
is that currently about 85% of east German firms and more than 55% of east German
employees have wage contracts below the union wages. The economy has found a way to
partly heal the initial mistakes. Nevertheless, the initial wage agreements and the supportive
public statements by politicians have been able to catapult the east German wages to where
they are now and if only for psychological reasons it will be hardly possible to return to more
moderate wages in the near future.
As was shown in figure 1, the two Mezzogiornos both have an aggregate productivity
which is less than 60% of the respective productivity in the more advanced parts of the two
countries. Thus, it seems, the wages should also stand at the 60%. However they do not. The
east German wages are more than 70% of the west German ones and the south Italian wages
are 85% of the north Italian ones. This is the problem
That the wages are too high becomes particularly obvious when the Irish situation is
considered. Thirty years ago, when Ireland joined the EU, Ireland had a GDP per capita which
was only a quarter of that of Germany. Today it has reached about 90 percent of the German
GDP. Ireland is the fastest growing region in the EU with real growth rates of about 8% per
year. The Irish GDP per capita of the population in working age is currently 80% more than
the respective figure in southern Italy and 46% more than the east German value, but the Irish
wage cost per hour is only 85% of the respective south Italian figure and only 76% of the

22
east German one. It is clear why Ireland is a much better location for mobile capital than
southern Italy or east Germany and why its general economic performance is so much better.

4. Dutch Disease in Italy and Germany
Despite the possibility of explaining the combination of low productivity, high wages and a
lack of convergence as a long-run equilibrium phenomenon, it is not clear that the situation
will always be like that. After all, as already mentioned, Italy has allowed regional wage
differentiation in 1999, and in east Germany an increasing number of firms simply quit the
employers’ associations. This new development will bring more dynamism to the labour
markets whose consequences will have to be guarded.
Unfortunately, however, there is at least one important reason why optimistic
expectations do not seem to be justified at this stage. This is the existence of the welfare state
which, as was explained above, is channelling vast amounts of resources into the two
retarding regions. The welfare transfers are partly motivated by the wish to compensate for
the regional disadvantages, partly they are the seemingly self-evident implication of nationwide social security systems. But whatever their causes, they effectively change the incentive
structure in the economy and draw human resources away from productive activities towards
others for which the government is willing to pay. This may involve rent seeking with public
projects and criminal activities, but the most important element undoubtedly is the direct
repercussion on the labour market. In Germany, early retirement schemes, unemployment
benefits, retraining programmes and, in particular, social welfare, have to be mentioned,
which all have effectively increased the reservation wage and pulled parts of the labour force
away from the regular labour market. In Italy the situation is very similar, but the emphasis is
on different aspects of the welfare system.
In Italy the pension system has a particularly strong diverting effect on the labour
market, because the rules under which early retirement is possible are very generous. While in

23
Germany two thirds of the population between 55 and 64 years of age are still working, in
Italy, this share is only 43%. On the other hand, unemployment benefits are paid in Italy only
for a relatively short time period of up to 6 months. In Germany, the maximum number of
months is 32, which is two and a half years.
In Germany, social aid programmes are a particular problem since they implicitly
define a minimum wage income below which no one is willing to work. In east Germany, an
individual receives about 9,416

definitely too high. It is impossible to run a market economy when the minimum income
guaranteed through the welfare system is equal to the average net-of-tax wage income.
To gain a more systematic overview of the problem, figure 7 offers an international
comparison which contrasts the social aid level for a family of five with the respective
country’s or region’s average net wage income. The figure confirms the impression that the
problem is particularly severe in east Germany, where social aid is at a record level. In Italy,
by contrast, the share of wages in social aid is rather small by international standards.

Note: The tax burden of a family of five was computed as the income tax plus employee social security
contributions less cash benefits and was deducted from gross wages to obtain the net wage income. The gross
income is that of an average worker in manufacturing.

With regard to the private industry the disincentives created by the public transfers to
southern Italy and east Germany are very similar to the Dutch disease phenomenon which was
intensely discussed by economists in the early eighties.12 If a country detects a large quantity
of natural resources, which it can sell on the world market, the domestic currency tends to
appreciate, and with rising wages some of the labour force is relocated to the resource sector.
The international competitiveness of the manufacturing sector falls, and resource exports
crowd out commodity exports produced by that sector.
It is true that none of the two Mezzogiornos enjoy an abundance of natural resources,
and they do not have a separate currency either. The effects observed in the Dutch disease
case nevertheless reappear. For one thing, it does not matter whether a region receives a gift
of nature or a gift from another region. The inflow of financial funds has similar

25
consequences. For another, the terms of trade effect does not need a formal currency
appreciation. It may also be brought about by internal price adjustments.
In the case of the two Mezzogiornos the various types of idleness – from retirement
via sickness and unemployment to laziness -- which are financed with the social transfers are
similar to the occupation in the resource sector, and the appreciation shows up in the increase
of the wage rate and the prices of land and non-traded commodities resulting therefrom. These
effects may perpetuate the problems discussed in the previous section despite the new
flexibility of wages resulting from most recent developments.
As was mentioned, in Holland the resource sales crowded out some of the exportintensive manufacturing industry. Table 4 shows that this aspect too, has its analogy in the
two Mezzogiornos. The table compares the sectoral composition of employment in the four
regions considered and reports the differences in the respective percentage points of
employment shares. It shows that, relative to the north, southern Italy lacks 7 percentage
points of manufacturing employment and, relative to the west, east Germany lacks about 10
percentage points. The latter is particularly alarming if it is considered that, during the
existence of the GDR, the east German manufacturing share exceeded the west German one
by 4.4 percentage points, being one of the highest in the world.13

This completes the analysis of the causes of the Mezzogiorno problem. It is debatable
whether the term “disease” was really appropriate for the Dutch restructuring process, because
this process manifested a useful reaction to the new resource situation. However, in the case
of southern Italy and east Germany, the term clearly is appropriate for describing what is
going on. The artificial wage equalisation and voluminous transfers for non-market activities
is a dangerous blend of interventions in the market economy that will prolong the sickness of
the Italian and German Mezzogiornos.

5. The Cures
If there is a disease, a cure is needed. One obvious cure is, as explained, decentralised wage
bargaining, and it seems that the first steps towards such a system have already been taken in
the two countries. It is not enough, however, that the negotiations are shifted from the centre
to the provinces. Germany has a system which is based on provinces, and yet this system
proved unable to correct the initial mistakes in the proxy negotiations. An arguably better

27
system is one where only wage guidelines are negotiated on the province level, and where the
single companies would then have the right to agree on lower wages if they wished. Thereby,
many marginal firms which are at the brink of bankruptcy could be rescued, and new firms
could more easily get started. In east Germany, the association of the metal and electric
industries of Thuringia has recently negotiated such a revolutionary new wage contract. This
might be a good example for others.
Decentralised bargaining would not help very much, however, unless the social system
is reformed. In Germany, and to a lesser extent in Italy, social aid is a major problem for the
labour market. Currently the system is designed such that the government pays people for
being idle, and, as explained, this fact implies that social aid is too high a lower boundary on
wages. The alternative is to pay people for working, as is done with the Earned Income Tax
Credit of the United States which recently was also introduced in Finland. In Germany the
government takes away one deutschmark of aid if the individual earns one additional
deutschmark. In the US, the government instead adds 40 cents to every dollar earned up to a
certain income target. Unlike the German system this system does not impose a lower
boundary on wages but, to the contrary, induces people to actively seek jobs even if they are
badly paid, because they can then claim more money from the government. This reduces the
wage for unqualified labour and creates jobs. The jobs are created everywhere, in households
and firms even without more capital formation. However, when wages are lower, it can be
expected that more capital will flow into the region. The overall labour productivity in the
sense of GDP per population in working age increases, and at least some productivity
convergence can take place.
While the American system is run on such a low scale that it was unable to
avoid the problem of the working poor, Italy and Germany could install more generous
systems, fitting their social democratic traditions. This system would not necessarily be more
expensive than the current one. In fact, it can easily be shown that the government will save

28
money if the labour demand elasticity is above unity and a total income for unqualified labour
equal to the current level of social aid is aimed at. Conversely, if the government is willing to
spend the same amount of money on social aid as today, the degree of target achievement for
social policies will increase if all people whose wages fall because of the new system receive
social aid.
In Italy such a system is less urgent than in Germany not only because social aid is
lower relative to wages, but also because black market activities seem to be more common
among the recipients of social aid. Black market work is better than no work. Yet, a system
that induces black market activities is certainly inferior to one which relies on official labour
contracts, because it is unable to fully exploit the benefits of specialisation and economies of
large scale.
This remark also applies to the Italian pension system which is hardly sustainable in a
country which has the lowest birth rates in the world. The necessary pension cuts enforced by
the changing demographic composition of the population could easily be enacted by
increasing the retirement age instead of cutting the pension per year. Policemen do not have to
retire at 50 to become black market employees of lawyers thereafter.
Apart from decentralised bargaining and the Earned Income Tax Credit, it would
probably make sense in Germany and Italy to target the public transfers to infrastructure
investment than to social support, because this would help overcome the locational
disadvantages which are the ultimate reason why wage equalisation policies have been so
harmful.
In 1989 the Italian Prime Minister Andreotti had argued that he liked Germany so
much that he preferred having two Germany rather than one. But this applies to Italy as well.
Indeed, had there been two Germany and two Italy, the kinds of problems studied in this
paper would not have arisen, because neither the artificial wage equalisation nor the
problematic resource transfers would have occurred. However, we hope that the reader will

29
agree with the authors that national unity is a value beyond economics for which it may well
be worth sacrificing five percent of GDP. We are sure that the Italians will not demolish
Garibaldi’s statutes and the Germans will maintain those of Bismarck. After all, there are
possibilities of curing the problems as we have shown.

Appendix
A statistical analysis of the time series properties of output differences between
the Centro Nord and the Mezzogiorno

This appendix discusses the question of whether the Mezzogiorno converges with northern
Italy. Figure 1 clearly illustrates that the per capita incomes of the Centro Nord and
Mezzogiorno of Italy are far from having converged to the same levels. This impression is
confirmed by Boltho et al (1997) who show that there has been a catching up process of the
Mezzogiorno during the fifties, but not during the subsequent decades. They show in a cross
section of Mezzogiorno regions that initial conditions only mattered for the growth
performance during the 1950’s, thus proving evidence of beta-convergence as defined by
Barro (1991). The results by Boltho et al (1997) are confirmed by Boldrin and Canova (2000)
for several less developed regions in Europe.
However, what is less obvious is whether the time path of the regional differences is
moving towards a dynamic steady state where per capita incomes are different or towards a
process of divergence in the long run. We will show that the latter is the case, i.e. the two
parts of the country are indeed drifting apart.
We apply the recently developed time series approach of Bernard and Durlauf (1996).
According to these authors, two series have reached a dynamic steady state if the long term
forecasts made at a given date are equal. The two series have thus converged if

Lim E ( y cn (t + T ) − y mez (t + T ) ℑt ) = 0 ,
T →∞

where E denotes the expectations operator, y denotes per capita GDP, t, time and ℑ denotes
the information set a period t. The subscripts cn and mez indicate the Centro Nord and the
Mezzogiorno.
In practice, the test for this definition of convergence amounts to testing whether the
cross regional differences in real per capita income are a zero mean stationary stochastic
process. This can be done with standard unit root procedures. In order to correct for the small
sample bias, inherent in time series studies based on annual data, we employ finite sample
critical values suggested by Cheung and Lai (1995).

31
Previous evidence from time series tests on output convergence is mixed. While
Bernard and Durlauf (1995) find only little evidence of output convergence, Cheung and
Garcia Pascual (2000) show that some earlier results of non-convergence are attributable to
the low power of the unit root test.
In the following we formally test for the presence of a unit roots or deterministic
component in the difference of the real per capita income in the Centro Nord and the
Mezzogiorno of Italy. The augmented Dickey and Fuller (ADF) test allowing for both an
intercept and a time trend is used. Let X t be the output difference at time t. The ADF test is
based on the regression equation:

y

∆ X t = µ 0 + µ 1t + α X t −1 + α 1 ∆ X t −1 + ... + α p ∆ X t − p + ε t ,

ε t is an error term. The Akaike information

criterion (AIC) is used to determine p, the lag parameter. We start with the most general
model as given above and subsequently drop insignificant parameters. The results of the
regression are reported in table 1 for the aggregate production and 1 a to 1 c for three major
sub-sectors.
The clear significance of the constant in table 1, µ 0 , reflects the difference in the
levels, which are obvious from figure 1. This would be enough to reject the convergence
hypothesis according to the definition by Bernard and Durlauf (1996). In a less strict sense,
one could still interpret the presence of a constant as evidence in favor of conditional
convergence. However, we also reject this concept of convergence, because we cannot reject
the null hypothesis of a unit root in the series, when looking at the Augmented Dickey Fuller
(ADF) test. This implies that changes in the cross country differences of real per capita GDP
are permanent shocks and do not die out completely after a certain period of time.
Furthermore, the time trend, µ 1 , is significant and positive. Although quite small, this implies
that the two regions are in fact significantly diverging over time.
Furthermore, it is of interest to understand which sector in the economy is driving the
divergence of the two regions. Is the problem of Southern Italy a sectoral problem of the
agricultural sector, rather than a regional problem, as often claimed? Tables 1a-c report the
unit root tests for three major sectors of the economies: agriculture, industry and services.
Overall, the results indicate that the divergence phenomenon between the two regions is not
explained by the agricultural sector, as often argued, but rather by the divergence of output

32
per unit of labor in the industry sector - the only one with a significant constant and a
significant time trend in the output differences. Table 1a shows that the output differences in
the agricultural sector and services sector are not significantly different from zero, nor do they
display a significant time trend. For the industry sector, on the other hand, both the constant
and the time trend are significant. The deterioration of the industrial sector is again a common
phenomenon in the Two Mezzogiornos.
