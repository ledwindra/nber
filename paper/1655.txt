ABSTRACT

Despite much recent interest in a consumption tax, the Treasury

Department's November 1984 tax plan proposes to adopt carefully
coordinated features of a more comprehensive income tax, including the
indexation of interest, depreciation, and capital gains.
The May 1985
White House proposal would retain some of these indexing provisions.

Public finance economists in recent

years have

exhibited

progressively less interest in the equity and efficiency properties of a

comprehensive income tax, and

correspondingly

more interest in

those

of

The discussion has centered around

administrative feasibility, the efficient allocation of resources, and

the insulation of taxes to the interference of inflation.

In

particular, a tax on the Haig—Simons definition of income is said to
require

the administratively difficult

indexation

of

interest,

depreciation, and capital gains.

Despite this trend, the U.S. Treasury Department in November 1984

announced their proposal to adopt carefully coordinated features of a
more comprehensive tax on income.

Their plan, described in Tax Reform

for Fairness, Simplicity, and Economic
in the sense that it would broaden the

Growth, is a "modified flat tax"
base and lower the rates, but it

includes other interesting features such as the partial integration of

corporate and personal taxes through a

Perhaps the most innovative and difficult

features of the plan, however, are the attempts to measure a real tax
base through multiple indexing provisions.
These provisions make the original Treasury proposal interesting as

a subject of economic investigation, despite the greater political
viability of the more recent President's Tax Proposals to the Congress

for Fairness, Growth, and Simplicity.

This paper investigates, for

alternative special cases and

assumptions,

the investment incentives

afforded by the current tax system and by these other tax regimes.

It

follows Hall and Jorgenson (1967) by finding the user cost of capital or

pretax return that is required for a marginal investment under each
regime.

It incorporates all of the tax consequences to the firm that

makes the investment and to the saver who provides the finance.

The

difference between the pretax return and the posttax return for each
project is a marginal effective tax rate along the lines of Auerbach and

Jorgenson (1980), Gravelie (1982), or Hulten and Robertson (1984).

In

particular, like King and Fullerton (1984), this paper includes all
interactions among corporate taxes, personal taxes, and state and local
property taxes. Like Fullerton arid Henderson (1984), it goes beyond the

corporate sector to include taxation of capital in the noncorporate

sector and in owner—occupied housing.

This addition is important

because the corporate sector contains only one--third of the U.S. capital

stock. Another third is in owner—occupied housing while the final third
is in the noncorporate business sector, including rental housing.

The model, described in Section 2, is based on assumptions of
perfect competition, factor mobility, and perfect certainty. It assumes
that the firm invests in each asset until the net return just equals the

net cost of funds, using two separate ways to determine that cost.

It

shows the effective total tax on the income from investment in any of 36

different assets in 18 different industries. To weight these marginal

rates together for a given tax regime, it takes an equiproportional

— 3—

increase in all assets and in all personal savings. The model in this

paper can accorrunodate any indexed or unindexed provisions for
depreciation, interest, or capital gains.

It is also generalized to

allow alternative dividend provisions.

While the proposals involve sweeping changes to fringe benefits,
charitable contributions, arid other deductions, this paper

concentrates

on the provisions that would affect taxes on income from capital.

Section 3 outlines the seven major provisions investigated here,
including: 1) the reduction of the corporate rate from 46 to 33 percent,

2) the reduction of personal rates to three brackets of 15, 25, and 35

percent, 3) the elimination of the 60 percent capital gains exclusion
and indexation of basis, 4) the 50 percent dividend deduction, 5) the
indexation of interest, 6) the repeal of investment tax credits, and 7)
the indexation of allowances for economic depreciation.

For current law, the results in Section 4 may be summarized under

three main points.

First, the marginal effective total tax rate is

percent, lower than previous estimates for the corporate

sector alone, and much lower than the

70 percent average effective

total tax rate found by Feldstein, Dicks—Mireaux, and Foterba (1983)
Second, the corporate tax is found to add nothing to the overall rate on

marginal investment, because the expected tax is completely offset by

credits, allowances, and interest deductions.

It does not collect

revenue from these marginal investments but still distorts their
allocation.

Third, as inflaton increases, some effective rates rise

because of historical cost depreciation and others fall because the
corporate rate for nominal

interest

deductions exceeds the personal rate

for nominal interest receipts. Overall, taxes fall with inflation, in
contrast to results of Feldstein and Summers (1979).

Three points also may be made about the Treasury proposal. First,
under almost any set of assumptions, the corporate tax would re—emerge

and thus raise effective tax rates.

Second, however, the plan would

significantly level the tax treatment of different assets.

It would

eliminate subsidies to equipment and debt financed investment, and it

would reduce the currently high rates -on nondepreciable assets and
equity financed investments.

Third, the Treasury plan would virtually

eliminate the dependence of effective tax rates on inflation.

Effective rates in the corporate sector are

not as high as under the Treasury plan, so intersectoral distortions
might be less. The White House plan also eliminates most of the current
dependence on inflation.

concentrate

on real investment.

Firm

arbitrage is the standard

assumption, because it is consistent with the segmented equilibrium

suggested by Miller (1977). That is, the returns to the firm are
equalized by arbitrage, and the net returns to debt and equity need not

be equalized if they are held by individuals in different brackets. The

importance of this choice is investigated by showing results for the
alternative assumption of individual arbitrage.

3. Data and Parameters for the U.S.

This section describes the assignment of values to each of the
parameters defined above. For convenience, it starts with capital stock

shares, financing shares, and property tax rates. Other parameters and

features of the tax code are described later in seven subsections:
corporate tax rates, personal tax rates, capital gains, dividends,
interest indexing, investment tax credits, and depreciation.

Because

these seven areas correspond to major components of either reform,
current law and proposed changes can be described in each subsection.

First, the stock of each asset used in each industry is derived
from Dale Jorgenson's unpublished estimates.7 These 1977 capital stocks

7See Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981) arid Fraumeni and Jorgenson (1980) for
more detail on the procedures used to make these estimates.

—13—

are aggregated to

18

industries and converted from levels to shares.

Rental and owner-occupied housing estimates are derived from the
February 1981 Survey of Current Business.

Little is known about how firms decide to finance marginal
investments, but this study uses existing proportions. The market value
of outstanding debt and equity are estimated from COMFtJSTAT tapes, and

annual retentions and new share issues are taken from the Flow of
Funds.8 These data indicate that corporations finance 33.7 percent by
debt,

61.4 percent by retentions, and 4.9 percent by new shares.

Section 4 shows the sensitivity of results to this assumption.

Even less is known about the financing of noncorporate business,
but the July 1982 Survey of Current Business indicates that the ratio of

interest payments to an estimate of capital income in the noncorporate
sector is almost identical to the same ratio in the corporate sector. A
rough estimate, then, is that noncorporate firms also finance a third of
their investments by debt and two-thirds by equity.

New homes are heavily mortgaged, but the loan to value ratio
typically falls as the house ages.

This study considers a permanent

increase in the capital stock, with fixed sources of finance, so a
permanent fraction for debt finance is approximated by total mortgage
debt as a fraction of total market value. Unpublished estimates of the
Census Bureau suggest that thié ratio is again very close to one-third.

The use of identical shares for debt in all three sectors will also
serve to isolate and highlight the tax differences among them.

8More detail on these procedures is provided on page 238 of King and
Fullerton (1984).

—14--

Finally, before turning to the seven areas that would be affected

by the proposals, consider the property tax on marginal investment.
This tax is collected by over a thousand local taxing jurisdictions, so

it is difficult to set these tax parameters by looking at the code.
Some jurisdictions may offer special rebates or tax holidays for new
business, but again the appropriate concept is the tax over the life of
the asset. Assuming that new investments will pay the same property tax

on average as existing investments, tax data from the Advisory
Commission on Intergovernmental Relations and Jorgensonts capital stocks

indicate rates of

.00768 for equipment.and inventories,

.01126 for

business land and structures, .01550 for public utilities, and .01837
for residential land and structures.

3.1 Corporate Tax Rates

The top federal statutory rate of

is used for marginal

corporate income, since most all of the corporate capital is held by
firms in this bracket.

The weighted average of states top—bracket

rates is .0655, including zeros for states without corporate taxes, and

using personal income to weight the fifty states.9

Accounting for the

deductibility of state taxes' at the federal level, the appropriate value

for u is .46+.0655(1—.46), which equals 49.5 percent.
The Treasury and White House proposals would set a single federal

3.2 Personal Tax Rates
The marginal investment under consideration is an equiproportionate

increase in all capital stocks, with an equiproportionate increase in
the holdings of all investors. Additional debt and interest income, for

example, would be distributed among debtholders in proportion to their
current debt and interest income. The appropriate marginal tax rate is
thus the average of all debtholders' marginal rates, weighted by their
interest income.

For households, these tax rates were calculated from the TAXSIM
model of the National Bureau of Economic Research.1° Marginal rates for

25,000 households are weighted by each different source of income and

shown in Table 1.

Rates under the current law in the first column

indicate that interest recipients are in relatively higher brackets than

wage—earners, while dividend recipients are in higher brackets still.
The

26

percent capital gains rate reflects the full taxation of

realized gains, and the 19.5 percent noncorporate rate reflects the

low brackets of many proprietors and partners with losses for tax
purposes.

All of these personal tax rates would be reduced by the

Treasury proposal, as shown in the second column. Since that plan would

reduce the top rate bracket proportionately more than other brackets,
however, it reduces the weighted average rate on dividends and capital

gains proportionately more than the rates on other forms of income.

101 am grateful to Lawrence Lindsey for performing all TAXSIM
calculations. See Lindsey and Navratil (1985) for further description
of this model.

— 16—

TAXSIM calculations are not yet available for the White House plan, but
the three brackets are very close to those of the Treasury plan.

Federal taxes are not the only personal taxes, and households are

not the only recipients of these income types.

In order to include

state income taxes, 5 percentage points are added to each federal rate

of the first column) This percentage reflects the weighted average of
the different states' rates, and the deductibility of state taxes at the

federal level for those who itemize. Six percentage points are added to
the rates in the second column, to reflect the fact that both proposals
would do away with this deductibility.

The personal rate on interest is then adjusted to account for the
taxation of banks, as described in King arid Fullerton (1984, pages 223-

case of firm arbitrage, where a larger dividend means that the recipient

earns a higher return.

1n equation (9) for individual arbitrage, it

means that the firm does not need to earn as much to provide the
required after—tax return to the saver.

3.5 Interest Indexing

Nominal interest income currently is taxed in the U.S., arid so

is set to one.

In

f

the world has very little experience with

—19—

attempts to index income, especially interest income.

Because the

Treasury would undertake several other types of indexing, however, it
may be important to deal with the indexation of interest as well.

Tax

shelters could become even more profitable if high-bracket individuals
were able to deduct nominal interest payments while being taxed only on
the real part of their income from other investments.

The Treasury recognizes the administrative difficulties of trying
to measure real interest income or expense, arid so it suggests a more

practical procedure that is intended to have approximately the same
effect. By knowing the inflation rate ir,

and assuming a 6 percent

real return at the outset, it can estimate the inflationary portion of
the nominal interest by 7r/(.06+lr).

Incentive effects of this system include the real effects of the
approximation used by the Treasury.

To separate the effects of this

approximation from the effects of interest indexing alone, calculations

are also performed for a more conceptually "pure" version of interest
indexing. Mortgage interest is left fully deductible, but equations (5)

through (11) are rewritten such that exactly

incentive for businesses to shift away from the otherwise efficient mix

ten percent credit for other equipment, a ten percent credit for public
utility structures, and

no credit for buildings, inventories, or land.

Both the Treasury and the White House plan would repeal these credits.

3.7 Depreciation

Great potential for noneutrailties arise because different assets
depreciate at many different rates, while tax codes tend to simplify by

grouping assets into few categories for depreciation allowances.

In

order to capture these nonneutralities, it is important to include many
diverse assets in

150 percent of declining balance with a switch at the optimal time to

tax credit. Other structures receive allowances based on 175 percent
of

declining

balance with an optimal switch to straight line.

These allowances are high relative to economic depreciation, but
they are fixed in nominal terms.

At moderate inflation rates, their

real present value may be less than that of economic depreciation. The
use of a nominal discount rate accounts for the fact that allowances are

based on historical cost. The calculation of z also accounts for the
half—year convention, annual allowances, arid continuous discounting.1

The Treasury proposes to

set

3

allowances as closely as possible to

estimates of economic depreciation, indexed for inflation. In fact, for

their Real Cost Recovery System (RCRS), they uses the Hulten—Wykoff
estimates to group together similar assets into seven classes.

Each

class has an exponential rate for allowances, and a year in which all

remaining basis may be deducted.

A real discount rate is used to

capture the indexing of allowances.14

13The exact formula for z

is shown in King and Fullerton (1984, page
211) .
Analogous formulae are used for the Real Cost Recovery System and

4. Results

In the first subsection below, one set of assumptions i.e used

to

provide detailed results for the 36 assets in the model, and for 18
private industries.

In order to see the impact and importance of

indexing interest, depreciation, and capital gains, each of seven
components are introduced one at a time and investigated separately.
Later subsections show the sensItivity of results to assumptions about

arbitrage, the net rate of return, the inflation rate, and financing
proportions.

are available for each special case,

but later tables save space by aggregating the results separately over

the 20 kinds of equipment, the 5 public utility structures, and the

structures.

—23—

4.1 Detailed Results for the Standard Assumptions
The fourth column of Table 2 shows current marginal effective total

tax rates in the corporate sector for each asset, including corporate
taxes, personal taxes, and property taxes. These rates are negative for
all

20

types of equipment, because the expected tax on the future

income from a marginal investment is more than offset by the combination

of investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation allowances, and
interest deductions. These credits and deductions are taken against the

tax that the corporation would otherwise have to pay on its previous
investments.

Assuming that the firm has sufficient tax liability to

make use of these benefits, the subsidy at the corporate level is in
fact large enough to offset the personal and property taxes as well as
corporate taxes.

Structures have rates between

25

and

45

percent, while

inventories and land are taxed at 42 and 45 percent, respectively.
The property tax represents the only difference between these last two
assets, but note that interest deductions still reduce their effective
rates well below the combination of statutory tax rates.

The fifth column of Table 2 indicates that the Treasury proposal

would indeed measure and tax economic income, subject to the caveats

mentioned in the previous section.

With economic depreciation

allowances and repeal of differential investment tax credits, equipment
would be taxed at levels close to those of structures, inventories, and
land.

Misailocations

among these assets would diminish accordingly.

credits

The repeal of investment tax

insures positive rates on all assets, however.

Using these rates for the 36 assets and weighting by the stock of

asset employed in each industry, Table 3 provides an estimate of
the marginal effective total tax rate in each of 18 private industries.
The low rate in services reflects the high weight on equipment and on

the

noncorporate sector, while the low rate in real estate reflects the

average of owner—occupied housing and noncorporate rental housing. All

industriest rates would be increased by. the Treasury plan, and most

would be increased by the White House plan, but the reasons are best
explained by looking at component parts.

4.2 Components of the Treasury Proposal

As a basis of comparison, results for current law are summarized in

the first column of Table 4, where the assets are aggregated separately
for equipment, structures, public utilities, inventories, and land. The

corporate sector rates reflect those in Table 2, where equipment was
subsidized and other assets were differentially taxed.
31.1

The overall

percent rate in the oorporate sector is not much different from

the 30.7 percent rate in the noncorporate sector, because the high
statutory corporate rate works two ways:

it is used to tax the income

from equity financed investments, but to deduct nominal interest on debt
financed investment.

The 17.2 percent rate on owner—occupied housing reflects only the
state and local property taxes, reduced to the degree that these taxes

—25--

are deducted at the federal level. Also, homeowners deduct interest at

a 30 percent rate, while the average interest recipient is taxed at a
marginal rate of 23 percent. All sectors are averaged together to get

the 263 percent overall rate.
The effect of interest indexing

by

itself can be seen in the second

column, where subsidies to equipment are removed and corporate taxes
generally are increased. Noncorporate rates change little, because the
24.5 percent rate for proprietors' interest deductions is very close to

the 23 percent rate on interest receipts.

Only the owner—occupant is

still allowed to deduct nominal interest payments, so the total rate in

this sector falls from 17 to 15 percent.
One interesting effect of this reform is demonstrated by the value
of

i shown in the bottom row o.f Table 4.

Under current law, with 4

percent inflation, the nominal interest rate must be 13.16 percent in

order for investors to pay tax on nominal interest and still receive
their fixed 5 percent real net return. When investors are taxed on a
fraction f of nominal interest, a fraction designed to approximate the

real component, the nominal rate only needs to be

11.58 percent to

provide the same real net return.16

The Treasury Department's approximation formula recognizes the
difficulty of trying to measure and

real interest income, but the

26—

third

column of this table shows the results of the more conceptual

e:perirnent of pure" interest indexing. Effective tax rates are in fact

very close to those of Treasury's approximation, but the real interest
rate in

this

model

is

not far from the

6

percent rate assumed

by

Treasury. In other experiments, the inflation rate was varied from zero
to 10 percent. Effective tax rates all start out at the same place, but

those for Treasury indexing increase about twice as fast as those for
pure indexing (while both types increase relative to current law with
its nominal interest deductions).

The biggest single step that could be taken toward leveling diverse

effective tax rates would be the repeal of the investment tax credit

that applies to equipment and public utility structures only.

The

fourth column of Table 4 shows this component by itself, where rates for

equipment rise from —.183 to 4.361, and the overall corporate sector
rate rises from

.311

to

.400.

The results of this study could be

used to construct for each tax regime a general equilibrium measure of
the

welfare

cost from misallocation of capital, along the lines of

Harberger (1966) .

repeal, intertemporal distortions may offset interasset welfare gains.

—27—

The next component would fully tax all realized capital gains but
index the basis for inflation.

This model does not capture potential

for increased retentions, realizations, tax certainty, or horizontal
equity.

It does capture the reduced dependence of taxes on inflation,

as shown below.

Effective tax rates in the fifth column are slightly

lower than those of the current law, indicating the important result
that indexing is slightly more valuable to taxpayers than the loss of

their 60 percent exclusion, even at only 4

percent inflation. As

seen for the White House plan below, investors choose indexing over the

exclusion when the inflation rate reaches 4 percent.

The 50 percent dividend deduction in the sixth column shows very
little reduction of tax rates (and only in the corporate sector) .

The

10 percent dividend deduction would change rates even less. The effect

of this deduction is limited to the total tax on new share issues,
however, a small 5 percent fraction of total corporate financing. The

dividend deduction might provide a substantial benefit to existing

retentions within the firm, but it does not apply to a marginal
investment financed by retained earnings: the rate of return to
shareholders in this case involves taking the later dividends relative

to the currently forgone dividends, and the deduction would apply
equally to both.18

The dividend deduction might encourage firms to

change their financing shares, however, as discussed below.

The reduction of the corporate rate from 46 to 33 percent also
would have little effect on tax rates, as shown in the seventh column of

being less than one as in
q
Auerbach (1979), Bradford (1981), and King (1977).
18This argument does not depend upon

Finally,

19

the reduction of personal tax rates would reduce

marginal effective total tax rates by a couple of percentage points in
both the corporate and noncorporate sectors. The nearly unchanged rate

for owner-occupants in the eighth column of Table 4 does not include
their loss of property tax deductibility.

In broader perspective, the effect of each component depends on
whether it is introduced by itself, as shown here, or in combination
with other components. As expected, some components by themselves would

raise effective tax rates while others would reduce them. At least for

this model with the standard set of parameters, however, the tax—
increasing effects are relatively large for interest indexing arid

of investment tax credits. Tax—reducing effects are small for capital

gains changes and

the

corporate rate reduction.

negative, but the division by p changes the sign of the effective tax
rate and makes it difficult to interpret at best. These depreciation
rules may work well with other components of the two tax plans, but they
enlarge the subsidy for some equipment when combined with the current
investment tax credits and nominal interest deductions.

33.5 percent.

The owner—occupied housing rate increases from 17 to

22 percent with the loss of property tax deductibility; the weighted
standard deviation of pretax returns falls from .0171 to .0117.

Corporate sector rates are raised by the White House plan with
these assumptions, but they are still lower than for the Treasury plan.

Interasset differences are greater than under the Treasury, but inter—
sectoral differences are less. The latter effect seems to dominate, as
the weighted standard deviation falls to .0093.

Results for individual arbitrage are shown in the next three
columns.

With this assumption under current law, effective tax rate

estimates are higher for all assets in such a way that disparites remain

but equipment is no longer subsidized.

However, the more uniform

treatment of different investors under the Treasury and White House

plans means that estimates of effective tax rates are much less
sensitive to this change of assumption.

Still the Treasury plan is

found to increase marginal effective total tax rates? from 38 to 44
percent in the corporate sector and from 30 to 34 percent overall.
With this assumption, however, the White House plan would reduce

the current rate in the corporate sector from

38

to

36

percent.

-30This

plan might therefore increase or decrease effective rates,

depending on assumptions.
The

assumption of a 5

percent net return is tested in the last

three columns, for the case of firm arbitrage.

return instead, current rates vary from —59 percent for equipment to

Figure 1.

When indexation of interest, depreciation and capital gains

are combined with the other features of the Treasury proposal, Figure 2

shows that inflation has virtually no remaining effect.

It reduces

taxes on owner—occupied housing because of nominal mortgage interest
deductions, but property taxes represent the major remaining difference
among corporate assets.

The White House plan would drop interest indexing, but Figure 3
shows that this feature is less important when the corporate rate is
reduced to a level more similar to the rate at which nominal interest
receipts are taxed. Effective rates only fall slightly with inflation.
Figure 3 also shows how CCRS retains some corporate asset differences.

4.4 Other Special Cases

If individuals and firms are mobile and fully informed, then the
Tiebout (1956) Hypothesis would suggest that the property tax is not a
distorting tax at all but a voluntary payment for local public services.

Effective tax rates for the three sectors and for the whole economy are

shown

for the standard parameters in

the first panel of Table 6 and for

the case with no property tax in the second panel. These calculations
indicate that property taxes make a big difference, constituting most of

the total tax rate under current law and the White House proposal, and
almost half of the total tax rate under the Treasury plan.

Property taxes represent the only tax on owner-occupied housing, a

sector which makes up one—third of the total capital stock.

Without

them, owner-occupied housing is subsidized by the fact that the

—32---

homeownerst

rate

for interest deductions exceeds the personal rate on

interest receipts.

If the property tax is not distorting, then the

total tax on combined income from capital in the United States is only
nine percent of the pretax return.

Many investments that qualify for credits and deductions are under—

taken by start—up firms that have not yet turned a profit, or by older
firms

with

indefinite loss positions.

For the extreme case where

credits are never used and income from the investment is never taxed,

effective rates are shown in the third panel of Table 6.

These

calculations also represent the effects of corporate tax repeal (without

trying to tax corporate income at the personal level). The current rate
in the corporate sector is only slightly reduced from the standard case,

indicating that the corporate tax is completely offset by credits,

allowances, and nominal interest deductions.22

It may distort

allocation without collecting any revenue from the marginal investment.
Under the Treasury and White House plans, the corporate tax does collect

revenue at the margin.

Changes in the other sectors are caused by

changes in the nominal interest rate.

Finally, Stiglitz (1973) has suggested that investments can be
totally debt financed at the margin.

This case is presented in the

fourth panel of Table 6, where the entire corporate sector is now
subsidized at a

equity, because the corporate rate reduction and dividend deduction more
than compensate f or the loss of investment tax credits.

Under current law, the tax on equity (.553) is clearly greater than

the tax on debt (-.275).

The Treasury plan would reduce this disparity

most, raising the tax on debt (to .306) and reducing the tax on equity

(to .491).

It would reduce distortions in financial decisions

accordingly.

Corporations might shift toward greater use of equity

finance, but they would not reduce their taxes in doing

so.

Under the

Treasury plan with 10 percent less debt and 10 percent greater new
share issues, the total rate on new investment in the corporate sector

increases from 43.1 percent to 44.6 percent.

5. Conclusion

Despite much recent interest in a consumption tax, the Treasury

Department's November 1984 tax plan proposes to adopt carefully
coordinated features of a more comprehensive income tax, including the

indexation of interest, depreciation, and capital gains.

President

Reagan's plan is similar, but it would re—accelerate depreciation
allowances and drop the indexation of interest. This paper looks at the
incentives under alternative tax regimes to make marginal investments in

the corporate sector, noncorporate sector, and in owner—occupied

—34--

housing. It

finds that the current system is characterized by effective

tax rates that increase with inflation for some assets and

decrease

with

inflation for other assets. Overall rates fall with inflation, and the

corporate tax is completely offset by credits, allowances, and
deductions.

Under the Treasury plan, the corporate tax re—emerges,

effective tax rates are considerably more uniform, and the interference

of inflation is virtually eliminated.
