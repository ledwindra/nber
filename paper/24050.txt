ABSTRACT
Policy discussions on financial market regulation tend to assume that whenever a corrective
policy is used ex post to ameliorate the effects of a crisis, there are negative side effects in terms
of moral hazard ex ante. This paper shows that this is not a general theoretical prediction,
focusing on the case of monetary policy interventions ex post. In particular, we show that if the
central bank does not intervene by monetary easing following a crisis, this creates an aggregate
demand externality that makes borrowing ex ante inefficient. If instead the central bank follows
the optimal discretionary policy and intervenes to stabilize asset prices and real activity, we show
examples in which the aggregate demand externality disappears, reducing the need for ex ante
intervention.

Introduction

Many economists and commentators have remarked that the conduct of interest policy by
the central bank can affect the incentives of the financial sector. In particular, a common
complaint is that the so called “Greenspan put”encourages excessive leverage and risk
taking by banks. The argument goes as follows. Suppose that when an adverse shock
drives down asset prices the central bank intervenes systematically by lowering interest
rates. This becomes an implicit commitment to prop up asset prices in times of distress
and encourages banks and other financial players to borrow more and take on more risk
ex ante. In turns, this increases the risk of systemic crises, with possible harmful repercussions on aggregate activity. Therefore, countercyclical interest rate policy may end up
increasing, rather than reducing macroeconomic volatility. Countercyclical monetary policy generates a form of moral hazard, where financial firms do not receive help directly,
but are subsidized indirectly by the central bank’s low interest rate policy.
A number of recent papers have formalized this idea in different ways, including
Lorenzoni (2001), Diamond and Rajan (2012), Farhi and Tirole (2012), and Chari and
Kehoe (2016). This paper attacks the problem from a different perspective. While the
existing literature emphasizes the distortionary role of an overly active monetary policy,
here we emphasize the distortions that arise when monetary policy is too passive. In other
words, we show that the lack of countercyclical interventions, in the face of negative aggregate shocks, can also worsen the problem of excessive leverage in the financial sector.
While the existing literature emphasizes a form of pecuniary externality, which travels
through asset prices, this paper emphasizes the presence of an aggregate demand externality, which travels through the level of real output. In this respect, our model builds
on the recent literature on macroprudential policy and aggregate demand externalities
started by Farhi and Werning (2016), Korinek and Simsek (2016), and Schmitt-Grohé and
Uribe (2106).
We present first a simple example in which a countercyclical interest rate policy can
completely eliminate the overborrowing distortion. We consider first a monetary policy
regime in which the interest rate is completely unresponsive to real activity and asset
prices. In that regime, the equilibrium is constrained inefficient and there is overborrowing. We then show that in our example the interest rate policy can be designed so
as to completely eliminate both output volatility and asset price volatility. Such a policy
does indeed induce higher borrowing ex ante. However, under this interest rate policy
the overborrowing problem disappears. So even though the level of borrowing goes up,
the distance between the lassez faire level of borrowing and the socially (constrained)

2

efficient level goes down.
Two closely related papers are Benigno et al. (2013) and Korinek and Jeanne (2016),
who analyze the relative benefits of ex ante and ex post policies to deal with financial
instability in different models.
Korinek and Jeanne (2016) look at a model in which the ex post policy is a form of
bailout in which resources are transferred from lenders to borrowers. Proposition 6 in
their papers shows that when more resources are available for an ex post bailout, this can
reduce the need for ex ante macroprudential policy, that is ex ante and ex post policies
can be substitutes rather than complements. That result is close in spirit to the message
of this paper. However, their model is a purely real model with an exogenous interest
rate pinned down by a storage technology, while here we focus on the use of interest rate
policy as a tool to stabilize asset prices and deal with a crisis ex post.
Benigno et al. (2013) is closer to our model, in that the ex post intervention is also
captured by monetary policy.1 There are two main differences with our paper. First, our
paper features an explicit role for asset prices, and thus can be used to discuss asset price
stabilization by the central bank. Second, our paper focuses on a simple model where
analytic results can be derived. In particular, we focus on understanding whether monetary tools and macroprudential tools are substitutes or complements, provide numerical
examples of both cases, and show how the interplay of pecuniary externalities and aggregate demand externalities leads to one case or the other. An additional novelty of this
paper, is the extension of the analysis to unconventional monetary policy in Section 6.
Finally, our paper is related to a classic debate on the benefits of asset price stabilization as a monetary policy objective. Bernanke and Gertler (1999) made the point that
monetary policy should respond to asset price movements insofar as they affect aggregate demand. In this paper, we look indeed at monetary responses to asset prices that
are motivated by aggregate demand management, and ask the question whether these
responses ex post encourage instability and excess leverage ex ante.

The model

Consider a three period economy, with t = 0, 1, 2. In periods 0 and 2 the economy is an
endowment economy. In period 1 output is produced with a linear technology that uses
only labor.
There are two groups of agents of equal size, labeled A and B. The preferences of

where ctB denotes consumption and 0 < β < 1. The assumption of linear utility for both
agents in period 0 simplifies the welfare analysis, by making utility transferable ex ante.
Both agents receive a large endowment of the single consumption good in period 0. In
period 1, agent A receives labor income by supplying labor on a competitive labor market
at the wage rate w1 .
There is a discrete set of states of the world s ∈ S, with probability distribution π (s).
The state s is revealed in period 1. There is a risky asset in fixed supply in the economy, which pays δ1 (s) units of consumption good in period 1 and δ2 (s) units in period
2. The risky asset can only be held by B agents. In periods 0 and 1, agents trade a real
non-state contingent bond that pays 1 unit of consumption goods in the following period.
Assuming that only B agents can hold the risky asset and that they are more impatient
than A agents is a simple way of obtaining levered agents, whose balance sheets are exposed to shocks and affect aggregate spending in the economy. The channels captured in
this simple model can be extended to richer models of borrowing and lending as, for example, models with levered intermediaries exposed to aggregate risk who make lending
decisions that affect aggregate spending.
In period 1, there is a continuum of monopolistic firms on the interval [0, 1] that produce intermediate goods. Each intermediate good is produced with a linear technology
that uses only labor x j = n j1 . The goods are then combined to produce the final consumption good using the production function

Y. In the
expressions above m1 = is the nominal stochastic discount factor of A agents, w1 is the
nominal wage in period 1, and σ is a subsidy on the production of intermediate goods. We
assume the government finances the subsidy σ by levying a lump-sum tax on A agents,
so that the real income of A agents in period 1 is simply Y. We introduce the subsidy to
give the government a tool to correct for the monopolistic distortion.
Policy is captured by three instruments. The nominal interest rate it , set by the central
bank in periods 0 and 1. The subsidy σ introduced above. And a macroprudential linear
tax τ on borrowing at t = 0. The tax revenues from the macroprudential tax are rebated
as a lump sum transfer to the B agents, who pay the tax. Our assumptions on how the
subsidy σ and the tax τ are financed imply that all interventions are wealth neutral, so we
do not allow the government to directly reallocate resources across agents.

Equilibrium under different monetary regimes

Our goal is to study the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential policy.
In this section, we start by characterizing the equilibrium under three different monetary
policy regimes, setting the macroprudential tax to zero. In the next sections, we investigate the benefits of adding macroprudential policy under different monetary regimes.

3.1

Preliminary steps

Before introducing the different regimes, we need a few preliminary steps that characterize equilibrium allocations independently of the regime.
All price setters face the same strictly concave problem, so they all choose the same
nominal price p j1 = p1 and they all produce the same amount of goods Y with the same
amount of labor n = Y. Since prices are set one period in advance, monetary policy can

r ≡ (1 + i1 )

p1
− 1.
p2

We can then focus on characterizing the equilibrium allocations that can be achieved by a
social planner who chooses r at date 1 and the subsidy σ at date 0.
To characterize the equilibrium, we go backwards in time and solve first for the equilibrium at dates t = 1, 2. In this way, we obtain the output level Y that arises in period 1,
in state s, when agents A hold D units of real debt issued by B agents and the real interest
rate is r. We use the function Y ( D, r, s) to denote this output level and leave its explicit
derivation to Appendix 8.1.
We now introduce two value functions which will be useful in the rest of the analysis.
Let V A (b, D, r, s) denote the expected utility in state s of an agent A who enters period 1
with b units of bonds in an economy in which all other A agents hold D units of bonds,
all other B agents have D units of debt, and the real interest rate is r. Let V B (d, D, r, s)
denote the analogous value for the B agents, with d denoting the individual level of debt.
In equilibrium we have b = d = D, but for the analysis it is convenient to separate
individual decisions from aggregates. The formal definitions of V A and V B are:
V A (b, D, r, s) = maxc A ,c A u(c1A ) − v (Y ( D, r, s)) + u(c2A )

The equations above show that the expected utility of the two agents depend on three
key variables: the individual financial positions, the aggregate level of debt in the economy, and the real interest rate. The following lemma characterizes these relations. The

The values of c1A and c1B in the expressions above are the values that solve the problems
in the value functions of A and B, at b = d = D; Y is short for Y ( D, r, s).
Let us provide intuition for the results in the lemma. The first two partial derivatives
in Lemma 1 are completely standard and capture the private marginal benefit of lending
for agent A and the private marginal cost of borrowing for agent B.
The derivative VDA captures an aggregate demand externality that plays a crucial role
in the rest of the analysis. The effect of debt on output is captured by the derivative
∂Y/∂D. This derivative is negative because a debt payment is a transfer of resources
from B agents to A agents, and the former have a higher propensity to consume, due to
higher impatience.3 In this way, the model captures in a nutshell the real effects of debt
overhang. A marginal change in output increases or decreases welfare depending on the
sign of u0 (c1A ) − v0 (Y ). With flexible prices—after removing the monopolistic distortion—
this difference would always be zero. But in a new Keynesian environment this term
can be non zero. In particular, when it is positive, increasing output and hours worked
yields marginal benefits greater than marginal costs. This is the efficiency loss typically
associated to the notion of “output gap.” We call u0 (c1A ) − v0 (Y ) the labor wedge and use
interchangeably the language “the labor wedge is positive/negative” and “the output
gap is positive/negative.”4 When there is a positive output gap, a higher level of debt is
welfare reducing as it reduces output at a point where output increases would be welfare
improving.
The next derivative, VDB , is zero because the B agents’ decision problem is not directly

we are thinking of the welfare benefits of producing more goods and assigning them to agent A.
Given that there are two agents and imperfect insurance, the notion would be different if we looked at the
welfare benefits of assigning the extra goods to agent B. This would change slightly the decomposition and
interpretation of our two main forces, but it would change nothing in the substance of the analysis.

affected by the level of Y.
Finally, the derivatives VrA and VrB describe how agents’ utilities depend on the real
interest rate. The real interest rate affects agents in two ways. First, increasing the interest
rate reallocates resources from borrowers to lenders, in proportion to the amount of borrowing and lending taking place between periods 1 and 2. Since in equilibrium agents
A save Y + D − c1A and this is equal to the amount borrowed by agents B, in this way
we obtain the first term in VrA and the only term in VrB . The real interest rate also affects
A agents through the aggregate demand channel. In particular, raising the interest rate
changes the equilibrium level of output according to ∂Y/∂r and this affects welfare in
proportion to the labor wedge.
To complete the equilibrium characterization, we need three additional steps: determine how monetary policy chooses r in each state of the world; determine the level of D
which arises in equilibrium at t = 0; ensure that the price setters’ optimality condition is
satisfied at t = 0. The solution of these steps depends on the monetary policy regime. In
the next section we consider three possible regimes and complete the equilibrium characterization.

3.2

Inertial regime

To define our first two regimes, we assume that policy is set by a planner who maximizes
the social welfare function
h
i
W = E V A ( D, D, r, s) + βV B ( D, D, r, s) ,

(3)

with side transfers taking place at date 0 to reallocate utility between A and B agents.5
In the first regime, the interest rate at t = 1 is set by the planner before the realization
of the state s. We think of this regime as capturing inertia in the response of the central
bank to information about aggregate shocks, so we call it the “inertial” regime.6
The timing is as follows. First, the equilibrium debt level d = b = D is determined in
the bond market at date 0.7 Next, at the beginning of period 1, before the realization of
the state s, the planner chooses a real interest rate r̄ to maximize (3). After the realization
5 The

presence of heterogeneous discount factors introduces a source of time inconsistency in optimal
policy. By focusing on the welfare function (3) we leave aside that source of time inconsistency. Other
interesting sources are present, as we shall see.
6 An alternative source of real interest rate rigidity that would lead to related results would be to consider
an open economy with a fixed exchange rate regime or a monetary union.
7 Since prices are flexible in period 0 the central bank can choose the nominal interest rate i but has no
0
power to affect the real interest rate between dates 0 and 1, (1 + i0 ) p0 /p1 , which is determined at the level
that clears the bond market.

of s, the central bank cannot revisit its choice of the interest rate. Agents choose their
spending in period 1 and that determines output. Finally, in period 2, agents consume
their endowment net of their final bonds positions. The subsidy σ is set to ensure that the
price setting condition of the producers at t = 0 is satisfied.8
The crucial restriction in this regime is that the central bank cannot use the interest
rate policy to mitigate the drop in the asset price Q for low realizations of δ. As we shall
see, this sluggish response of the central bank may reduce the incentive of B agents to
borrow in period 0 as they cannot rely on the implicit bailout coming from looser policy.
An equilibrium under this regime is given by a pair D, r̄ that satisfies the following
two conditions: (i) optimal monetary policy, characterized by the first-order condition
h
i
E VrA ( D, D, r̄, s) + βVrB ( D, D, r̄, s) = 0;

(4)

(ii) bond market equilibrium at date 0, characterized by the condition
h
i
h
i
E VbA ( D, D, r̄, s) + βE VdB ( D, D, r̄, s) = 0.

(5)

Since the central bank chooses the interest rate r̄ after the bonds market in period 0 has
cleared, the central bank takes D as given when choosing r̄. At the same time, consumers
do not internalize the effect that the equilibrium level of D has on the central bank’s choice
of r̄, simply because they are atomistic. This explains why strategic considerations do not
appear in conditions (4) and (5).
Using Lemma 1, condition (4) can be rewritten as

This condition shows that the central bank is balancing two effects when choosing the
interest rate. The first is a standard new Keynesian effect: changing the interest rate
affects equilibrium output and this increases or decreases welfare depending on the sign

of the output gap. The second effect is a pecuniary externality associated to incomplete
markets: changing the interest rate reallocates resources from borrowers to lenders and if
the marginal utilities of borrowers and lenders are different ex post this can have welfare
benefits. Davila and Korinek (2017) call this a distributive externality. Here, given that r is
not allowed to be state contingent, the monetary authority chooses a level of the interest
rate that balances these two welfare effects in expectation.
Using Lemma 1 we can also rewrite (5) as follows
Eu0 (c1A ) = βEu0 (c1B ),

(7)

which shows that the debt level is chosen to equalize expected marginal utilities.
Conditions (6) and (7) will be used to characterize the equilibrium in the inertial
regime in the rest of the paper.

3.3

Proactive regime

In our second regime, the planner also aims to maximize the social welfare function (3),
but can now choose a fully state contingent interest rate. The timing is as in the previous
regime, but r is set after observing s. We call this regime the proactive regime.
An equilibrium under this regime is given by a debt level D and interest rates {r (s)}s∈S
that satisfy the following two conditions: (i) optimal monetary policy, characterized by
the first-order condition
VrA ( D, D, r (s) , s) + βVrB ( D, D, r (s) , s) = 0 for all s ∈ S;

(ii) bond market equilibrium at date 0, characterized by the condition

As in the previous regime, Lemma 1 can be used to rewrite these conditions. In particular,
condition (6) now holds state by state and takes the form

(10)

Condition (9) can be written as (7), as in the inertial regime.
As in the previous regime, the subsidy σ is chosen to ensure that price-setters’ optimality is satisfied.

10

3.4

Output targeting regime

The third regime is one in which the planner responds to the state s, but its only objective
is to replicate the equilibrium that would arise under flexible prices and perfect competition (i.e., with no monopolistic distortion). So we are looking at a regime in which σ and
r (s) are set so that the following condition holds state by state
u0 (c1A ) − v0 (Y ) = 0.
We call this regime the output targeting regime, because it keeps the output gap at zero.
The ex ante optimality condition that ensures equilibrium in the debt market at t = 0 is
(7) as in the previous regimes.
The conditions just described, together with the conditions characterizing a continuation equilibrium, are sufficient to pin down the equilibrium allocation under this regime.
However, for the analysis to follow we need to be precise on the timing. We assume that
the central bank commits at t = 0 to set at t = 1 the real interest rate r (s) that implements
the flexible price allocation. Therefore this regime is different from the previous two not
only because of the planner’s objective, but also for its commitment to future interest
rates. As we shall see, this commitment assumption will deliver a clean characterization
of this regime in terms of macroprudential policy.

4

More borrowing, less overborrowing

We now turn to our main questions: How does the monetary regime affect the level of
borrowing? How does it affect the benefits of macroprudential intervention? In a simple
example with log preferences, the answers to these two questions go in opposite directions: the proactive regime yields more debt than the inertial regime, but the benefits of
macroprudential policy are larger in the inertial regime. This example makes the main
point of the paper. In this section, we present the log example and provide some intuition for it. In the next section, we go beyond the example to investigate more general
implications of our analysis.
Let us specialize our model by assuming log preferences, u (c) = log c, and no dividend at t = 1, δ1 (s) = 0. Consumption levels at t = 1 are now

The following proposition characterizes the equilibrium in the proactive regime, which,
in this case, is identical to the output targeting regime. The proof is in the appendix.
Proposition 1. With log preferences and δ1 = 0, the proactive regime and the output targeting
regime coincide and they are characterized by a real interest rate that exactly offsets changes in
δ2 , so the asset price δ2 /(1 + r ), output, and the consumption levels of both agents are constant
across states.
In this example, optimal discretionary monetary policy achieves perfect stabilization
of asset prices through interest rate policy—an especially stark example of the Greenspan
put at work. This policy is optimal because it achieves, at the same time, a zero output gap
and perfect insurance between agents, thus making both terms of (10) zero. The insurance
effect of the policy can be seen immediately from (11), that shows that the wealth of B
agents is perfectly stabilized by keeping δ2 /(1 + r ) constant.
Turning to the inertial regime, it is easy to see that we no longer obtain perfect insurance for B agents, as now the interest rate is constant and asset prices move with δ2 ,
making consumption more volatile. We can then ask whether this increased volatility induces B agents to be more cautious and borrow less ex ante. Substituting the consumption
values just derived, equation (7) takes the form


Since the utility function displays prudence, this equation suggests that higher volatility
of the asset price δ2 /(1 + r ) leads to increased savings, that is, less borrowing, by B agents.
This intuition is confirmed in the next proposition. To prove the proposition requires
some additional steps, because in the inertial regime the variable Y is also volatile, and not
only the volatility, but also the average levels of r and Y are different in the two regimes.
To deal with these complications, we restrict attention to the case of small shocks to δ2 .
The proof is in the appendix.
Proposition 2. With log preferences, δ1 = 0, and small shocks to δ2 , the proactive regime features
a higher level of borrowing D in equilibrium than the inertial regime.
12

This result seems to offer a perfect example of the evil incentive effects of the Greenspan
put. However, this is just a positive result about the levels of D in the two regimes, not
about their efficiency properties. The next proposition shows that looking at efficiency
leads to different conclusions.
To evaluate the benefits of macroprudential policy, we look at the effect of a marginal
change in D on welfare.
Proposition 3. With log preferences and δ1 = 0, in the inertial regime there is excessive borrowing ex ante, that is, social welfare is locally decreasing in D:
i

E V ( D, D, r̄, s) + βV B ( D, D, r̄, s) < 0.

E V ( D, D, r (s) , s) + βV ( D, D, r (s) , s) = 0.

In order to build intuition for this result, let us first provide some derivations that
characterize the marginal social benefit of a change in D. Using the results in Lemma 1
and the private optimality condition for debt (7), we can characterize the marginal effect
of debt on social welfare as follows.
Lemma 2. In all the monetary regimes considered, the marginal welfare effects of a change in D
is equal to

This result is independent of the functional form assumptions made for u and v, and
it does not rely on the special assumptions made in this section. Furthermore, it holds
in all the monetary regimes considered. One may wonder why there is no term capturing the fact that changing D ex ante will affect the choice of r ex post. In the first two
regimes, where monetary policy is chosen under discretion, this happens because the ex
post choice of r is optimal, so an envelope argument implies that this effect can be ignored. In the output targeting regime, this happens because the central bank commits to
r ex ante and does not change it off the equilibrium path if D is changed. This is where
the assumption of commitment in the third regime helps to simplify the analysis.
The effect of debt on output is given by

which is constant and independent of the state of the world. So we can focus on establishing the sign of the average labor wedge
i
h
E u0 (c1A ) − v0 (Y ) .
In the inertial regime, it is possible to show that the output gap is positive in low δ2
states and negative in high δ2 states. This is due to the fact that in that regime the risk δ2
is not insured and a reduction in δ2 reduces the wealth of the B agents who have a rel

atively larger marginal propensity to consume. Therefore the sign of E u0 (c1A ) − v0 (Y )
depends on whether the positive wedge in the bad states dominates the negative wedge
in the good states. In economic terms, a larger debt stock D worsens recessions in bad
states, which is bad for welfare, and dampens booms in good states, which is good for
welfare. The proof of Proposition 3 in the appendix shows that the first effect dominates,
so, overall, more borrowing reduces welfare.
In the proactive regime, we have already established that the output gap is always
zero. Therefore, there is no welfare gain from changing the level of borrowing ex ante, as
the level of output is already at its socially efficient level state by state.
Summing up, using interest rate policy to fight a recession leads to higher borrowing
ex ante, but this is not a symptom of inefficient borrowing ex ante. In fact, the presence
of optimal discretionary monetary policy ex post eliminates the distance between equilibrium borrowing and its socially efficient level, thus making macroprudential policy
unnecessary.
It is useful to connect our results here with results in Farhi and Werning (2016) and
Korinek and Simsek (2016) on macroprudential policy at the zero lower bound. So far we
have ignored the possibility of the zero lower bound binding, which is fine in our context
because the economy has flexible prices at t = 2 so the monetary authority can choose an
inflation rate between t = 1 and t = 2 to achieve any real interest rate desired. However, it
is easy to add an ad hoc form of ZLB by imposing r ≥ r. Consider now a central bank that
tries to achieve a zero output gap but is constrained by the ZLB. Then the output gap can
never be positive, as increasing rates is always possible. Therefore, if the ZLB is binding


with positive probability the expression E u0 (c1A ) − v0 n1A is positive and the aggregate
demand externality yields excessive borrowing in line with results in Farhi and Werning
(2016) and Korinek and Simsek (2016). Our results show that ex post monetary policy
inertia provides a rationale for macroprudential policy even if the ZLB is not binding. We
will return to the ZLB in Section 6.

Tradeoffs, complementarity and substitutability

In the previous section we established that, under certain assumptions, ex post monetary
intervention is a substitute for macroprudential policy: more intervention ex post reduces
the marginal benefit of macroprudential policy. In this section we move beyond the special assumptions of the previous section and ask more generally in what cases is ex post
monetary intervention a substitute for macroprudential policy and in what cases there
can be complementarity between the two policies.
In the analysis of the previous section, the proactive regime achieves the same allocation as the output targeting regime. As argued above, this happens because the proactive
regime is able to set both terms of (10) to zero at the same time. By choosing the state
contingent interest rate r the central bank can take care of both frictions present in our
environment: price rigidity and lack of insurance against δ shocks.
This is a knife-edge result that only holds with log utility. With log utility changing
the interest rate has no direct effect on the consumption decisions of A agents, as income
and substitution effects cancel each other. For B agents, the interest rate affects their
consumption decisions only by changing the discounted value of dividends in period
2. So, by moving interest rates proportionally to dividends, the central bank can reach
constant asset prices and constant ouptut without distorting the agents’ intertemporal
margin. This is no longer true when income and substitutions effect do not cancel each
other, i.e., when the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is different than 1.
Once we move away from log utility, the central bank faces a tradeoff when setting
interest rates and needs to balance a traditional macro objective—stabilizing aggregate
output—and a financial stability objective—using the interest rate to redistribute in favor
of B agents hit by a negative shock. In this section we want to investigate the role of
macroprudential policy when monetary policy has to deal with this tradeoff.
We will make our main points using numerical examples. Our main example uses the
parameters
β = 0.5, γ = 0.5, ψ = 1, φ = 1, δ1 = 0
and a binary distribution for the δ2 shock with values 1.05 and 1.5 that occur with equal
probabilities 1/2. The reason why we assume γ < 1, is that in this simple setup this
assumption ensures that in the output targeting regime or, equivalently, under flexible
prices, asset prices and the consumption of B agents are monotone increasing in δ2 . The
reason why we choose a low discount factor for B agents is to give them a strong incentive to borrow, so we can better visualize the potential inefficiencies associated to overborrowing. In the appendix, we show that the qualitative results identified here also hold

5.1

Output stability and financial stability

First, let us understand better the nature of the tradeoff faced by the monetary authority
ex post. To do so it is useful to concentrate on the equilibrium in the output targeting
regime, where, by definition, the first term in (10) is set to zero. Equilibrium in the bonds
market at t = 1 requires
h
i
E u0 (c1A ) − βu0 (c1B ) = 0.
As long as c1A and c1B are, respectively, monotone decreasing and monotone increasing in
δ2 , we have
u0 (c1A ) − βu0 (c1B ) < 0
in the low δ2 states and
u0 (c1A ) − βu0 (c1B ) > 0
in the high δ2 states. This means that, starting from pure output gap stabilization, the
central bank’s incentive is to further lower interest rates in the bad state and to further
increase them in the good state. That is, the central bank is driven to stabilize asset prices
over and above what is required to stabilize output. This happens because of the insurance motive: moving one dollar from lenders to borrowers in the bad state means
transferring it to agents with higher marginal utility. Reducing the interest rate achieves
this transfer.
In Table 1 we show how the interest rate r responds to δ in the output targeting regime
and in the proactive regime. In the second case, the central bank uses the interest rate
more aggressively in response to bad shocks.
Now we are in a situation in which the central bank is tempted to ease more—in a
recession caused by weak borrowers’ balance sheets—than what it would be warranted
under a pure output stabilization objective. In this situation, we ask again whether macroprudential policy may be of help.

16

5.2

An example of complementarity

As we did above, let us first focus on the marginal benefit of changing D starting from no
borrowing tax. Equation (12) continues to hold in this case. In the output targeting regime
it gives dW/dD = 0. So in that regime a macroprudential tax gives no welfare benefit. In
the proactive regime, on the other hand, this expression is in general different from zero
once γ 6=1. In the numerical example above the value of this expression is negative.
Turning to optimal policy, we illustrate graphically the optimal choice of macroprudential and monetary policy in Figure 1, where we plot the contours of the social welfare
function in the space spanned by the borrowing tax τ and the interest rate in the bad state,
denoted by r B . To represent the policy space in two dimensions, for each point (r B , τ ) we
set the interest rate in the good state, denoted by rG , as a linear function
r G = α0 + α1 r B ,
choosing α0 , α1 so that we go trough the pairs r B , rG corresponding to the output targeting
regime and to the proactive regime with an optimal macroprudential tax, depicted by the
two red points in the figure.
In the example considered here, monetary policy and macroprudential policy are complements, because, along the line that connects the two regimes considered, the cross
derivative ∂2 W/∂r B ∂τ is negative.9 That is, if we compare the output targeting regime to
the proactive regime the choice of a lower rate in the second regime increases the marginal
benefit of the borrowing tax. This leads to an optimal tax in the proactive regime that is
larger than the optimal tax in the output targeting regime (which is zero).
We derive two conclusions from this analysis. One is that once we move away from
the knife-edge of Section 4, optimal policy requires a combination of monetary tools and
macroprudential tools. So monetary policy is no longer a perfect substitute for macroprudential policy. The second conclusion is that we finally have a result more in line
with conventional wisdom on moral hazard effects. Comparing a regime of pure output
targeting to a fully discretionary regime, in the latter regime the central bank increases
its interest rate response, stabilizes asset prices more, and there is a stronger motive to
impose a borrowing tax ex ante.
Digging a bit more in the intuition, shows that this result relies on the central bank
exceeding its output objectives. In the bad state of the world the central bank is choosing

to overstimulate the economy, so we are reaching an allocation with u0 (c1A ) − v0 n1A < 0.
9 Complementarity/substitutability

is defined in this way in this policy space, because lowering the rate
more in the bad state is a more aggressive intervention.

Figure 1: Monetary policy, macroprudential tax and welfare: complementarity
In the good state of the world the opposite is true. Inducing agents to borrow less ex ante
leads to more output ex post. This is bad for welfare in the bad state of the world where
the economy is already overstimulated. But it is good in the good state of the world, in
which output is below potential. The latter effect dominates in our example, so overall a
borrowing tax is welfare improving. This explains why we get complementarity between
monetary policy and macroprudential policy in this example.

5.3

An example of substitutability

In Figure 1 we compared the proactive regime and the output targeting regime. What
happens when we compare them to the inertial regime with rigid interest rates? In that
regime, the sign of the macroprudential policy can be derived analytically, extending the
first part of Proposition 3.

Figure 2 illustrates this result using our numerical example. The figure is constructed
as Figure 1, but choosing the parameters α0 , α1 so as to go through the output targeting
regime and the inertial regime with an optimal macroprudential tax. As the figure shows,

Interest rate in the bad state (%)

Figure 2: Monetary policy, macroprudential tax and welfare: substitutability
in this region of the policy space monetary policy and macroprudential policy are substitutes. That is, along the line that connects the two regimes considered, the cross derivative
∂2 W/∂r B ∂τ is positive. As we compare the inertial regime to the output targeting regime,
a more aggressive reduction of the interest rate in the second regime leads to a lower
macroprudential tax.
To complete the analysis of our example, it remains to compare the two extreme
regimes, the inertial regime and the proactive regime. We know that in both regimes
the borrowing tax is positive. But in what regime is the tax larger? And in what regime
are the welfare benefits of the tax larger? In Table 2 we answer this questions in the context of our example. The table reports the value of the optimal tax, the difference between
D at τ = 0 and D at the optimal tax, and the welfare gain due to the introduction of
the optimal borrowing tax, in equivalent consumption terms. In the inertial regime all
these measures of overborrowing are larger than in the proactive regime. Therefore, over
the range of monetary policies that connect the two regimes, the forces of substitutability
dominate the forces of complementariety identified in the previous subsection, so a more
interventionist monetary policy ends up requiring less macroprudential intervention.
The table also shows how the results change when we choose a lower value of γ.
All measures of overborrowing are larger in this case, but the relative comparison of the
two regimes is qualitatively the same. In the appendix, we experiment with different
parameter combinations and our qualitative results do not seem to depend on the choice

of β, γ, ψ, and φ.
We can then give a more nuanced answer the question: does a more aggressive monetary regime increase or decrease the need for ex ante regulation? The answer turns out
to be sensitive not only to the parameters of the model but to the points we region of
the policy space we are analyzing. If we compare a monetary policy that does not respond at all to negative shocks to a more aggressive policy, the need for macroprudential
policy is lower, as the more aggressive monetary policy mitigates the aggregate demand
externality. If we compare a monetary policy that is already responding strongly enough
so as to eliminate the output gap to an even more aggressive policy, then the need for
macroprudential policy increases in the latter regime.
The conclusions above are of course partly driven by the special nature of our example. In all the numerical examples we have explored the benefit of macroprudential policy
are lower in the proactive regime as compared to the inertial regime, but we do not know
if that can be proved in general. The general message we can draw from these examples
is that moral hazard concerns should not be necessarily stronger in presence of a more
aggressive monetary policy, and that whether macroprudential policy needs to be tighter
or looser depends on where we are in the policy space.

5.4

Another example of substitutability

The examples considered so far shows that once the central bank goes over and above its
output stability objective to achieve a financial stability objective, this calls for a corrective
macroprudential tax ex ante. One may wonder whether this is a general result. We now
look at an example that shows that it is not. We maintain our benchmark parametrization
but no longer assume zero dividends in period 1. Instead we assume that the dividends
in the two periods are perfectly collinear
δ1 = ξδ2 ,

where ξ ≥ 0. We continue to assume δ2 has a binary distribution with values {1.05, 1.5}
and equal probabilities.
Figure 3 shows the optimal macroprudential tax in the proactive regime for different
levels of ξ. The output targeting regime features a zero tax, as in all previous examples.
When ξ = 0 we replicate the result in the proactive column of Table 2: the optimal tax
is 0.2%. However, as ξ increases the optimal tax is lower and when ξ is high enough the
optimal tax becomes a subsidy, so we have underborrowing in the proactive regime.
Recall the intuition for the complementarity result in Subsection 5.2. Optimal monetary policy generates a negative output gap in the bad state and a positive output gap
in the good state. Increasing debt ex ante improves welfare in the bad state and reduces
welfare in the good state. In the example of Subsection 5.2 the latter effect was larger. In
the example here, with ξ high enough, the first effect is larger, so subsidizing borrowing
is welfare improving. To get some intuition for why the magnitudes of the two effects are
flipped with high ξ, notice that when δ1 increases relative to δ2 it gets harder for monetary policy to provide insurance to the B agents, as their wealth becomes less sensitive to
r. This leads monetary policy in the bad state to lower rates more and produce a larger
negative output gap.

6

Unconventional monetary policy

So far we have focused on a monetary policy response that uses the traditional tool
of setting nominal interest rates. Recent experience has seen central banks use non21

conventional tools, such as asset purchases, to fight recessions, after nominal rates hit
the zero lower bound. In this section, we extend the model to ask how the use of nonconventional tools affects the message of the previous sections. We consider here a simple
variation on the case of log preferences and zero dividends at t = 1 studied in Section 4.
As argued at the end of that section, it is easy to add a ZLB constraint to the policy problem in the form
r ≥ r.
We will do so and explore what happens when the ZLB is binding and the central bank
is considering unconventional interventions. Our question is now: Do ex post unconventional interventions that prop up asset prices increase the need of ex ante macroprudential
policy? Before addressing that question, we need to characterize the equilibrium and introduce unconventional monetary policy.

6.1

Equilibrium with collateral constraints

Assume B agents are not allowed to pledge the entire future value of the asset when
they borrow in period t = 1, but only a fraction θ of it. This introduces a form of market
segmentation that will make unconventional interventions have some bite. Then we need
to rewrite the budget constraints of the B agents in periods 1 and 2 as follows
xQ + c1B ≤ Q − D + d1 ,
c2B ≤ δ2 x − (1 + r ) d1 ,
where Q denotes the asset price, x is the amount of the asset kept by B agents at the end
of period 1, and d1 is borrowing in period 1. The collateral constraint is

(1 + r ) d1 ≤ θδ2 x.
Here we allow the agent to sell some of the asset and keep x of it. We introduce this
possibility because we want to model unconventional monetary policy as asset purchases
by the central bank. In particular, we assume that the central bank raises a lump sum tax
T on A agents and uses it to purchase x G units of the asset, so
T = x G Q.

22

The asset then produces goods in the government sector according to the strictly concave

production function F x G , and these goods are paid to the A agents. The intertemporal
constraint of the A agents then takes the form
c1A +

 

c2 ≤ n1A + D − T +
F xG .

1+r

(13)

We assume F 0 (0) < δ2 for all realizations of δ2 , so it will be inefficient to purchase the asset
in normal circumstances. This policy features a tradeoff between increased purchases,
which push up asset prices and improve the balance sheet of B agents, and the inefficiency
cost of the government technology.10
We now want to characterize the optimization problem of the B agents, imposing equilibrium in the asset market for a given value of government purchases x G and a given
interest rate r. Two cases are possible. First, if the collateral constraint is not binding the
asset price is

Q=

(14)

So, as long as the B agents are solvent, meaning that their assets valued at the first best
price are sufficient to repay their debt D, there is always a value of x low enough that
ensures an unconstrained equilibrium. That is, given that x G = 1 − x, if the government
purchases enough of the asset at the first best price, the B agents are unconstrained.
The second case is when the collateral constraint is binding, which arises when inequality (14) is violated. With a binding collateral constraint the values of c1B , c2B and Q
must satisfy:
c1B = (1 − x ) Q +
10 This

is different from a policy that subsidizes directly asset prices. If such policy could be financed by
lump sum taxes on A agents, it would effectively transfer resources between the agents with no efficiency
cost, thus allowing the planner to reach the first best.

The first equation says that consumption in period 1 plus the debt payment D are financed
by selling some of the asset and borrowing up to the limit. The second equation has consumption in period 2 given by the dividends on the unsold asset minus the maximum
debt payment θδ2 x. The third equation shows that the asset price is a weighted average
of two valuations: the pledgeable fraction θ of the asset is valued using the market discount factor 1/ (1 + r ), the unpledgeable fraction 1 − θ is valued using the discount factor


of the constrained B agent βu0 c2B /u0 c1B . This equation comes from deriving first order conditions of the problem and solving for lagrange multipliers. The last inequality
ensures that the borrowing constraint is binding, i.e., that the Lagrange multiplier on the
collateral constraint is positive. The last two conditions imply that when the collateral
constraint is binding the asset price is depressed below its first best value

Using log preferences it is possible to manipulate the conditions just presented and

(17)

This implies that as the government purchases more of the asset, i.e. as x is reduced,
the consumption c1B increases, the consumption c2B decreases (directly from (15)), and the
asset price Q increases (from (16) and the results for c1B , c2B ).
Summing up, if the government purchases enough of the asset the equilibrium is unconstrained and consumption of the B agents and the asset price are unaffected by further
asset purchases. If instead purchases are low enough and

then the B agents are constrained and government purchases have the effect of raising

Aggregate demand and asset price effects of asset purchases

Suppose now that in a given state of the world the B agents’ collateral constraint is binding and the government is considering the welfare benefits of an asset purchase. What is
the effect on aggregate demand and thus on real activity for a given level of r? What are
the additional welfare effects of the intervention?
Consider the marginal effects of an increase dx G > 0 from a given x G . The effect on
the consumption of B agents can be obtained from (17) and is positive:

In this economy asset prices are not determined one for one by interest rates as it

it introduces a pecuniary externality that is not directly controlled by the choice of the
interest rate. In particular, as argued above
∂Q
> 0.
∂x G
We can then look at the total welfare effects of an increase in asset purchases x G , using
envelope arguments similar to the ones used in previous sections, and obtain the following marginal effects on social welfare

The first effect is the aggregate demand effect, the second is a redistributive effect associated to an increase in asset prices, which is good for the B agents selling the asset and bad

for the A agents who, through government intervention, are purchasing the asset. Finally,
the third effect is the direct benefit of the intervention in terms of employing the asset in
the government technology.

6.3

Complementarity and substitutability

We now want to analyze how the introduction of unconventional policy ex post alters the
benefits of macroprudential policy ex ante. To do so our starting point is an equilibrium
in which asset purchases are zero, x G = 0 and x = 1 in all states.
It is easy to construct examples with two states of the world where the equilibrium has
the following features. In the high δ2 state, the good state, neither the collateral constraint
nor the zero lower bound are binding and the central bank sets r > r so as to satisfy the
optimality condition

derived in Section 3.3. In the low δ2 state, the bad state, both the zero lower bound and
the collateral constraint are binding and we have


In the good state we have u0 (c1A ) > v0 n2A and u0 (c1A ) > βu0 (c1B ): it would be beneficial to
raise rates to redistribute in favor of A agents, since B agents are relatively rich, but raising
rates is costly since there is a positive output gap. In the bad state we have u0 (c1A ) >

v0 n2A and u0 (c1A ) < βu0 (c1B ): it would be beneficial to lower rates both in terms of output
effects and in terms of distributive effects, as B agents are relatively poor, but it is not
possible because we have reached the ZLB.11
Let us look first at the ex post incentives of the central bank to engage in asset purchases. In the good state, the marginal effect on social welfare (18) boils down to

26

we assume F 0 (0) < δ2 . This implies that the optimal policy is at the corner x G = 0. In
the bad state on the other hand, all three terms in (18) can be positive if it is the case
that F 0 (0) − Q ≥ 0 in equilibrium. The aggregate demand effect is positive because the
consumption of both A and B agents is increasing in x G : for the B agents because their
constrained gets relaxed, for the A agents because the government is passing them the
profits made purchasing assets at distressed prices. The redistributive effect is positive
because higher asset prices benefit the B agents with higher marginal utility. And the
direct fiscal benefit is positive because, again, the government is making profits on the
asset purchases. So on net asset purchases are beneficial ex post.
Now let us look at the motive for macroprudential policy ex ante. The marginal effect

to the fact that higher asset prices reallocate resources from A to B agents. In the configuration discussed here ∂Q/∂D = 0 in the good state as the collateral constraint is slack. In
the bad state, conditions (15)-(17) can be used to show that ∂Q/∂D < 0. In the configuration discussed here with βu0 (c1B ) > u0 (c1A ) in the bad state the second effect is negative as
soon as x G is not zero. Therefore, given our configuration at x G = 0 and, by continuity,
for x G near zero, the total externality ex ante is negative and a tax on borrowing is welfare
improving.
Now we can return to the question addressed of this paper: how does the use of
policy ex post (asset purchases now) affect the desirability of borrowing tax ex ante? In
general it seems to depend on the relative strength of the two externalities identified.
The aggregate demand externality gets smaller as asset purchases increase, as an increase
in x G leads to an increase in output which reduces the output gap. On the other hand,
the pecuniary externality gets larger as we move from x G = 0 to x G > 0. However, in
the numerical examples we have explored the aggregate demand externality dominates
and the economy features a smaller borrowing tax when ex post asset purchases take
place. So the example we have solved with the features above suggest that also when
unconventional monetary tools are used, ex post interventions seem to be substitutes for
ex ante macroprudential policy.

Concluding remarks

In this paper we have shown that the presence of aggregate demand externalities tends
to reverse the conventional wisdom on the need of corrective macroprudential policy to
balance ex post monetary interventions that prop up asset prices, either by interest rate
policy or by unconventional asset purchases.
Our model is stylized and we have proceeded by examples and counterexamples, so
our take away is not that moral hazard concerns regarding central bank interventions are
necessarily unfounded. Rather our model is a cautionary tale on how looking at the positive predictions of the models (lower rates ex post lead to more borrowing) can lead to
incorrect conclusions on complementarity or substitutability between ex ante macroprudential tools and ex post monetary policy.

and the goods market clearing conditions,

c2A + c2B = δ2 .

We use Y to denote produced output in period 1. Then the definition of continuation
equilibrium above defines a mapping Y ( D, r, s), which corresponds to the equilibrium
produced output in period 1 as a function of the debt level and the level of interest rate.
In the next section we derive an explicit formula for Y ( D, r, s) by considering a specific
functional form for the utility of consumption, the CRRA form.
12 For

ease of notation, whenever possible, we omit the state s for the different endogenous variables.
Note that these variables do vary with the state of the economy.

Notice that θ2 (r ) is negative, while the sign of θ1 (r ) depends on whether γ is greater or
lower than 1. The intuition is as follows. An increase in the interest rate decreases the
value of endowment of B agents in period 2. So the relative discounted income of A
agents goes up. As A agents are more patient and output is demand-determined, this
channel decreases the level of output in period 1. However, a change in the interest rate
also affects B agents through their net endowment, δ1 − D, in period 1. On the one hand,
the substitution effect incentivizes households to increase their demand for savings and
lower consumption in period 1. On the other hand, there is an income effect incentivizing households to increase consumption in period 1. With log preferences (γ = 1) the
substitution and income effect cancel each other and the expressions above become:

The interest rates are

It is immediate to check that all conditions for a zero-output-gap equilibrium are satisfied.
It is also easy to check that the optimal monetary policy condition (10) is satisfied, since
both of its terms are equal to zero in all states.
Note that when there is no uncertainty, i.e., σ = 0, we have that the inertial regime is
equivalent to the proactive regime.
8.2.2

Proof of Proposition 2

Proof. Without loss of generality we let
δ2 = δ̄ + σz ,
where δ̄ is the mean of δ2 , z is a random variable with mean 0 and variance of 1, and σ is
a positive scalar. In this proof we show that there exists a σ, such that if σ ∈ (0, σ ) then
the level of borrowing in the inertial regime is lower than in the proactive regime.

In this proof we use a change of variables: m = 1+1 β 1+
r , and b = 1+ β D. Since the
proof uses only quantities in period 1, we use the notation c a ≡ c1A and cb ≡ c1B . Using the

33

change of variables we have that
c A = m(δ̄ + σz) + βb ,
c B = m(δ̄ + σz) − b ,
Y = 2m(δ̄ + σz) − (1 − β)b .

where the first one is the equation which pins down the level of borrowing, and the second one is the optimality condition for the social planner’s choice of interest rate. We can

H (m, b, σ) = E 1 + β + (1 − β)
m(δ̄ + σz) + βb
(26)
In equilibrium both G (m, b, σ) and H (m, b, σ) are equal to 0. So these two equations define
an implicit equilibrium levels of m and b given σ, m(σ) and b(σ ):
G ( m ( σ ), b ( σ ), σ ) = 0 ,

(27)

H ( m ( σ ), b ( σ ), σ ) = 0 .

(28)

A corollary of proposition 1 is that the levels of m and b in the proactive regime are
equal to m(0) and b(0), i.e., the inertial regime equilibrium when there is no uncertainty
about δ2 . We want to show that b(σ) < b(0) for σ in the neighborhood of 0. As a
byproduct, we also show that m(σ) < m(0) for small enough σ. To do so, we prove
that m0 (0) = b0 (0) = 0 and that both m00 (0) and b00 (0) are negative. This, in turn, implies
that around a neighborhood of σ = 0 both m(σ) and b(σ ) are lower than m(0) and b(0).
Step I - showing m0 (0) = b0 (0) = 0. We take total derivative of equations (27) and (28):
Gm (σ)m0 (σ ) + Gb (σ)b0 (σ ) + Gσ (σ ) = 0 ,
Hm (σ )m0 (σ) + Hb (σ )b0 (σ) + Hσ (σ) = 0 ,
where Gm (σ ) is a short notation for Gm (m(σ ), b(σ), σ ), and similarly for the other partial
derivatives. We can rearrange the following equations at σ = 0 to obtain

Proof of Proposition 3

Proof. Proposition 1 and equation (12) imply that there is no benefit from changing the
level of borrowing, D, in the proactive regime. In what follows we prove that in the
inertial regime a decrease in the level of borrowing has welfare benefits.

Figure 4: Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis for numerical results

Our baseline numerical example features the following parameterization:
β = 0.5,

γ = 0.5,

ψ = 1,

φ = 1,

δ1 = 0.

Figure 4 displays the results of the model for different parameter values. The plots in
the top row present the level of overborrowing: the difference between socially optimal
D and D under no tax, both for the inertial and for the proactive regime. The plots in
the bottom row present the optimal macroprudential tax τ under both regimes. In each
column, we vary one parameter at a time, holding constant all the other parameters.
The fact that the red lines are consistently above the blue lines show that in all the
examples considered the inertial regime displays more severe overborrowing.
