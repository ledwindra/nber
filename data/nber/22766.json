    "abstract": "\n\nTwo important recent trends in most developing countries have are the rise in female labor force participation and the closing of gender gaps in school enrollment. This article begins by exploring the causes of the increases in female education, which include greater job availability and policy interventions that have promoted girls\u2019 education. The article then explores the causes of increased female employment, which include a sectoral shift from \u201cbrawn-based\u201d industries to services, as well as policies that have increased girls\u2019 education. The article also discusses the effects of these increases in female education and labor supply, particularly for the well-being of women.\n\n",
