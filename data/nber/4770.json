    "abstract": "\n\nFollowing Phillip's original work on the UK, applied research on unemployment and wages has been dominated by the analysis of highly aggregated time-series data sets.  However, it has proved difficult with such methods to uncover statistically reliable models.  This paper adopts a different approach.  It uses microeconomic data on 175,000 British workers from 1973-1990 to provide evidence for the existence of a negatively sloped relationship linking the level of pay to the local rate of unemployment.  This 'wage curve' is found to have an elasticity of approximately -0.1.  Contrary to the Phillips Curve, no autoregression is found in wages.  The paper casts doubt on standard ideas in macroeconomics, regional economics and labour economics.\n\n",
