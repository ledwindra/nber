ABSTRACT
We investigate the relationship between the extent of a city’s subway network, its population and
its spatial configuration. For the 632 largest cities in the world we construct panel data describing
population, measures of centralization calculated from lights at night data, and the extent of each
of the 138 subway systems in these cities. These data indicate that large cities are more likely to
have subways but that subways have an economically insignificant effect on urban population
growth. Our data also indicate that subways cause cities to decentralize, although the effect is
smaller than previously documented effects of highways on decentralization. For a subset of
subway cities we observe panel data describing subway and bus ridership. For those cities we
find that a 10% increase in subway extent causes about a 6% increase in subway ridership and has
no effect on bus ridership.

1. Introduction
We investigate the relationship between the extent of a city’s subway network and its population,
transit ridership and spatial configuration. To accomplish this investigation, for the 632 largest
cities in the world we construct panel data describing population, total light, measures of centralization calculated from lights at night data, and the extent of each of the 138 subway systems in
these cities. For a subset of these subway cities we also assemble panel data describing bus and
subway ridership.
These data suggest the following conclusions. First, while large cities are more likely to have
subways, subways have a precisely estimated near zero effect on urban population growth. Second, subways cause cities to decentralize, although this effect appears to be small relative to the
decentralization caused by radial highways. Third, a 10% increase in subway extent leads to about
a 6% increase in subway ridership and does not affect bus ridership. A back of the envelope
calculation suggests that only a small fraction of ridership increases can be accounted for by
decentralized commuters. Together with the fact that little new ridership can be attributed to
population growth, this suggests that most new ridership derives from a substitution from other
modes of travel towards subways.
Subway construction and expansion projects range from merely expensive to truly breathtaking. Among the 16 subway systems examined by Baum-Snow and Kahn (2005), construction costs
range from about 25m to 550m usd2005 per km. On the basis of the mid-point of this range,
287m per km, construction costs for the current stock are about 3 trillion dollars. These costs
are high enough that subway projects generally require large subsidies. To justify these subsidies,
proponents often assert the ability of a subway system to encourage urban growth.1 Our data allow
the first estimates of the relationship between subways and urban growth. That subways appear
to have almost zero effect on urban growth suggests that the evaluation of prospective subway
projects should rely less on the ability of subways to promote growth and more on the demand
for mobility. Our data also allows the first panel data estimates of the impact of changes in system
extent on ridership and therefore also make an important contribution to such evaluations.
Understanding the effect of subways on cities is also important to policy makers interested
in the process of urbanization in the developing world. Over the coming decades, we expect
an enormous migration of rural population towards major urban areas, and with it demands for
urban infrastructure that exceed the ability of local and national governments to supply it. In
order to assess trade-offs between different types of infrastructure in these cities, understanding
the implications of each for welfare is clearly important. Since people move to more attractive
places and away from less attractive ones (broadly defined), our investigation of the relationship
between subways and population growth will help to inform these decisions. In particular, if the

objective of policymakers is to increase a city’s population or to decentralize economic activity,
highways seem more promising. On the other hand, in a related companion paper, GendronCarrier et al. (2017) show that if the objective is to reduce pollution, then subways can be effective.
Finally, an active academic literature investigates the effect of transportation infrastructure on
the growth and configuration of cities. In spite of their prominence in policy debates, subways
have so far escaped the attention of this literature. This primarily reflects the relative rarity of
subways. Most cities have roads so a single country can provide a large enough sample to analyze
the effects of roads on cities. Subways are too rare for this. A statistical analysis of the effect of
subways on cities requires data from, at least, several countries. An important contribution of this
paper is to assemble data that describe all of the world’s subway networks. In addition, with few
exceptions, the current literature on the effects of infrastructure is static or considers panel data
that is too short to investigate the dynamics of infrastructure’s effects on cities. Because our panel
spans the 60 year period from 1950 until 2010, we are able to investigate such dynamic responses
to the provision of subways.
To estimate the causal effects of subways on urban growth and urban form, we must grapple
with the fact that subway systems and stations are not constructed at random times and places.
This suggests two potential threats to causal identification. The first could occur if subway expansions systematically take place at times when a city’s population growth is slower (or faster)
than average. For example, if construction crews leave the city when new subway expansions are
complete or if subway expansions tend to occur when some constraint on a city’s growth begins
to bind. The second results from omitted variables. For example, suppose that cities expand their
bus networks in years when they do not expand their subway networks and that bus and subway
networks contribute equally to population growth. Then any regression of population growth
on subway growth that omits a measure of the bus network will be biased downward. Briefly,
we address the problem of confounding dynamics by showing that the null population growth
result is invariant to using first differences, instrumented first differences, second differences and
dynamic panel data models. The instrument we propose takes advantage of the fact that larger
subway systems grow more slowly and this allows us to predict subway growth using long lags
of subway system size. We address the omitted variables issue by showing that the null effect of
subways on population is not masking heterogenous effects by measures such as congestion, road
supply, bus supply, institutional quality, city size, or size of network, among others.

2. Literature
A Subways
With a few exceptions that we describe below, the literature that analyzes the effects of subways on
cities consists entirely of analyses of a single city. Nevertheless, this literature is large and we here
focus our attention on the small set of papers which attempt to resolve the problem of non-random

3

assignment of subways. More complete surveys are available in Billings (2011) and Gibbons and
Machin (2005).
Gibbons and Machin (2005) examine housing prices in London during the periods 1997-1999
and 2000-2001, periods that bracket two expansions of the London underground. Gibbons and
Machin (2005) calculate various difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of these transit
expansions on housing prices and find that moving one km away from a subway station decreases
house values by about 2% for the first two km, and about zero thereafter. Billings (2011) conducts
a similar exercise for a new light rail line in Charlotte, North Carolina.2 Like Gibbons and Machin
(2005), Billings (2011) estimates the effect of subways on housing prices using a difference-indifferences estimator. Despite differences in milieu and method, Billings (2011) arrives at estimates
quite close to those of Gibbons and Machin (2005): single family houses within 1.6km of the
transit line see their prices increase by about 4% while condominiums see their prices rise by about
11%. Like Gibbons and Machin (2005), Billings (2011) observes that changes result from subway
construction over the course of just a few years.3
Each of these papers makes a credible attempt to overcome the fact that subway systems are not
located randomly within cities. However, neither provides us with much information about the
relationship between subways and city-level growth. If subways affect the growth of cities, then
they may affect it everywhere, both near and far from a station. By construction, a differencesin-differences methodology cannot measure such citywide effects. Therefore, while the existing
literature makes some progress on the problem of non-random assignment of subways to places,
it does so at a high cost. The difference-in-differences methodology cannot tell us about the effect
of changes in the overall level of activity within a city. Unless we are specifically interested in
reorganizing economic activity across neighborhoods within a city, it is changes in the overall level
which are of primary policy interest and which are the object of our investigation.
Finally, in an important contribution Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2015) estimate a
structural model of how a subway network can restructure a city, rather than just whether subways
attract development. Given this, it is closest in spirit to our decentralization exercise. With this
said, Ahlfeldt et al. (2015) use time series variation from just one city, so their ability to investigate
the effect of subways on urban growth relies heavily on the assumptions underlying their model.
There are few studies considering cross city or panel data on transit and city level outcomes.
Pang (2017) and Gendron-Carrier et al. (2017) are rare exceptions. Pang (2017) uses US data to
investigate the effect of public transit on employment rates for low-skilled workers, and finds
that low skilled workers are more likely to be employed as their access to subways improves.
Gendron-Carrier et al. (2017) is a companion paper to this one, and uses an event study methodology to investigate the relationship between airborne particulates and subway system opening. In
2 The Charlotte light rail system is not completely isolated from pedestrian and automobile traffic and so does not
appear in our data as a subway.

that a terrorist attack in London in 2005 disproportionately affected real estate prices near subway stations.

a sample of about 40 cities all over the world, it finds that subway openings cause economically
important reductions in pollution.
Apart from these two, the only studies to investigate the effects of subways on city level
outcomes are primarily or completely interested in ridership.4 On the basis of a single cross-section
of about 50 cities, Gordon and Willson (1984) conduct a city level regression to predict riders per
mile of track as a function of city population density and country level per capita gdp. They find
that these two variables are excellent predictors of ridership - the relationship being positive and
negative, respectively. Finally, Baum-Snow and Kahn (2005) provide evidence from 16 US cities
for a similar relationship between density and transit use, although their small sample size limits
the precision of their results. They also show that ridership shares in catchment areas for new
stations attain almost the same level as in the catchment areas of old stations over their 30 year
study period. Consistent with the finding in Gordon and Willson (1984) that ridership decreases
with income and increases with density, Baum-Snow and Kahn (2005) find that most US transit
expansions have only small effects on ridership, a conclusion echoed in Gomez-Ibanez (1996) for
time series data on the use of Boston’s transit system. Our results on the relationship between
subway extent and ridership are the first to exploit city level panel data. Barnes (2005) provides
evidence from a few cities in the US that people are more likely to take transit for trips to a central
business district than for trips to other locations.
B Other infrastructure
Redding and Turner (2015) survey the literature relating roads and highways to urban growth.
This literature has developed rapidly over the past several years and suggests the following
conclusions.
First, Duranton and Turner (2012) find that the stock of highways in a city contributes to the
growth in city population in the us between 1980 and 2000. This effect is small in an absolute sense,
though it is economically important as a share of the total growth rate. Using a similar research
design, Garcia-López, Holl, and Viladecans-Marsal (2015) finds that highways cause about the
same rate of population growth in Spanish cities.5
Second, that radial highways can have dramatic effects on the internal structure of cities. BaumSnow (2007) investigates the effect of radial highways on population decentralization for a sample
of large US cities between 1950 and 1990. He finds that, over the whole 40 year course of his
study period, a single radial highway causes about a 9% decrease in central city population. This
large decentralizing effect of highways is confirmed for China by Baum-Snow, Brandt, Henderson,
Turner, and Zhang (2017) and for Spain by Garcia-López (2012).
4 We note the large literature on modal choice using individual level data. This important literature is only tangentially related to our present inquiry. A survey is available in Small and Verhoef (2007).
5 Related to this, Blonigen and Cristea (2015) and Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott (2018) investigate the role of
airports in urban growth and argue for a causal relationship between airport traffic and urban growth.

5

Finally, Duranton and Turner (2011) and Hsu and Zhang (2014) find that vehicle kilometers
traveled increase about proportionately to increases in the extent a city’s road network, and that
increases to non-commute driving appear to be the most important contributor to this increase.
All of these responses, decentralization, growth and driving, can be detected over a 5-20 year time
horizon, much shorter than our 60 year study period.
In contrast, we find that the effects of subways on urban growth are tiny. We find a much larger
effect of subways on the configuration of cities. The effect of subways on ridership is large, though
probably smaller than the effect of roads on driving. Finally, we will present indirect evidence to
suggest that only a small fraction of the increase in ridership reflects decentralized commuters.
More likely, commuters shift their mode of transportation towards subways.

3. Results vs. Theory
Anticipating our results, our data indicate that marginal changes to a city’s subway network have
the following effects. First, subways have approximately zero effect on a city’s population. Second,
subways cause cities to decentralize in a way that is qualitatively similar to the way that roads
cause cities to decentralize. Third, the cities in our sample grow at about 2% per year. In addition,
from Gendron-Carrier et al. (2017), we know that subway openings cause reductions in air pollution that have an estimated value that is of about the same order of magnitude as construction
costs (though the effects of expansions are probably smaller). Finally, what evidence we have on
the matter, e.g., Baum-Snow and Kahn (2005), suggests that subways are very expensive to build
and that fare revenue does not fully cover operating costs.
These facts are consistent with basic theory. To see this, consider a simple linear city. Each
identical agent consumes a unit of land at distance x from the center and commutes to x = 0
where she receives wage, wt . The unit cost of travel is τt and land rent, Rt ( xt ), varies with distance
to the center. Subscripts index two periods, t ∈ {0,1}, an initial period where the subway is smaller
or not present, and a later period when the subway is more extensive.
Denote the most remote occupied location as x t and suppose that land rent is zero beyond this
boundary. Because each agent consumes exactly one unit of land, x t describes both the physical
extent of the city and its population. Agents derive utility from consumption, ct , and from a city
specific amenity, At . They pay a tax Tt to fund the subway. Agents have the choice to reside in the
city of interest, or at some alternative that provides utility u∗t .
A representative agent solves the following problem,
max ct + At
s.t. wt = ct + τt x + Tt − R( x ).
With free mobility, this implies that the boundary of the city is determined by the following

6

condition,
xt =

wt + At − Tt − u∗t
.
τt

Our finding that subways do not change city population means that x0 = x1 , and hence that
w1 + A1 − T1 − u1∗
w0 + A0 − T0 − u0∗
=
.
τ0
τ1

(1)

Because cities decentralize with subways, we conclude that they drive down unit transportation
cost. In the context of this model, this means that τ1 < τ0 . Together with equation (1), this requires
that
w0 + A0 − T0 − u0∗ > w1 + A1 − T1 − u1∗ .

(2)

If our identification strategy is successful at isolating the effects of quasi-random variation, then
a city with a subway expansion faces the same outside option as a city without. That is, u1∗ = u0∗ .
In this case, our results suggest that whatever beneficial effects subways have on transportation
costs, wages and amenities are about offset by the local share of costs.6
On the other hand, if cities either invest in subways or in some substitute, then we might think
that u1∗ > u0∗ . In this case, our results need to be understood as relative, not to the status quo, but
to the improving outside option. This means that the benefits of subways minus the local share of
costs is no better that the alternative investment.
This model is deliberately stylized and so welfare interpretations should be regarded with care.
In particular, the model omits the possibility that people consume more space as transportation
costs fall. This is surely valuable, but statements about residential density are beyond the reach of
our data and so we omit this margin of adjustment from our model.
In addition, this simple model is based on the assumption that improvements to the subway network reduce transportation costs everywhere. In fact, as we will show, subways overwhelmingly
serve central cities. Since mode transfers are costly, one can therefore imagine that subways could
reduce the cost of commuting within their central service area, while leaving commute costs from
more remote locations more or less unchanged. In this case, changes to the subway system would
not affect the condition determining the edge of the city. Relative to the model articulated above,
such model has the advantage of greater realism and of predicting widely observed increases in
land rent in subway catchment areas. With this said, the same basic intuition holds. In order for
population to remain constant with increases in subways, we require that the increased tax burden
offset improvements in local wages or amenities.
6 To

our knowledge, there is little systematic evidence about subway funding arrangements. Official reports for
Mexico City’s subway system suggest that farebox revenue only accounts for about half of operating costs, the rest
being financed by subsidies from general city funds. In Toronto’s TTC a third of operating costs are covered by the
city’s property tax. Gomez-Ibanez (1996) reports that capital costs for Boston’s subway from about 1965-1990 on were
substantially funded by the federal government.

4. Data
To investigate the effect of subways on the evolution of cities’ population, spatial structure and
transit ridership, we require data for a panel of cities. We construct such data from four principal
sources. Our population data are the un World Cities Data. Our subway data are the result of
primary data collection, as is our ridership data. Our description of urban spatial structure derives
from satellite lights at night data.
A Population data
Our data are organized around the un World Cities Data.7 Produced by the United Nations,
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, these data describe population
counts for all cities whose population exceeds 750,000 at any time during 1950-2010.
Constructing international data describing city level population is subject to two difficulties.
First, population data are generally, but not always, available from decennial or quinquennial
censuses, but do not synchronize neatly across countries. To resolve this problem, the un World
Cities Data interpolate across available censuses to construct annual values. Therefore, because
few countries conduct censuses more often than every five years, successive annual population
changes must sometimes reflect linear interpolation of the same proximate census years. To avoid
making inferences from such imputed population changes, we restrict attention to observations
drawn every fifth year (e.g., 1950, 1955, ...) and refer to each such observation as a ‘city-year’. This
decreases the likelihood that sequential city-years are calculated by interpolation from the same
two underlying censuses. In fact, for some countries, census data is available less often than every
five years, so we also experiment with observations drawn every 10 years and with even longer
periods.
A second difficulty arises because metropolitan areas and census units are not defined at the
same scale in all countries. To overcome this problem, the un World Cities Data is based on
population counts at the most geographically disaggregated administrative unit available from
every country. Once equipped with these data, metropolitan areas are defined as a fixed set of
smaller administrative units — regardless of whether the smaller units were in the same state for
example. This allowed un researchers to use a consistent definition of metropolitan areas across
countries and over time, and captures what we think of as metropolitan areas.
The top panel of Table 1 describes our population data. The data consist of 632 cities, more than
half in Asia. In 2010, the mean population of a city in our sample is about 2.4 million. There is little
variation in mean population across continents, although cities in South America tend to be larger
while cities in Europe tend to be smaller. Between 1950 and 2010, the mean five year growth rate
of a city in our sample is about 18%. This rate falls by about 1 percentage point every five years.
Not surprisingly, cities in Africa, Asia and South America grow faster than in North America and

Europe. European cities are the obvious outlier and grow more slowly than cities elsewhere. The
growth rate of cities is declining on all continents and this decrease is somewhat slower in Europe.
The bottom panel of Table 1 describes our population data for the 138 cities in our sample with
a subway in 2010. At 4.7m people on average, these cities are about twice as large as non-subway
cities. Cairo is the single African city with a subway, and so the Africa column in the bottom panel
of table 1 is really a ‘Cairo column’.8 Asian and South American subway cities are larger than those
in North America and dramatically larger than those in Europe. The five year growth rate for an
average subway city is about 11%, slower than in the whole sample. As for the whole sample,
European subway cities are growing more slowly than other subway cities. Also similar to the
whole population of cities, growth rates between 1950 and 2010 are declining by about 1% every
five years and this decrease is somewhat slower in Europe.
B Lights data
Lights at night data are collected by earth observing satellites that measure the intensity of visible
light every night in 30 arc second cells (about one kilometer square) on a regular grid covering

the entire world. Most extant applications of the lights at night data in economics rely on the
"DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights Time Series".9 These data are available annually from 1992 until
2012. Each of these lights at night images is a composite constructed from many raw satellite
images and the value for each cell reflects average light intensity, over all cloud free images, on a
scale of 0-62 with 63 used as a topcode. Since most large cities, particularly in the developed world
contain large topcoded regions near their centers, these data are of limited use for studying the
internal structure of the large wealthy cities where most subways are located. We instead exploit
‘radiance calibrated lights at night data’,10 collected during times when the satellite sensor was set
to be less sensitive. These data are less able to distinguish dim light sources, but are able to measure
variation in light within regions that are topcoded in DMSP-OLS version. Fewer cross-sections of

the radiance calibrated lights are available but the available cross-sections (ca. 1995, 2000, 2005 and
2010) match up neatly with the last four cross-sections of our population data.
Lights at night data are of interest as a check on our population data. The lights at night data are
measured consistently across cities and we can calculate city level measures of total light without
reference to administrative boundaries. That is, the lights at night data are not subject to either
of the two problems that we are concerned about for our population data. Since people light the
places they live and work, more densely populated and more productive places are often brighter.
More concretely, Henderson and Storeygard 2012 use the topcoded version of lights at night data
to show that country level mean light intensities are a good proxy for gdp, a result that Storeygard
(2017) confirms at the regional level for China.
The bottom panel of table 1 shows the correlation of the mean 2010 light intensity within
25km of a city center and 2010 population in subway cities. It is clear that lights provide some
information about population, although this information is imperfect. Finally, we note that the
lights at night data are difficult to interpret. While we can be confident that lights at night data are
telling us something about the location of economic activity, we cannot know whether places are
brighter because the people living there are richer or because the place is more densely populated.
C Centralization
We also use the lights data to describe urban centralization. The resolution of the radiance calibrated lights data we use is about 1km square. This is small enough to provide information about
the way that cities are laid out, and inspection of figure 2 shows that the lights data reflect broad
patterns of urban density.
In order to describe the ‘centralization’ of each city, we follow a long tradition in urban economics of calculating density gradients (e.g., Clark, 1951; Mills and Peng 1980). In our case, we
estimate a light intensity gradient for every city-year to measure the rate at which density decays
with distance from the center. To do this, we first calculate mean light intensity, for disks with radius 1.5km, 5km, 10km, 25km and 50k, around each city’s centroid. These disks describe a series of
doughnuts surrounding the center of each city. Let xi ∈ {0.75km, 3.25km, 7.5km, 17.5km, 37.5km}
be the radii of the circles lying halfway between the inner and outer border of these doughnuts.
For example, xi = 3.25 lies halfway between the inner and outer radius of the doughnuts that
extends from 1500m to 5km from a city’s center. For each such doughnut, let yi denote the average
light intensity in the doughnut.11 All together, for each city, we now have 5 pairs of light intensity
and distance, (yi ,xi ).
To characterize the centrality of each city, we estimate the following regression
ln yi = A + B ln xi + ei .

(3)

11 We note that we do not make any adjustments for geographic features such as mountains or surface water when
performing this calculation.

11

The coefficient B in this regression is the rate at which light decays with a change in distance from
the center, and will be our measure of centrality for each city in each year. All else equal, a city with
a more negative value of B sees its density decrease more quickly with distance from the center,
and is therefore, ‘more centralized’.
Table 1 reports sample mean values of A and B for the sample of all cities and subway cities.
We see that the gradient for an average city is 0.79. Thus, density falls by 79% with a doubling
of distance. Not too surprisingly, cities in Africa and South America are more centralized, while
cities in North America are less centralized. Subway cities are slightly less centralized than cities
without subways. For these cities, density falls by 72% with a doubling of distance. Interestingly,
North American subway cities are particularly spread out, with a density gradient of 0.58.
D Subways data
We define a ‘subway’ as an electric powered urban rail that is completely isolated from interactions
with automobile traffic and pedestrians. This excludes most streetcars, because they interact with
vehicle traffic at stoplights and crossings, although we include underground streetcar segments. In
order to focus on intra-urban subway transportation systems, we also exclude heavy rail commuter
lines. We do not distinguish between surface, underground or aboveground subway lines as long
as the exclusive right of way condition is satisfied. For the most part, our subways data describe
public transit systems that would ordinarily be described as ‘subways’, e.g., the Paris metro and
the New York city subway, and only such systems. As with any such definition, the inclusion or
exclusions of particular marginal cases in our sample may be controversial.
On the basis of this definition, we assemble data describing the latitude, longitude and date
of opening of every subway station in the world. We compiled these data manually between
January 2012 and February 2014 using the following process. First, using online sources such as
http://www.urbanrail.net/ and links therein, together with links on wikipedia, we complied a
list of all subway stations worldwide. Next, for each station on our list, we record opening date,
station name, line name, terminal station indicator, transfer station indicator, city and country.
Latitude and longitude for each station were obtained from google maps. This process leads us to
enumerate subway stations in 161 cities. Of these, 138 are large enough to appear in the un World
Cities Data and are the main subject of our analysis.12
We use our data to construct three measures of subway extent for each city-year. First, we count
the number of operational stations in each year. Second, we count the number of operational
subway lines in each city in each year. Finally, by connecting stations on each subway line by the
shortest possible route, we approximate the route of each subway line. Taking the union of all such
lines in a city approximates each city’s network and calculating the length of this network gives us
12 The

23 cities with subways in 2010 that do not occur in our population data because their population is too
small are: Bielefeld, Bilbao, Bochum, Catania, Dortmund, Duisburg, Dusseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Genova, Hannover,
Kitakyushu, Kryvyrih, Lausanne, Mulheim, Naha, Nuremberg, Palma, Perugia, Rennes, Rouen, Seville and Wuppertal.

12

the length of each system. In this way we arrive at our three primary measures of subway extent
for each city-year; operational stations, operational lines and route kilometers.
Figure 2 illustrates our subway data for six cities. The figure shows all stations operational
prior to 2010 as dots. The network maps, on which the 2010 calculation of route km is based, are
shown as connecting lines. In each panel of the figure, the large(small) circle or ellipse describes a
circle of 25(5)km radius to show scale. This circle is distorted in Northerly cities as a consequence
of our map projection. To show the configuration of each city, the background shows lights at
night in 2010. In the top row, with 2010 populations of 1.1m and 0.9m Tibilsi (Georgia) and
Toulouse (France) are among the smallest cities in our sample to have subways. In 2010 their
subway systems consist of 21 and 37 stations, and 27 and 28 route km. In the middle row, Boston
and Singapore have populations of 4.7m and 5.1m, near the 4.7m mean for subway cities. Their
subway systems consist of 74 and 78 stations and of 88 and 111 route km, which makes both
systems somewhat larger than both world and the relevant continental averages. The bottom row
of figure 2 shows two of the largest cities in our sample, Mexico City and Beijing. The population
of Mexico City in 2010 was just over 20m against about 15m for Beijing. Their subway systems
contained 147 and 124 stations and consisted of 182 and 209 route kilometers.
Figure 2 reveals that in each of the six cities only a small portion of the city is within walking
distance of a subway and the catchment area of the subway is centrally located. This is typical. An
average city in our sample has about 57 stations. Of these, about 9% are within 1500m of the center,
about 29% are between 1500m and 5km of the center, about the same share lie between 5 and 10km
and between 10 and 25km. Just 7% of stations are beyond 25km from the center. Since the area to
be served expands quadratically, this means that subways per square kilometer decreases rapidly
with radial distance. In an average subway city, there are 0.67 stations per km2 within 1500m of
the center, 0.22 stations per km2 between 1500m and 5km from the center, 0.07 stations per km2
between 5 and 10km from the center, and 0.001 stations per km2 between 10 and 25km from the
center. Thus, in an average city, the preponderance of the subway system is located within 10km
of the center and station density decreases rapidly with distance from the center. This is consistent
with the argument that public transit preponderantly serves downtown cores in Glaeser, Kahn,
and Rappaport (2008).
Close inspection of the network maps in figure 2 suggests that our networks probably diverge
slightly from the actual network. The algorithm that we use to construct network maps connects
all open stations on a subway line by the shortest possible route. Therefore, our measure of length
is a measure of the route kilometers required to serve operational stations in each year rather than
a literal measure of the length of track in the system.13 While we regard the route kilometers
13 Our

algorithm will produce routes that diverge from the actual routes for four reasons. First, if pairs of stations
are connected with curving track, the actual route will diverge from our straight line network. Second, if intermediate
stations on a line open after the end points, then the algorithm will not include the intermediate stations on the network
until they open. Third, we may mis-attribute stations to subway lines. Fourth, if a route is served by two or more sets
of tracks — such as in New York city — then this replication is invisible to us.

measure as being of considerable interest, we suspect it is a noisier measure of subway extent than
is the count of operational stations. Given this, our investigation relies primarily on the count
of operational stations to measure system extent, although our results are robust to the choice of
subway measure.
Table 1 describes the world’s subway systems in 2010. In 2010 in our sample of cities, there

14

were 7,886 operational subway stations and 10,672 route kilometers of subways, divided across 138
operational systems. Of these 138 subway cities, 53 are in Asia, 40 in Europe, 30 in North America,
14 in South America and one in Africa. Asia, Europe, North America and South America account
for 38, 35, 20 and 6 percent of all operational stations in 2010. The corresponding percentages of
route kilometers are 39 for Asia, 33 for Europe, 21 for North America and 6 for South America.
Thus, Asia has more systems than Europe, but a typical system in Europe has more stations and
route kilometers. North America accounts for a small share of subway stations and route km, it
contains a small number of systems and the average extent of these systems is between that of
Asian and European systems.
Table 1 reveals substantial differences in the availability of subways across continents. Of the
347 large cities in Asia only 53, about 15%, have subway systems. In Europe, more than two thirds
of large cities have subways, while in North America it is just less than one third. South America is
a bit lower at 25%. Conditional on being in a subway city, the level of service also varies widely by
continent. Cities are smaller and subway systems larger in Europe where there are 25,000 people
per route km and 32,000 per station. These service levels are higher than those in North America
and Asia and higher still than those in Asian and South American subway cities. Interestingly,
although the share of North American cities with subways is much higher than in Asia, people per
station and people per route km in subway cities are close for the two continents.
Two features of table 1 stand out. First, the huge gap in subway provision between Europe and
the rest of the world. Second, the weak connection between mean city size and subway extent.
In particular, Asia is home to the preponderance of the world’s large cities while South America’s
cities are larger, on average, than those elsewhere. However, neither South America nor Asia is
well provided with subways relative to Europe and North America. Indeed, Europe’s cities are the
smallest and slowest growing, and it is by far the best provided with subways.
Figure 1 illustrates the expansion of the world’s subway systems over the past century. There
were four subway systems in operation prior to or during 1860; Liverpool, Boston, London and
New York. The "L" opened in Chicago in 1892 and The Paris Metro opened in 1900. Both the
aggregate world data and the continental data, except for Asia, show a first wave of subway construction between the two world wars and a second wave beginning in the 1970s and continuing
to 2010. The growth of Asian subways begins in the 1970s and has accelerated since. Except for
North America, expansion of subway systems and increases in the number of subway cities track
each other closely. In 2010, the 1,169 subway stations operating in the us were spread across 21
cities. However, 489 of these stations were in New York. Chicago is the second largest system at
142 stations. On average, the remaining 19 us subway cities have just 29 stations each, just over
half the sample average.

E Public transit ridership data
We collected panel data on public transit ridership for the cities in our database from publicly
available sources and reports. We were able to obtain data on 77 subway systems and 40 bus
transit systems.14 Table 2 shows ridership descriptive statistics for subways and buses in 2010.
Bus systems provide on average 240 million trips per year, whereas subways provide on average
380 million trips per year. In per capita terms (columns 5-8), subways and buses are about equally
important in terms of rides per person per year. This is true not only when comparing averages,
but also when comparing cities for which both types of ridership information are available.

5. The relationship between subways and population
We now turn to a description of the relationship between subways and population. Figure 3 shows
the relationship in 2010 between city size and the incidence of subway systems for all of the cities
in our sample excluding Tokyo.15 The horizontal axis gives city population by 0.5m bin and the
vertical axis gives the proportion of cities with subways for each bin. We split our sample of cities
into rich and poor country cities on the basis of the imf advanced economy list for 2012.16 Grey
squares and black triangles indicate the share of rich and poor country cities with subways. The
markers are spaced irregularly along the horizontal axis because some population bins are empty.
The solid line is a smoothed plot of subway frequency in rich country cities and the dashed line is
the corresponding plot for poor country cities.17
14 Information on bus ridership by year is only reported by integrated transit systems, something that is not common
in developing countries. In particular, we have no bus ridership data for cities in Africa and South America.
15 At 36 million people, Tokyo is nearly twice as large as the second largest city. We omit it from the figure to improve
legibility.
16 These rich countries are: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Singapore,
South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
17 More specifically, both lines are kernel weighted local polynomial regressions.

16

Proportion with subway system

Figure 3: Proportion of cities with subways systems by population for two income classes

Population in millions
Note: Gray squares correspond to rich country cities and black triangles to poor
country cities. See footnote 16 for the list of countries.

There are no rich country cities with population above 5m without a subway system and subways are common even among rich country cities with populations in the 1m-5m range. Subways
are relatively rare among developing country cities with populations less than about 5m and their
frequency increases more or less smoothly with city size.
Table 3 describes the largest 90 cities in our sample as of 2010. For each city, the table reports
population, the count of operational stations and the number of stations per 100,000 of population.
Despite the strong relationship between city size and the presence of a subway system that we see
in figure 3, table 3 suggests that the relationship between population and subways is nuanced. In
particular, none of the four cities larger than New York has even half as many subway stations.
Looking down the list, we see that such reversals are common and do not simply reflect rich and
poor country differences. Consistent with this, the raw correlation between operational stations
and population in 2010 is about 0.58. While subways are clearly more common in big cities, the
relationship between system extent and city size is noisy. Because some of the world’s largest cities
have no subway system to speak of, table 3 suggests that subway capacity may not be a binding
constraint on city size.

We now turn to an investigation of what happens to a city when its subway system is inaugurated. Figure 4 presents three panels describing the relationship between changes in population
and the introduction of a subway system in a city using event study graphs.
The top panel of figure 4 shows the average population growth rate of cities as a function of the
time since their subway system opened.18 This figure is based on data describing the 61 cities that
opened their subway between 1970 and 1990, the set of cities for which we can calculate population
growth rates both for 20 years before and after their subway opens. This figure shows that the
average population growth rate during the five years following the opening of a subway system
is about 8%. During the five year period preceding a subway opening by five years, the average
population growth rate is about 12%. During the 20 years before and after a subway opening, the
average city in our sample sees its growth rate decrease and there is no obvious change in this
trend around the opening of the subway system.
The decrease in population growth rates visible in the top panel reflects a sample-wide decrease in growth rates. It may be that this downward trend masks increases in growth rates
associated with subway system openings. Figure 5 investigates this possibility by controlling
for each period’s mean growth rate. Using the same sample as in the top panel, for each year
we calculate each city’s residual growth rate from a regression of growth rates on continent and
year dummies. We next calculate the average of these residuals conditional on time from subway
opening. Unsurprisingly, this process removes the downward trend that we see in the first three
panels. Perhaps more surprisingly, it still does not show a systematic change in growth rates
following subway system inaugurations.
Figures 4 and 5 show that city population growth rates do not increase during the 20 year period
following the opening of a subway system. As we discuss in section 2, the literature documents
effects of subways on within city outcomes over much shorter periods and the effects of other
types of infrastructure on city level outcomes over a 10-20 year horizon. Thus, the 40 year period
illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 should be long enough to reveal whether growth rates respond to a
subway system opening. Nevertheless, in figure 6 we use our entire sample of cities and investigate
population growth rates over the longest time period that our 60 year sample allows, 55 years. This
figure suggests that the pattern we see in figure 4 extends nearly 55 years before and after a subway
opening, although our estimates become noisier as the time from the subway opening approaches
55 years.
To check for differences across regions in the relationship between urban growth and subways,
we produce analogous figures continent by continent (not shown). Remarkably, each of the
continents shows a similar pattern. Urban population growth rates decrease in the period around

horizontal axis of each panel is time in years since a subway system in a city is inaugurated, with negative
values indicating years prior and conversely. The vertical axis indicates the mean change in log population — the
population growth rate — for all cities during the five year period ending t years before or after the subway opening.

subway openings and there is no obvious sign of a change in this trend at the time a subway opens.
The only qualification of this statement applies to Europe, where there is a statistically insignificant
positive deviation from trend around the opening of a subway system. We also produced analogs
to figures 4 and 5 where we restrict attention to cities with population above 1m in 1970. This
eliminates the small fast growing cities that qualify for the sample late in the sampling period. The
resulting figures are difficult to distinguish from those presented here in figure 4.
Figures 4, 5 and 6 describe population growth rates as time varies relative to the date of a
subway system opening. In Table 4 we turn our attention to the relationship between subway
expansions and growth rates. The top row of panel (a) describes 138 city-year pairs where a city-year
with a subway expansion is followed by a city-year without a subway expansion (recall that we
use observations every five years so technically the table reflects quinquennial city-periods). On
average, the growth rate in city-years with an expansion is 0.063, and in the subsequent city-year,
without an expansion, it is 0.054. A t-test of the difference between the two means indicates that
they are statistically different with high probability. In short, population growth rates are lower
following a subway expansion than during one.
The remaining three rows of panel (a) of table 4 perform similar calculations for slightly different sets of city-years. In row two we consider the 60 city-year triples for which we observe
a subway expansion followed by two city-years without an expansion. As for row 1, we see
that growth rates decrease following a subway expansion and that the decrease in growth rate
is statistically different from zero. In the third row we consider the 204 pairs of city-years where a
subway expansion follows a city-year without an expansion. The mean growth rate for city-years
preceding a subway expansion is larger than for city-years with an expansion, and this difference
is statistically different from zero. The fourth row of table 4 considers the 141 triples of city-years
where a subway expansion is preceded by two years without an expansion. Again, we see that
city growth rates decrease in the years leading up to a subway expansion. The last row of panel a
in table 4 considers the 64 triples of city-years for which a subway expansion follows and precedes
city-years without expansions. The pattern of the other rows is preserved. Population growth rates
are higher before a subway expansion and lower after, and this trend is statistically different from
zero.
Similarly to the middle of figure 4, panel (b) of table 4 replicates the results of panel (a), but
controls for continent and year fixed effects. Specifically, the values reported in panel (b) of table 4
are regression coefficients β from the regression,
2

β k · I (Time to Expansion Indicatorsit = k ) + eit ,

k =−2

where φj refers to continent dummies and the excluded category for the time to expansion indicators is k = 0. Standard errors are clustered at the city level, and we use the same samples as in the
top panel. We test whether the various time to expansion coefficients are different from the year
zero coefficient using a robust F-test. Panel (b) of the table shows that even after we control for
22

year and continent fixed effects, subway expansions are not associated with a measurable increase
in population growth rates.

6. Econometric model
The descriptive evidence presented so far indicates a positive cross-sectional relationship between
the extent of a city’s subway network and its population. Larger cities have more extensive subway
networks. On the other hand, time series evidence suggests that changes to subway networks do
not affect the population of cities. These facts suggest that large cities build and expand subway
networks but that these networks do not cause changes in subsequent population growth. To
establish this causal interpretation of the patterns we see in the raw data, we must address two
main inference problems, confounding dynamics and omitted variables.
A The problem of confounding dynamics
Confounding dynamics arise if subway extent and population evolve such that subways open or
expand in years that are, on average, different from other years. Many examples are possible.
Cities may tend to build and open subways as some constraint to their growth begins to bind
and their growth is slowing. In this case, these cities might have seen a dramatic decrease in
growth had they failed to construct a subway but manage to maintain their growth by adding to
their networks. Alternatively, city population may naturally decrease when subways open and
construction workers leave, and positive effects of subways on growth just offset this loss.
More generally, this class of problems arises when there is some series of population shocks
that systematically precedes an expansion of the subway network and confounds naive estimates
of the relationship between subway expansion and growth. Describing the problem in this way
suggests two possible responses. The first is simply to control for the history of population growth
in the period leading up to a subway expansion. In this way, we can estimate the effect of subways,
holding constant their population growth during the preceding periods. The second is to find an
instrument that predicts subway expansions but is conditionally orthogonal to the hypothetical
sequence of confounding population shocks.
As we will see, subway systems grow along a predictable trajectory (see appendix figure A.1)
and so long lags of subway extent are good predictors of current subway growth (See figure A.2).19
19 Indeed, the growth of subway systems is surprisingly predictable. We can only speculate as to why this might be.
One explanation that would lead to the pattern we observe is that every city’s administration tries to show competence
by adding a subway line to the system. Another possibility is suggested by Gomez-Ibanez’s (Gomez-Ibanez, 1996)
history of the Boston subway. In this history, Gomez-Ibanez documents a series of expansions, partly motivated by the
need to expand the tax base on which to draw for subsidies for the system.

23

By construction, long lags of subway extent pre-date the hypothetical confounding recent history
of population growth, and hence should satisfy the relevant exclusion restriction.20
In the remainder of this section we develop an econometric model that allows us to make this
intuition precise and will form the basis for subsequent estimations. To begin, index the set of
observed cities by i and the set of observed years by t. Let yit denote an outcome of interest for city
i in year t. Depending on context, y will be population, mean light intensity within 25km of the city
center, centrality or ridership. Let sit denote a measure of subway extent in city i in year t, usually
the number of operational stations but sometimes the number of operational subway lines or route
kilometers. Let xit denote a vector of time varying city level covariates, most often country level
population, gdp per capita and continent specific year indicators, and zi a time-invariant vector of
city level controls. The operator ∆ denotes first differences, ∆xt = xt − xt−1 .
We do not have a strong prior over whether subways should affect city population levels or
growth rates additively or multiplicatively. However, plots of population growth against subway
growth in both logarithms and levels clearly suggest that the logarithmic forms better represent
the data. Given this, quantities are typically in logarithms and where necessary we add one to
variables to facilitate this transformation. This also allows us to interpret regression coefficients as
elasticities.
In light of the differences between the time series and cross-sectional relationship between subways and population growth, we are also concerned that cities have time invariant characteristics
correlated with size and subway extent. The following system, while too stark to be defensible,
formalizes this problem and allows a discussion of how our lagged subways instrument addresses
the problem of confounding dynamics.
yit = A1 sit + ci + eit

(4)

sit = B1 sit−k + di + ηit ,

(5)

where A1 , the "outcome elasticity of subway extent", is the parameter of interest and k is a positive
integer. In words, population depends on contemporaneous subways, a city specific intercept and
a random disturbance. Subways at t depend on subways at period t − k, a city specific intercept
and a random disturbance.
Written this way, it is natural to consider using sit−k as an instrument for sit . This is subject
to two objections. First, this system of equation commits us to a particular dynamic structure for
the relationship between subways and population. It is natural to wonder whether this dynamic
structure is correct. In our estimations we consider alternative dynamic structures for our data.
Second, unobserved time invariant determinants of subway construction are probably related to
unobserved time invariant determinants of growth. That is, cov(ci , di ) 6= 0. It follows that, because
20 It

is worth pointing out that our use of long lags of subway system status as a source of quasi-random variation is
conceptually similar to the use of historical networks as instruments for highways, e.g., Duranton and Turner (2012).
The difference is that we here implement a panel data model, which looks quite different from the existing literature on
roads, and our ‘long lags’ are recent relative to the historical network variables used in Duranton and Turner (2012).

24

sit−k also depends on di , we should not expect cov((ci + eit ), sit−k ) = 0. That is, the dynamic
structure described by equations (4) and (5) requires that sit−k be correlated with unobservables in
the population equation, and thus, that it is not a valid instrument in this context.
As a first response to this problem, first difference equations 4 and 5 to get
∆yit = A1 ∆sit + ∆eit

(6)

∆sit = B1 ∆sit−k + ∆ηit .

(7)

Differencing solves two problems. First, and as usual, it removes time-invariant unobservables
from the first equation.21 Second, after removing the city specific intercept from the population
equation, the validity of lagged subways as an instrument for current subways hinges on the
whether cov(∆sit−k , ∆eit ) = 0, or in words, on whether lagged change in subways is uncorrelated
with current change in the time varying propensity to grow. This is simply a more technical
statement of the intuition that motivates this instrumental variables strategy.22
Since ∆sit−k = sit − sit−k and since the error term in equation 6 no longer includes ci , as is
standard in dynamic panel estimation, the same logic that justifies using ∆sit−k as an instrument
also justifies using the component levels. In fact, we find that the levels have much better predictive
ability in the first stage than do changes, and so we rely on lagged levels of log subways as our
instruments.
The discussion above describes an econometric strategy based around using old subway system
extent to instrument for current subway system growth. An alternative is to use lagged changes of
population to instrument for current changes in subways. The basic logic of this approach is similar
to that described above. However, lagged population levels and changes have less ability to predict
current changes to subways than do lagged subway variables, so we organize our discussion and
analysis around the lagged subways instruments.
The instrumental variable strategy articulated above responds to the possibility that subway
construction reflects recent trends in population. A more direct approach to this problem is to
simply control for lagged population, which we also do in the results section.
A related problem arises if both population growth and subway growth reflect some unobserved city specific time-varying factor. For example, it may be that poor administrations cause
cities to grow slowly and build subway networks. In this case, our estimated effect of subways on
population growth confounds the effects of bad municipal government with the effects of subways.
To address this possibility, we would like to include fixed effects in the first differences regressions,
21 While

differencing solves one problem, it may create another. If k = 1 then both ∆sit−1 and ∆yit involve terms for
quantities for time t − 1. If we are concerned about contemporaneous correlation of errors in the population and subway
equations, then this creates an obvious problem. This is a classic problem in dynamic panel data and the conventional
approach is to substitute sit−2 for ∆sit−1 or to use longer lags.
22 We note that the instrumental variables strategy described here is related to the one proposed by Olley and Pakes
(1991), while the exogeneity condition of equation 7 is related to ideas developed in Arellano and Bond (1991).

25

or equivalently, city specific trend in the levels regressions, equations (4) and (5). To implement
this estimator, we second difference equation (4).23
Summarizing, our econometric investigation will be organized around estimating the following
system,
yit = A1 sit + A2 xit + A3 zi + ci + gi t + eit

(8)

sit = B1 sit−k + B2 xit + B3 zi + di + hi t + ηit .

(9)

This generalizes equations 4 and 5 in a number of ways. First, it allows for time-invariant control
variables, zi . Second, it allows for city specific trends and intercepts in both population and
subways equations. Third, it allows for time varying controls, lags of yi in particular. In practice,
we predict current changes in subways with 20 or 40 year old subway extent, so that k = 4 or 8.
B The problem of omitted variables
We are concerned that subway expansions and population growth are correlated with some unobservable. For example, one can imagine that cities experiencing bouts of growth-inhibiting
automobile congestion decide to build subways. If this is indeed the case, then we should observe
different effects of subways on population growth in congested than in uncongested cities. In
particular, we should observe that subway expansions in cities with low levels of congestion attract
population but that subway expansions in congested cities do not (or conversely). If we find no
heterogenous effects of subways by city congestion levels, this suggests that this particular omitted
variable is not biasing our estimations.
A second possibility is that the effect of subways on growth may be heterogenous across fixed
city characteristics. For example, subway expansions may attract population to cities that already
have a substantial subway network coverage, such as Paris or New York, but not to cities such
as Miami with small systems. We can test for this by looking for heterogenous effects by subway
network coverage. If we find no heterogenous effects by subway network coverage, we interpret
this as suggestive that this type of consideration is not leading to the null result.
More formally, we estimate the following regression
∆yit = A1 ∆sit + A2 (∆sit × xi ) + ∆eit

(10)

where xi denotes the terminal value of some control variable omitted from our main specification.24
The particular variables that we consider measure: topography; the terminal stock of roads; capital
23 In principle, one could also implement our instrumental variables strategy in second differences. We experimented
with this but found that lagged subways and population variables do not have much ability to predict current second
differences of subways. Consequently, these regressions were not informative.
24 We do not have a strong prior over whether or not the variable x should occur independently in this equation. It is
i
conventional that it should do so, however, since this is a first difference regression and since the xi ’s do not vary over
time, the first difference of a regression in levels that included an independent xi term would look like equation (10). As
a practical matter, we report estimates of equation (10), but corresponding estimates that include and independent term
in xi do not lead to important differences in our estimates of the effects of subways on population growth.

status; post wwii subway system indicator; degree of centralization; road congestion levels; and an
ease of doing business index, among others. The data sources and definitions for these variables
are described in the data appendix.

7. Subways and population: Main estimation results
We proceed by estimating successively more complete and complex versions of equations (8) and
(9). To begin, in table 5 we estimate equation (8) using OLS on pooled cross-sections. Such
estimations result in unbiased estimates only if the time invariant determinants of subways and
population are uncorrelated. This condition seems implausible. We expect that unobserved factors
affecting the attractiveness of a city also affect its construction of subways, so we regard these
estimations as primarily descriptive.
In column 1 of table 5 we regress the log of population on log of the count of operational subway
stations. We use the entire sample of 632 cities for which we have population and subway data.
Since our panel is complete for these two variables, we have a sample of 13 × 632 = 8,216 cityyears. The subway elasticity of population is large. A 10% increase in a city’s count of stations
is associated with a 4.8% increase in population. Column 2 replicates this result, but controls for
country level gdp and continent-by-year fixed effects, along with several time-invariant controls;
a capital city indicator, and distances to the ocean, international boundary and nearest navigable
river. We see that the coefficient on subways, while still large, decreases to 0.28. Our sample
size decreases to 7,374 in this regression, primarily because a number of the countries covered by
our sample, particularly those in the former Soviet Union, came into existence after 1950 and so
country level gdp is not available.
Column 3 considers the same regression as column 2 but restricts attention to cities that had
subways in 2010. This is the largest sample of cities that could possibly contribute to a first
differences estimate of the effect of subways. This reduces our sample to 1,565 city-years but leaves
the coefficient of subways almost unchanged. The sample of 137 cities used in column 3 includes
some cities that were small in 1950 and grew quickly to cross the 750,000 threshold for inclusion
in the un World Cities Data. To investigate the importance of this sampling problem in column
4 we restrict attention to cities that were already large in 1970 (above 1 million).25 The estimated
coefficient with the sample restricted to large cities changes very little. Columns 5 and 6 replicate
column 3, but consider alternative measures of subway extent, route kilometers and log subway
lines. Coefficient magnitudes change approximately in proportion to the changes in the standard
deviation of the subway measures.
Column 7 reports a regression similar to column 3, where our dependent variable is the logarithm of mean light intensity in a 25 km disk centered on the city. As in column 3, we restrict
25 We

experimented extensively with different sampling rules to investigate whether our results are driven by the
small cities that grow rapidly to get into the sample. We could find no evidence that this is the case.

attention to cities with subways in 2010. Our sample of city-years is smaller than for population
regressions because we have just four cross sections of lights data. We see that a one percent
increase in subways is associated with a 0.17 percent increase in lights. This is close to our results
for population and suggests that our population regressions are not driven by problems in the
un World Cities Data. In sum, table 5 confirms the conclusion of figure 3. Cities with more
subways tend to be bigger. This relationship is robust to controls, sampling, the particular measure
of subway extent and whether we measure city size with lights or population.
We now turn to first difference regressions. Table 6 presents first difference estimates of a
version of equation (8) without city specific trends. We note that both first difference and within es28

timators are consistent estimators for equation (8) if the errors, eit , in each period are not correlated
with the regressors in any period conditional on the unobserved fixed effect. Because our approach
to estimating equations (8) and (9) revolves around differencing, we prefer the first differences
estimator.26
Columns 3-6 in table 6 use the same sample of cities as column 3 of table 5, while columns
1 and 2 use the slightly larger sample available when we do not control for changes in gdp. In
column 1, we report the results of regressing change in log population on change in the log of the
count of operational stations. In column 2 we repeat this regression with continent specific year
dummies. Like table 4 we see a negative relationship between subway expansions and population
growth when we do not control for continent specific year effects, but that the relationship between
subways and population is approximately zero once we include these controls. In column 3 we add
controls for country level changes in gdp and population and in column 4 we restrict attention to
large cities in 1970 (over 1 million). In every case, we estimate the effect of subways to be less than
0.01 with standard errors around 0.003. These are tiny effects, precisely estimated. In unreported
results we estimate these same specifications separately for each continent and find virtually no
heterogeneity across continents, indicating that these small coefficients are not masking acrosscontinent heterogeneity.
In column 5 we control for our measure of bus ridership. We do this to address the following
concern. Suppose that in every year that a city does not invest in subways, it invests in buses, and
that buses and subways substitute perfectly for each other. In this case, years with subway expansions will be identical to years without, even though subways may be having an arbitrarily large
positive effect on population growth. Our data allows us to deal with this particular concern by
controlling for changes in bus ridership. Since the sample of cities and years for which we observe
bus ridership is much smaller than the sample for which we observe subways and population, our
sample of years and cities shrinks considerably. However, including this control does not lead to a
positive effect of subways on population. In fact, the relationship is slightly negative.
In columns 6 and 7 we measure subway extent using route km and counts of subway lines.
We still find very small and statistically insignificant effects. In column 8 we use the average
light intensity in a disk of 25km centered on the city as our dependent variable. As with our
other regressions, we find a much smaller effect than in the comparable cross-sectional regression,
column 7 of table 5, in this case not distinguishable from zero.
In column 9 we replicate column 3 but use 10 year rather than five year intervals to construct
our panel, while in column 10 we report a long difference regression where we conduct a crosssectional regression of long differences of population on long differences of subways. Both point
estimates are small negative numbers indistinguishable from zero at ordinary levels of confidence.
26 The choice between the two estimators hinges on subtle differences in the errors. The first difference estimator is
more efficient if eit is a random walk, while the within estimator is more efficient if the eit are i.i.d. (Ch. 10, Wooldridge
2001).

29

Columns 9 and 10 suggest that our first difference estimates are not an artifact of the frequency
with which we sample the data.27
Summing up, first difference estimates are dramatically smaller than cross-sectional estimates.
Not only are the estimates of the effect smaller than those in the cross-sectional estimates, but they
are small in an absolute sense, often well under 1% and precisely estimated.
We now investigate the possibility of confounding dynamics. Columns 1 and 2 of table 7
replicate column 3 of table 6 while controlling for the second and third lag of population change,
respectively. Our sample size drops slightly in these specifications because we observe lagged
population for fewer city years than contemporaneous population. Like the corresponding first
difference regression in table 6, these regressions indicate tiny and precisely estimated effects of
subways on population growth. Because the first lag of population is mechanically endogenous
in our first difference regressions, columns 1 and 2 of table 7 control for the second and third lags
of population. Column 3, instead reports second difference regressions. If there are city specific
trends, this regression will account for this. As in the first difference regressions, we see a tiny
precisely estimated relationship between subways and population.
In the remainder of table 7 we turn attention to the instrumental variables regressions described
in section 6. That is, we replicate the first difference regressions of columns 1 and 2, but use the
fourth or eighth lag of subways as an instrument for the current change in subways. The appendix
describes the first stage. As we see in appendix figure 1, subway systems grow predictably, and
at a decreasing rate. Thus, given the extent of a subway system in any period, we can forecast the
future, lower, growth rate quite accurately. This is demonstrated in table A.1 which presents first
stage results predicting current subway system growth rate as a function of lagged subway extent
and the controls that appear in the first two columns of table 7. We see that our instruments are not
weak, and behave as we would expect given the profile of system growth that we see in figures A.1
and A.2. Given that the instrument for subway growth in period t is subway extent 20 or 40 years
prior, our instrumented estimate provides a local average treatment effect for which identifying
variation is obtained from lower ranked expansions, as the instrument excludes variation from the
initial and usually highest priority subway stations. For example, subway stations built during the
first decade of a system are on average 6.4km from the city center, whereas this distance increases
to 7.6km and 8.5km in the second and third decades respectively.
In columns 4 and 5 of table 7 we replicate columns 1 and 2, but instrument for change in log
subways with the fourth lag of log subways. In column 6 we replicate column 1 but instrument
for change in subways with the eighth lag of log subways. The IV point estimates of the effect of
log subways are slightly larger than the first difference estimates, but never above 2% and never
27 In

fact, the long distance estimates are sensitive to the choice of time period. For example, if we conduct a
long difference regression from 1950-2010, we get a statistically significant positive relationship between subways and
population. This result is driven entirely by two cities which grew rapidly over the whole period and built large subway
systems between 2005 and 2010. Excluding these two cities restores a coefficient of about zero in this regression. For
this reason, we regard the long difference estimates as less reliable than other estimates.

30

statistically distinguishable from zero.28 As a robustness check, in column 7 we take the specification in column 4 but replace the control for lagged population growth with lagged population
level. This results in a negative but insignificantly different from zero instrumented coefficient of
subway expansions on city growth. The IV coefficient estimates are not uniformly positive and
suggest that the effect of subway expansions on city growth is small and not distinguishable from
zero. In sum, table 7 does not support the hypothesis that subways have a large positive effect on
population growth that is masked by some confounding dynamic process.
We next consider models that allow for a distributed lag structure in our data. In column 1 of
table 8, we replicate column 3 of table 6 and in columns 2-4 we substitute successively older lags of
change in subways for the current value. Like the effects of current subways, the effects of lagged
subways are tiny and precisely estimated. In column 5 we include the current change of subways
and three lags and see that coefficients are virtually identical to those we obtain when we include
subway variables one at a time. This suggests that our focus on the relationship between current
subway expansions and current population growth is not leading us to miss some longer term
effect of subways on population growth. These regressions also suggest that a subway expansion
does not affect current or future rates of population growth.
In table 9 we turn attention to the problem of omitted variables using the strategy described
in equation (10). In column 1 of table 9 we replicate the first difference regression from column 3
of table 6 for reference. In column 2 we include an interaction between subways and an indicator
for above median mean slope within 25km of the city center. If we think that cities build subways
when some topographical constraint on their development begins to bind, then we should expect
cities more subject to such topographical constraints to respond differently to changes in subways
than other cities. The results in column 2 do not support this intuition. Column 3 replicates column
2, but in place of the average slope, measures topographical constraints with the elevation range
within 25km of the city center. Like column 2, the results in column 3 do not suggest that subways
affect cities with difficult topography differently than flatter cities.
In column 4 we interact subway growth with an indicator for above median kilometers of highways in a 25km circle around the city. That the coefficients on the main effect and the interaction
are zero suggests that subway growth does not have a differential impact depending on whether
the city is well served by highways. In column 5 we include an interaction between an indicator
for above median traffic congestion and subways. If we think that cities tend to build subways as
traffic congestion begins to constrain their growth, then we should see congested and uncongested
28 Although point estimates from IV and first difference estimates of the effect of subways are not distinguishable from

zero at conventional levels, they are close, e.g., compare columns 2 and 5 of table 7. To the extent that IV estimates are
larger than the first difference estimates, they suggests that subways assigned to city-years by the equilibrium process
are assigned to city-years that are growing slightly more slowly than city-years selected at random.

Table 9: Robustness to confounding unobservables

cities respond differently to subways. Column 5 does not support this intuition.
In column 6 we include an interaction of subways with a capital city indicator. If we think, for
example, that capital cities are more likely to be the beneficiary of public expenditure than other
cities, then we might expect such spending to have a lower return in capital cities than elsewhere.
Column 6 does not support this intuition. In column 7 we interact an indicator of an index of
institutional quality with subways. If we think that a city’s response to subways depends on its
ability to reorganize private sector employment, then we might expect cities with a low score on
this index to respond differently to subways than those with a high score. The data also do not
support this idea.
In column 8 we interact subways with an indicator for whether the subway system predates the
second world war — the time when cars became ubiquitous. If we think that older cities are laid
out in a way that is more conducive to public transit, then we might expect to see such older cities
respond differently to subways than other cities. We do not. In column 9 we interact subways with
a measure of city centralization defined as the absolute value of the city light gradient in 1995. The
point estimate on main effect is positive and marginally significant at the 10% level and suggests
that subways have slightly larger effects on population in more decentralized cities — since the
interaction coefficient is negative and of about same magnitude.
Column 10 investigates whether the subway network extent is important. To accomplish this,
we calculate the share of all light within 25km of the center that is within 2km of a station. If
cities respond differently to subways that serve a larger fraction of their economic activity and
population, then we should expect to see a significant coefficient on the interaction of this variable
with subways. Our data do not support this intuition. Column 11 investigates whether cities that
were large in 1950 respond differently to subways. They do not. In column 12 we see that coastal
cities grow slightly less fast in response to subways than do other cities, but this effect is tiny.
Finally, in column 13 we ask whether cities with an effective bus network respond differently
to subways than those that do not. The data suggest that they do not. This is consistent with the
first difference regression in column 9 of table 6, where we see that controlling for bus ridership in
a first difference regression does not lead to a positive estimated effect of subways.
We have now presented five types of results, cross-sectional, first difference, IV, second difference and first differences including a variety of interaction effects. Consistent with descriptive
evidence presented in section 1, cross-sectional estimates are much larger than first differences
estimates. Results based on metropolitan area light intensity are qualitatively similar to those
based on population. Once we add continent specific year effects in column 3 of table 5 the
cross-sectional estimate of the effect of doubling subway stations is a 26% increase in population.
In first differences, the corresponding estimate is less than 1% and is indistinguishable from zero.
Our attempts to deal with confounding dynamics and with omitted variables do not change this
conclusion.
Broadly, formal econometric results support the conclusion suggested by the descriptive evi36

dence. That is, that big cities build subways and that these subways subsequently have little or no
effect on the population in these cities. Our most favorable IV regressions indicate that doubling
a subway system will increase population by less than 2%, although these estimates are never
distinguishable from zero and first difference estimates of the effect of subways on population are
often an order of magnitude smaller.

8. Subways and urban form
In this section, we use the lights data to investigate the relationship between urban centralization
and subway extent. We are interested in determining if the light gradient changes with subway
expansions. We follow our previous empirical approach using the light gradient and light intercept
in a city-year as our dependent variables. These variables describe, respectively, the rate at which
light decays with distance from the center, and brightness at the center.
More specifically, we regress our estimate of the light slope B and the intercept A in equation (3)
respectively for each city-year on a measure of subways using the various regression specifications
employed previously to analyze subways and population.
Table 10 reports our results. Panel (a) shows results using the light gradient B as the dependent
variable, while panel (b) shows results using A as the dependent variable. We first discuss panel (a)
at the top of the table. Column 1 shows the pooled OLS estimate. In the cross section, the elasticity
of light gradient to subway extent is 0.034. Given that the light gradient is negative, this indicates
that cities with larger subway systems have a flatter light gradient and are less centralized. Column
2 presents the first difference regression result in which we find an elasticity estimate of 0.023.
In column 3 we control for the second lag of population growth, and find virtually the same
coefficient as in column 2. Columns 4 and 5 present our instrumented first difference estimates and
show that we find a statistically significant elasticity of 0.060. We experimented with a number of
different indexes of centralization, for example, the ratio of light within 5km of the center to light
between 5 and 25km. Our estimates of the effects of subways on decentralization are broadly
similar across indexes.
The bottom part of the table, panel b, shows results using the light intercept A as the dependent
variable. Mean light at the origin is 12.1 log points and is 0.17 log points lower in cities with
subways (column 1). Column 2 shows the first difference regression result in which the elasticity
of light at the origin to subways is -0.20. Controlling for lagged population growth does not change
the estimated coefficient (column 3). Columns 4 and 5 show our instrumented estimates which are
also negative but larger and statistically significant at the 5% level in column 6 which controls for
lagged population growth. Taking together the results in panels (a) and (b) suggests that subways
decentralize activity (flatter light slopes and lower intercept) from the center to the peripheral areas
of the city, and are consistent with the absence of population growth documented in section 7.

37

These results allow us to reject the claim that subways lead to a concentration of activity in
the downtown core. While this may seem surprising, decentralization in response to a decrease
in transportation costs is an almost universal feature of theoretical descriptions of cities. It is also
consistent with established empirical results about the effects roads (Baum-Snow (2007), BaumSnow et al. (2017) and Garcia-López (2012)) and with Ahlfeldt and Wendland (2011) who find that
commuter rail contributes to the decentralization of Berlin. In our data, we observe that 72% of
subway cities have subway stations beyond 10 kilometers from the city center, and 16% of them
have stations beyond 25 kilometers. These statistics suggest that subways are built to have some
radial capacity that can contribute to decentralization.
One of the most robust findings of the literature using within city variation to study the effects
of subways. e.g., Gibbons and Machin (2005) and Billings (2011), is that economic activity becomes
relatively concentrated near subways. To confirm that this feature is present in our data, we
restricted attention to areas with 2km of a subway station and recalculated light density gradients
for each city on the basis of these areas. As expected, density declines much more slowly along
subway lines than it does along other rays out from the city center. That is, our lights data confirm
the main pattern seen in studies of subways that exploit within city variation.

9. Ridership
Previous literature has provided wide-ranging predictions about travel mode substitution patterns. For example, the Los Angeles subway expansion was opposed by groups representing
residents of poor neighborhoods under the argument that funding (and hence the supply) of buses
serving these neighborhoods would decrease as a consequence of large operating subsidies to the
subway (Grengs, 2002). If this argument holds in general, we should observe that bus ridership
decreases when subways expand. On the other hand, some authors have argued that overall public
transit ridership should be positively affected by subway expansions since buses and subways
complement each other in providing public transportation (c.f. Hensher, 2007). As an example
of why this would occur they point out that bus lines are redesigned after subway expansions to
feed passengers into the subway system. Under this argument bus ridership should increase when
subway systems expand. Finally, studies of rail expansions have argued that most subway users
were previously bus users (Baum Snow and Kahn, 2005), suggesting that the net effect on overall
ridership of rail expansions should be small.
Table 11 shows pooled cross sectional estimates relating subway extent to ridership. Cities with
larger subway systems have more transit riders (the elasticity is 0.90 in column 2). Similarly, cities
with larger subway systems have more subway riders (the elasticity in column 4 is 1.19) as well as
bus riders (the elasticity in column 6 is 0.61). As with Table 5, we view these pooled ols estimates
as mainly descriptive.

38

Table 12 presents our first difference estimations. In Column 3 we find that the total transit
ridership elasticity of subway extent is 0.68 (significant at the 5% level). This suggests that subway
expansions lead to increases in total transit ridership.
In columns 4-6 we show that subway ridership elasticity to subway extent is 0.61 and is distinguishable from zero. On the other hand, the effect of subway expansions on bus ridership is close to
zero in columns 7-9. This echoes Duranton and Turner (2011) who find that increase to the stock of
highway kilometers in a city lead to large increases in driving, and that only a little of this increase
reflects diversion of traffic from other roads. The results in columns 4-6 also suggest that subway
ridership increases less than proportionally with system extent (e.g., one-sided test p-value=0.044
for column 6). This is interesting for two reasons. First, it suggests that increases in subway extent
elicit smaller increases in ridership than the increases in driving that follow from increases in the
road network (Duranton and Turner, 2011). Second, it suggests that subway networks may be
subject to decreasing returns to scale. This is consistent with findings of decreasing returns to scale
in the road network in Couture, Duranton, and Turner (2018).

10. Discussion
A Subways and growth
On the basis of figure 3, it is natural to conjecture that subways are important for the growth of
cities. Our cross-sectional estimates support this conjecture. With 4.5 lines in an average system,
adding a subway line is about a 23% increase in system extent. Using our cross-sectional estimate
of the relationship between subway lines and population we have that a new subway is associated
with a population increase of about 12%.29 This is close to a back of the envelope calculation of the
population growth that would occur if a new subway line operated at capacity and all of its riders
migrated to the city because of the new subway line.30 Thus, if we compare the cross-sectional
estimates with the technical capabilities of subways, the cross-sectional estimates seem feasible,
but only barely.
Other estimation strategies tell a different story. Our first difference estimates suggest that
doubling the extent of a subway network causes at most a tiny increase in population. While these
estimates are consistent with patterns seen in the raw data, the possibility of confounding dynamics or omitted variables are obstacles to a causal interpretation of these estimates. To investigate the
table 5 column 6, the subway line elasticity of population is 0.52. Thus we have, 0.52 × 0.23 = 0.12.
car subway trains can carry about 35,000 people per hour (Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual
(1999)(ch. 1, part 1, p1-22), Transit Cooperative Research Program) or 87,500 over the course of a 2.5 hour morning
commute. Thus, a single new subway line could allow 87,500 new commuters to reach a central city. With a 50% labor
force participation rate such a migration could increase a city’s population by 175,000. This is 3.7% increase to the 4.7m
population of an average subway city in our sample. Since an average subway system has 57 stations and an average
subway line has 13.2 stations, adding a new subway line is a 23% increase in the extent of an average subway network.
Dividing, this suggests that doubling the extent of an average subway network could lead to a population increase of
about 0.037
0.23 × 100 = 16.1%.

possibility that subway expansions systematically occur in periods of low population growth, we
control for the recent history of population growth, conduct second difference and instrumental
variables estimates. These estimates also yield tiny elasticities. To investigate the role of omitted
variables we consider a large set of possible control variables. These estimates fail to find evidence
for a big hidden effect of subways on growth. The weight of evidence hence suggests that big cities
build subways, but that subways have at most a tiny effect on urban population growth.
B Subways and ridership
We also investigate the effect of subway expansions on transit ridership. Somewhat surprisingly,
we find that subway expansions do not decrease bus ridership. We also find that doubling the
extent of a subway network leads to about a 60% increase in ridership. Our estimates are precise
enough to allow us to reject the hypothesis of no-effect and also to reject the hypothesis of a 100%
effect. Thus, our point estimates are suggestive of a large ridership response to subway expansions,
and also of modest decreasing returns to subway extent.
To understand the relationship between our findings for ridership and population, we first calculate the number of immigrant subway commuters that would be required to completely account
for the increase in ridership associated with a subway expansion.31 This calculation suggests that
the increases in ridership that follow subway expansions are far too large to consist of immigrant
commuters. This suggests, in turn, that increases in ridership must primarily reflect an increase in
commute or non-commute trips by current residents.
C Subways and decentralization
Our investigation of the effect of subways on urban form finds that subway expansions cause cities
to spread out. Our first difference and IV estimations in table 10 indicate that a doubling of the
subway network causes the light density gradient to flatten by between 0.02 and 0.06. Using the
larger of these two estimates, we can calculate that a doubling of the subway network causes the
share of all light within 5km of the center to decrease by about 2.2% in an average city, holding
total light constant. At 13.2 stations per line and 57 stations per system, adding an average radial
subway line increases system capacity by about 23% and should lead to about 0.5% decrease in the
central share of a city’s light.
Although this decentralization effect is also seen for radial highways, the effect of subways
seems to be smaller. Baum-Snow (2007) finds that a single interstate highway causes about 9% of
the population of a us city to decentralize, while Baum-Snow et al. (2017) find that a radial highway
31 An average subway network serves about 377m riders per year. If a dedicated subway commuter rides the subway
twice per day, 250 days per year, then an average subway system could serve about 0.75m such commuters. This means
doubling the extent of a subway network would require about 0.6 × 0.75m = 0.45m new dedicated subway commuters.
With 50% labor force participation and average city population of 4.7m, if, hypothetically, new ridership resulting from
an expansion is provided by new migrants to the city who are dedicated subway commuters, then city population
would increase by about 19% in response to a doubling of system extent.

40

causes about 5% of the population of a Chinese city to decentralize. These effects are about 10 times
as large as those we find for subways. The relative size of the subway effect seems even smaller if
we compare the capacity of a subway line with that of a radial highway.32
To understand the relationship between our decentralization results and those for population
and ridership, suppose that changes in light are exactly proportional to changes in residential
population. In this case, doubling the extent of an average city’s subway network would lead to a
2.2% decrease in lights within 5km of the center. If changes in lights and changes in population are
perfectly proportional, this requires that about 94,000 people move in an average city with population 4.7m. Again assuming 50% labor force participation, this means moving 47,000 workers.
If all of these workers use the subway to commute to immobile jobs from their newly remote
residences, this subway induced decentralization will give rise to about 47,000 new dedicated
subway commuters.
We saw above that the increase in ridership that follows from a doubling of the subway network
could serve about 450,000 new dedicated subway commuters. Even under our extreme assumptions, this is about 10 times as many as are implied by the amount of decentralization. Thus, we
probably cannot account for the increase in ridership that follows a subway expansion with an
increase in commuting by newly decentralized existing residents.
Since we also cannot account for the increase in ridership with new city residents, we conjecture
that subways either displace other modes of transport while keeping travel constant, or induce
new trips by subway. The evidence provided in Gendron-Carrier et al (2017) that subways lead to
lower levels of pollution is consistent with this kind of transport mode substitution.

11. Conclusion
Subway expansions appear to have little or no effect on population growth, they lead to modest
increases in ridership, and they have small effects on the configuration of cities. New ridership is
unlikely to primarily consist of new commuters and subway expansions probably lead to increases
in aggregate city land rent that are small relative to construction costs. These results do not seem
to provide a basis for justifying the large subsidies that subway construction and operation often
requires.
While we have addressed the effects of subway expansion on population, urban form and
ridership, we have not addressed the effect of subway expansions on air pollution - although this
is taken up in a companion piece (Gendron-Carrier et al. 2017). With this said, our results so far
suggest that the evaluation of subway projects ought to rest on the demand for mobility, farebox
revenue, and not on the ability of subways to promote city growth.
32 As

we note in footnote 23, a subway line can carry about 35,000 people per hour at peak capacity. A limited access
highway lane carries about 2,200 cars per hour at peak capacity. Thus, a four lane radial highway consisting of two
lanes in each direction can carry about 4,400 cars per hour each way, about 12% of the capacity of a subway line (in the
US, interstate highways are most often two lanes in each direction).

Appendix: Supplemental results
While figure 1 shows the growth of the world’s subways, figure A.1 traces out the extent of
individual systems as a function of the time since they opened. Each marker in this figure describes
a city year, so that there is one marker for each of the city-years in our data where at least one
subway station is open. Consistent with figure 1, most of the observations are in the left portion
of the graph. This reflects the fact that many subways systems have opened in the past 30 years.
On the other hand, markers in the right hand portion of the graph describe the handful of subway
systems that date back to the 19th century. The solid line in the figure describes a locally weighted
regression of system extent on system age. This figure suggests that the expansion of a city’s
subway network is predictable. Expansion is rapid during the first 30-40 years after a system opens
and slows thereafter. Figure A.2 illustrates the variation that identifies our first stage regression
more explicitly. The horizontal axis is the fourth lag of log system extent and the vertical axis
is change in current log extent. The negative relationship we would expect from figure A.1 is
clear. Table A.1 presents our first stage regressions. These regressions show that the clear negative
relationship between lagged level and change that we see in figure A.2 is robust to the inclusion of
controls.

Digital elevation maps (DEM) were obtained from the publicly available Shuttle Radar Tomography Mission (NASA-SRTM). The DEM dataset contains elevation as well as land slope at
3 arc-second resolution (about 90 meters) worldwide. The mean slope was calculated within a 25
km disk around the city center. Cities were then partitioned at the median value of the average
slope to generate the interaction used in column 2.
The elevation range variable was defined using the SRTM DEM data as the maximum minus the
minimum value for terrain elevation within a 25km disk around the city center. Cities were then
partitioned at the median value of the elevation range to generate the interaction used in column
3.
Digital data on worldwide highways was obtained from ESRI’s roads and highways layer. We
used rank 1 roads (highways) and calculated total kilometers of roads within a 25km disk of a
city’s center. Cities were then partitioned at the median value of kilometers of highways in a city
to generate the interaction used in column 4.
Congestion

data

was

downloaded

from

TomTom

(http://www.tomtom.com/en_ca/

trafficindex/#/list, accessed July 2015) which ranks city traffic conditions in 219 major
cities worldwide. Cities were partitioned at the median value of congestion to generate the
interaction used in column 5.
Capital city refers to being a country capital. This variable was obtained from the UN cities
dataset.
For institutional quality we used the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking (http://www.
doingbusiness.org/rankings, accessed may 2013). The ‘Good for doing business’ variable used
in column 7 indicates that the country is among the top half for ease of doing business, which
means the regulatory environment is conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm. The
rankings are determined by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores on 10 topics, each
consisting of several indicators, giving equal weight to each topic.
The centralization variable used in column 9 is defined the absolute value of the city light
gradient in 1995. Larger values hence correspond more centralized cities.
The subway coverage variable used in column 10 is a measure of whether the subway system
in 1995 provided an above median coverage of total city lights. To create this variable, we first
defined 2km radius disks around subway stations operational in 1995. We then calculated the sum
of lights within the subway disks in 1995 and proceeded to take the ratio of this value to the sum of
lights in a 25km disk around the city center. Cities were partitioned at the median value of subway
coverage to generate the interaction used in column 10.

In column 11, a city was classified as coastal if its centroid is located within 20km of the ocean.
To provide a concrete example of this, Houston is the city closest to the limit of the cutoff for being
coastal using this definition.
