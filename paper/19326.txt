ABSTRACT
First, we propose a more efficient implementation of the Smolyak method for interpolation, namely,
we show how to avoid costly evaluations of repeated basis functions in the conventional Smolyak
formula. Second, we extend the Smolyak method to include anisotropic constructions; this allows
us to target higher quality of approximation in some dimensions than in others. Third, we show how
to effectively adapt the Smolyak hypercube to a solution domain of a given economic model. Finally,
we advocate the use of low-cost fixed-point iteration, instead of conventional time iteration. In the
context of one- and multi-agent growth models, we find that the proposed techniques lead to substantial
increases in accuracy and speed of a Smolyak-based projection method for solving dynamic economic
models.

Introduction

In a seminal paper, a Russian mathematician Sergey Smolyak (1963) proposes a sparse-grid
method that allows to e¢ ciently represent, integrate and interpolate functions on multidimensional hypercubes. The Smolyak method is not subject to the curse of dimensionality and can
be used to solve large-scale applications. A pioneering work of Krueger and Kubler (2004) introduces the Smolyak method to economics in the context of a projection-style iterative method
for solving multi-period overlapping generation models. The Smolyak methods are also used
to solve portfolio-choice problems (Gavilan-Gonzalez and Rojas (2009)); to develop state-space
…lters tractable in large-scale problems (Winschel and Krätzig (2010)); to solve models with in…nitely lived heterogenous agents (Malin et al. (2011), Gordon (2011), Brumm and Scheidegger
(2013)); and to solve new Keynesian models (Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2012)).
While the Smolyak method enables us to study far larger problems than do tensor-product
methods, its computational expense still grows rapidly with the dimensionality of the problem.
In particular, Krueger and Kubler (2004) and Malin et al. (2011) document a high computational cost of their solution methods when the number of state variables exceeds twenty. In
the paper, we show a more e¢ cient implementation of the Smolyak method that reduces its
computational expense, and we propose extensions of the Smolyak method that enable us to
more e¤ectively solve dynamic economic models.
First, the conventional Smolyak formula is ine¢ cient. To interpolate a function in a given
point, it …rst causes the computer to create and evaluate a long list of repeated basis functions,
and it then constructs linear combinations of such functions to get rid o¤ repetitions. In
high-dimensional problems, the number of repetitions is large and slows down computations
dramatically. We o¤er a way to avoid costly evaluations of the repeated basis functions: Instead
of conventional nested-set generators, we introduce disjoint-set generators. Nested sets include
one another, and as a result, their tensor products contain repeated elements but our disjoint
sets do not. This is why our implementation of the Smolyak formula does not have repetitions.1
An e¢ cient implementation of the Smolyak method is especially important in the context
of numerical methods for solving dynamic economic models which require us to interpolate
decision and value functions a very large number of times, e.g., in each grid point, integration
node or time period. We save on cost every time when we perform an evaluation of the Smolyak
interpolant.
To compute the interpolation coe¢ cients, we use a universal Lagrange interpolation technique instead of the conventional closed-form expressions. Namely, we proceed in three steps:
(i) construct M Smolyak grid points; (ii) construct M corresponding Smolyak basis functions;
and (iii) interpolate the values of the true function at the grid points using the basis functions.
We then solve a system of M linear equations with M unknowns. The cost of solving this
system can be high but it is a …xed cost in the context of iterative methods for solving dynamic
economic models. Namely, we argue that an expensive inverse in the Lagrange inverse problem
can be precomputed up-front (as it does not change along iterations). Furthermore, to ensure
numerical stability of a solution to the Lagrange inverse problem, we use families of orthogonal
basis functions, such as a Chebyshev family.

Our exposition was informed by our personal communication with Sergey Smolyak.

Second, the conventional Smolyak formula is symmetric in a sense that it has the same
number of grid points and basis functions for all variables. To increase the quality of approximation, one must equally increase the number of grid points and basis functions for all variables,
which may be costly or even infeasible in large-scale applications. In the paper, we present an
anisotropic version of the Smolyak method that allows for asymmetric treatments of variables,
namely, it enables us to separately choose the accuracy level for each dimension to increase
the quality of approximation. In economic applications, variables do not enter symmetrically:
decisions or value functions may have more curvature in some variables than in others; some
variables may have larger ranges of values than others; and …nally, some variables may be more
important than the others. For example, in heterogeneous-agent economies, an agent’s decision
functions may depend more on her own capital stock than on the capital stocks of other agents
(e.g., Kollmann et al. (2011)); or we may need more grid points for accurate approximation of
endogenous than exogenous state variables (e.g., models based on Tauchen and Hussy’s (1991)
approximation of shocks). An anisotropic version of the Smolyak method allows us to take into
account a speci…c structure of decision or value functions to solve the economic models more
e¢ ciently.
Third, the Smolyak method constructs grid points within a normalized multidimensional
hypercube. In economic applications, we must in addition specify how the model’s state variables are mapped into the Smolyak hypercube. The way in which this mapping is constructed
can dramatically a¤ect the e¤ective size of a solution domain, and hence, the quality of approximation. In the paper, we show how to e¤ectively adapt the Smolyak grid to a solution
domain of a given economic model. We speci…cally construct a parallelotope that encloses
a high-probability area of the state space of the given model, and we reduce the size of the
parallelotope to minimum by reorienting it with a principle-component transformation of state
variables. Judd et al. (2011) …nd that solution methods focusing on a relevant domain yield
a better …t inside such a domain than methods focusing on larger domains and facing a trade
o¤ between the …t inside and outside the relevant domain. For the same reason, an adaptive
domain increase the accuracy of the Smolyak method.
Finally, the Smolyak method for interpolation is just one ingredient of a numerical method
for solving dynamic economic models. In particular, Krueger and Kubler (2004) and Malin et
al. (2011) complemented Smolyak interpolation with other computational techniques that are
tractable in large-scale problems, such as Chebyshev polynomials, monomial integration and
learning-style procedure for …nding polynomial coe¢ cients. Nonetheless, there is one technique
–time iteration –that is expensive in their version of their numerical procedure. Time iteration
is traditionally used in dynamic programming: given functional forms for future value function,
it solves for current value function using a numerical solver. In works similarly in the context of
the Euler equation methods: given functional forms for future decision functions, it solves for
current decision functions using a numerical solver. However, there is a simple derivative-free
alternative to time iteration - …xed point iteration - that can solve large systems of equtions
rapidly using only straightforward calculations. In the present paper, we replace time iteration
used in the existing version of the Smolyak method with …xed-point iteration, avoiding thus
the need of a numerical solver.
We assess the performance of the Smolyak-based projection method in the context of one3

and multi-agent neoclassical stochastic growth models with up to 20 state variables. Our
analysis shows that there are substantial accuracy gains from using anisotropic grid and adaptive
domain even in the simplest case with two state variables: the maximum residuals in the
Euler equations can be reduced by 5-10 times compared to those produced by the baseline
isotropic Smolyak method with the standard hypercube domain (holding the number of the
coe¢ cients roughly the same). In multidimensional problems –the real interest of our analysis
– the accuracy gains from using an anisotropic grid and adaptive domain reach two orders
of magnitude in some examples. Our cost grows fairly slowly with the dimensionality of the
problem. In particular, our MATLAB code delivers a second-level Smolyak approximation to
a model with ten countries (twenty state variables) in about 45 minutes. For comparison,
the Fortran code of Malin et al. (2011), based on the conventional Smolyak method, solves
a similar model in about 10 hours. Moreover, we are able to produce a very accurate thirdlevel polynomial approximation to a ten-country model although such an approximation is
computationally demanding even for our e¢ cient implementation of the Smolyak method (our
running time increases to nearly 45 hours).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we illustrate the ine¢ ciency of the
conventional Smolyak formula. In Section 3, we introduce an alternative implementation of the
Smolyak method based on disjoint-set unidimensional generators and Lagrange interpolation.
In Sections 4.2 and 5, we develop versions of the Smolyak method with anisotropic grid and
adaptive domain, respectively. In Section 6, we assess the performance of the Smolyak-based
projection method in the context of one- and multi-agent growth models. Finally, in Section 7,
we conclude.

Conventional Smolyak method for interpolation

In this section, we describe the conventional Smolyak method for interpolation. In Section 2.1,
we outline the idea of the Smolyak method and review the related literature. In Sections 2.2, 2.3
and 2.4, we show how to construct the Smolyak grid points, Smolyak polynomial and Smolyak
interpolating coe¢ cients, respectively. Finally, in Section 2.5, we argue that the conventional
Smolyak method is ine¢ cient.

2.1

Smolyak method at glance

The problem of representing and interpolating multidimensional functions commonly arises in
economics. In particular, when solving dynamic economic models, one needs to represent and
interpolate decision functions and value functions in terms of state variables. With few state
variables, one can use tensor-product rules but such rules become intractable when the number
of state variables increases. For example, if we have …ve grid points for one variables, a tensor
product grid for d variables has 5d grid points, which is a large number even for moderately large
d. Bellman (1961) referred to the exponential growth in complexity as a curse of dimensionality.
In a seminal work, Smolyak (1963) introduces a numerical technique for representing multidimensional functions, which is tractable in problems with high dimensionality. The key idea of
the Smolyak’s (1963) analysis is that some elements produced by tensor-product rules are more
4

important for representing multidimensional functions than the others. The Smolyak method
orders all elements produced by a tensor-product rule by their potential importance for the
quality of approximation and selects a relatively small number of the most important elements.
A parameter, called a level of approximation, controls how many tensor-product elements are
included into the Smolyak grid. By increasing the level of approximation, one can add new
elements and improve the quality of approximation.2
Examples of Smolyak grids under approximation levels = 0, 1, 2, 3 are illustrated in
Figure 1 for the two-dimensional case. For comparison, we also show a tensor-product grid of
52 points.
Figure 1: Smolyak grids versus a tensor-product grid

In Table 1, we compare the number of points in the Smolyak grid and that in the tensorproduct grid with …ve grid points in each dimension. The number of points in a Smolyak grid

grows polynomially with the dimensionality d, meaning that the Smolyak method is not subject
to the curse of dimensionality. In particular, for = 1 and = 2, the number of the Smolyak
grid points grows as 1 + 2d and 1 + 4d + 4d (d 1), i.e., linearly and quadratically, respectively.
A relatively small number of points in Smolyak grids contrasts sharply with a huge number of
points in tensor-product grids in a high-dimensional case. Because of this, Smolyak grids are
also called sparse grids.
2

The level of approximation plays the same role in the Smolyak construction as the order of expansion in
the Taylor series, i.e., we include the terms up to a given order, and we neglect the remaining high-order terms.

To interpolate multidimensional functions o¤ the Smolyak grid, two broad classes of interpolants are used in mathematical literature. One class includes piecewise local basis functions;
see, e.g., Griebel (1998) and Bungartz and Griebel (2004) for related mathematical results,
and see Brumm and Scheidegger (2013) for an economic application. Piecewise functions are
very ‡exible and make it possible to vary the quality of approximations over di¤erent areas of
the state space as needed. However, the resulting approximations are non-smooth and nondi¤erentiable and also, they have a high computational expense (this interpolation technique is
still subject to the curse of dimensionality).
The other class of Smolyak interpolants includes global polynomial functions; see, e.g.,
Delvos (1982), Wasilkowski and Woźniakowski (1999) and Barthelmann et al. (2000) for a
mathematical background. Global polynomial approximations are smooth and continuously
di¤erentiable and also, they are relatively inexpensive. However, their ‡exibility and adaptivity
are limited. In economics, global polynomial approximation are used in Krueger and Kubler
(2004), Gavilan-Gonzalez and Rojas (2009), Winschel and Krätzig (2010), Gordon (2011),
Malin et al. (2011) and Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2012). In the present paper, we also
con…ne our attention to global polynomial approximations. Below, we show the conventional
Smolyak method for interpolation in line with Malin et al. (2011).

2.2

Construction of Smolyak grids using unidimensional nested sets

To construct a Smolyak grid, we generate unidimensional sets of grid points, construct tensor
products of unidimensional sets and select a subsets of grid points satisfying the Smolyak rule.
2.2.1

Unidimensional nested sets of points

The Smolyak construction begins with one dimension. To generate unidimensional grid points,
we use extrema of Chebyshev polynomials (also known as Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto points or
Clenshaw-Curtis points); see Appendix A. We do not use all consecutive extrema but those
that form a sequence S1 ; S2 ; ::: satisfying two conditions:
Condition 1. A set Si , i = 1; 2; :::, has m (i) = 2i 1 + 1 points for i 2 and m (1) 1.
Condition 2. Each subsequent set contains all points of the previous set, Si Si+1 . Such
sets are called nested.3
Below, we show the …rst four nested sets composed of extrema of Chebyshev polynomials:
i = 1 : S1 = f0g;
i = 2 : S2 = n
f 1; 0; 1g;

There are many other ways to construct sets of points that have a nested structure. For example, we can
use subsets of equidistant points; see Appendix A for a discussion. Gauss-Patterson points also lead to nested
sets, however, the number of points in such sets is di¤erent, namely, m (i) = 2i 1 1; see Patterson (1968), etc.

2.2.2

Tensor products of unidimensional nested sets of points

Next, we construct tensor products of unidimensional sets of points. As an illustration, we
consider a two-dimensional case with i = 1; 2; 3 in each dimension.

In Table 2, i1 and i2 are indices that correspond to dimensions one and two respectively; a
column Si1 and a row Si2 (see Si1 nSi2 ) show the sets of unidimensional elements that correspond
to dimensions one and two, respectively; ( ` ; n ) denotes a two-dimensional grid point obtained
by combining a grid point ` in dimension 1 and a grid point n in dimension two.
2.2.3

Smolyak sparse grids

Smolyak (1963) o¤ers a rule that tells us which tensor products must be selected from the table.
For the two-dimensional case, we must select tensor products (cells of Table 2) for which the
following condition is satis…ed:
d i1 + i2 d + ;
(1)
where 2 f0; 1; 2; :::g is the approximation level, and d is the dimensionality (in our case,
d = 2). In other words, the sum of a column i1 and a raw i2 , must be between d and d + .
Let Hd; denote a Smolyak grid for a problem with dimensionality d and approximation
level . Let us construct Smolyak grids for = 0, 1, 2 and d = 2 using the Smolyak rule (1).
If = 0, then 2 i1 + i2 2. The only cell that satis…es this restriction is i1 = 1 and
i2 = 1, so that the Smolyak grid has just one grid point,
H2;0 = f(0; 0)g :
7

(2)

If = 1, then 2 i1 + i2 3. The three cells that satisfy this restriction are (a) i1 = 1,
i2 = 1; (b) i1 = 1, i2 = 2; (c) i1 = 2, i2 = 1, and the corresponding …ve Smolyak grid
points are
H2;1 = f(0; 0) ; ( 1; 0) ; (1; 0) ; (0; 1) ; (0; 1)g :
(3)
If = 2, then 2 i1 + i2 4. There are six cells that satisfy this restriction: (a) i1 = 1,
i2 = 1; (b) i1 = 1, i2 = 2; (c) i1 = 2, i2 = 1; (d) i1 = 1, i2 = 3; (e) i1 = 2, i2 = 2; (f)
i1 = 3, i2 = 1, and there are thirteen Smolyak grid points,
H2;2 = ( 1; 1) ; (0; 1) ; (1; 1) ; ( 1; 0) ; (0; 0) ; (1; 0) ; ( 1; 1) ; (0; 1) ;

2.3

Smolyak formula for interpolation using unidimensional nested
sets

The conventional technique for constructing a Smolyak polynomial function also builds on
unidimensional nested sets and mimics the construction of a Smolyak grid.
2.3.1

Smolyak polynomial

Let fbd; denote a Smolyak polynomial function (interpolant) in dimension d, with approximation
level . The Smolyak interpolant is a linear combination of tensor-product operators pjij whose
indices jij satisfy a constraint jij i1 + ::: + id and is given by

where ( 1)d+ jij d+d 1jij is a counting coe¢ cient. For each jij satisfying max(d; + 1)

Closed-form expression for Smolyak interpolation coe¢ cients

There is a closed-form formula for the polynomial coe¢ cients in (5) if multidimensional Smolyak
grid points and basis functions are constructed using unidimensional Chebyshev polynomials
and their extrema, respectively; see Quarteroni et al. (2000) for a derivation of such formulas.
Consider a grid that has m (i1 ) ; :::; m (id ) grid points and basis functions in dimensions 1; :::; d,
respectively. Then, the corresponding coe¢ cients are given by

dimension is dropped from computation, i.e., m (id ) 1 is set to 1 and cjd = c1 is set to 1.

We must compute the coe¢ cients fb11 ; b21 ; b31 ; b12 ; b13 g so that polynomial function fb2;1 , given
by (13), matches true function f on Smolyak grid H2;1 given by (3). For

of Chebyshev polynomial basis are f 1 (x) ; 2 (x) ; 3 (x)g = f1; x; 2x

same polynomial basis for y, namely, f1; y; 2y 2 1g) and the extrema of Chebyshev polynomials
are f 1 ; 2 ; 3 g = f0; 1; 1g.

Note that to compute the coe¢ cients, we need to evaluate function f in …ve Smolyak grid
points of H2;1 .

2.5

Shortcomings of the conventional Smolyak method

The conventional Smolyak method using nested sets is ine¢ cient. First, it creates a list of
tensor products with many repeated elements and then, it eliminates the repetitions. In highdimensional applications, the number of repetitions is large and increases with both and d,
which leads to a considerable increase in computational expense.
Repetitions of grid points can be appreciated by looking at Table 2. For example, when
constructing H2;1 , we list a grid point (0; 0) in three di¤erent cells, and hence, we must eliminate
two grid points out of seven; when constructing H2;2 , we must eliminate twelve repeated points
out of twenty …ve points, etc. However, the repeated grid points are not a critical issue for the
computational expense. Grid points must be constructed just once, and it is not so important
if they are constructed e¢ ciently or not. It is a one-time …xed cost.
Unfortunately, the Smolyak formula (5) involves the same kind of repetitions, and it is not
a …xed cost. For example, fb2;1 , given by (13), lists seven basis functions f1g, f1; 2 (x) ; 3 (x)g
and f1; 2 (y) ; 3 (y)g in (8)–(10), respectively, and eliminates two repeated functions f1g by
assigning a weight ( 1) to pj2j ; furthermore, fb2;2 , derived in Appendix B, creates a list of twenty
…ve basis functions and removes twelve repeated basis function by assigning appropriate weights,
etc. We su¤er from repetitions every time we evaluate a Smolyak polynomial function. This is
an especially important issue in the context of numerical methods for solving dynamic economic
models, since we must interpolate decision and value functions in a very large number of points,
e.g., grid points, integration nodes and time periods. Moreover, we must repeat interpolation
each time when the decision and value functions change in the iterative cycle. The overall cost
of repetitions in the Smolyak formula can be very large.

E¢ cient implementation of the Smolyak method for
interpolation

We have argued that Smolyak (1963) sparse-grid structure is an e¢ cient choice for highdimensional interpolation. However, the existing implementation of the Smolyak method does
not arrive to this structure directly. Instead, it produces such a structure using a linear combinations of sets with repeated elements, which is ine¢ cient and expensive. In this section, we
propose a more e¢ cient implementation of the Smolyak method that avoids costly repetitions
of elements and arrives to the Smolyak structure directly. Our key novelty is to replace the conventional nested-set generators with equivalent disjoint-set generators. We use the disjoint-set
generators not only for constructing the Smolyak grids but also for constructing the Smolyak
basis functions; as a result, we do not make use of the conventional interpolation formula of
type (7). Furthermore, to identify the interpolating coe¢ cients, we use a canonical Lagrange
interpolation; thus, we also do not make use of formula (14) for the coe¢ cient. We …nd it
easiest to present our implementation of the Smolyak method starting from a description of the
Lagrange interpolation framework.

3.1

Multidimensional Lagrange interpolation

We consider the following interpolation problem. Let f : [ 1; 1]d ! R be a smooth function
de…ned on a normalized d-dimensional hypercube, and let fb( ; b) be a polynomial function of
the form
M
X
bn n (x) ;
(15)
fb(x; b) =
n=1

d

where n : [ 1; 1] ! R, n = 1; :::; M , are d-dimensional basis functions, and b (b1 ; :::; bM ) is
a coe¢ cient vector.
We construct a set of M grid points fx1 ; :::; xM g in [ 1; 1]d , and we compute b so that the
true function, f , and its approximation, fb( ; b) coincide in all grid points:
3 2
3

3 2
3 2
1 (x1 )
M (x1 )
f (x1 )
fb(x1 ; b)

5=4
5=6
(16)

4
b
bM
f (xM )
f (xM ; b)
1 (xM )
M (xM )

Approximation fb( ; b) is used to interpolate (infer, reconstruct) f in any point x 2 [ 1; 1]d .
To implement the above interpolation method, we must perform three steps:
(i) Choose M grid points fx1 ; :::; xM g.
(ii) Choose M basis functions for forming fb(x; b).
(iii) Compute b that makes f and fb( ; b) coincide in all grid points.
Lagrange interpolation allows for many di¤erent choices of grid points and basis functions.
We will use grid points and basis functions produced by the Smolyak method. In Section 3.2,
we construct the Smolyak grid points; in Section 3.3, we produce the Smolyak basis functions;
12

in Section 3.4, we identify the interpolation coe¢ cients; in Section 3.5, we compare our implementation of the Smolyak method with the conventional implementation described in Section
2; and …nally, in Section 3.6, we show an e¢ cient formula for Smolyak interpolation.

3.2

Construction of Smolyak grids using unidimensional disjoint sets

To construct a Smolyak grid, we proceed as in the conventional Smolyak method, namely, we
produce sets of unidimensional grid points, compute tensor products of such sets and select an
appropriate subsets of tensor-product elements for constructing a multidimensional grid. The
di¤erence is that we operate with unidimensional disjoint sets instead of unidimensional nested
sets. This allows us to avoid repetitions of grid points.
3.2.1

Unidimensional disjoint sets of grid points

Let us de…ne a sequence of disjoint sets A1 ; A2 ; ::: using the sequence of nested sets S1 ; S2 ; ::: of
Section 2.2.1 such that A1 = S1 and Ai = Si nSi 1 for i 2:
i = 1 : A1 = f0g;
i = 2 : A2 = n
f 1; 1g;o
i = 3 : A3 = p12 ; p12 ;
p p
p p p p p p
2+ 2
2
2
2
2
2+ 2
i = 4 : A4 =
;
; 2 ; 2
.
2
2
By de…nition, Ai is a set of points in Si but not in Si 1 . The constructed sets are disjoint,
Ai \ Aj = f?g for any i 6= j and their unions satisfy A1 [ ::: [ Ai = Si . The number of elements
in Ai is m (i) m (i 1) = 2i 2 points for i 3, and the number of elements in A1 and A2 is
1 and 2, respectively.
3.2.2

Tensor products of unidimensional disjoint sets of points

Next, we construct tensor products of disjoint sets of unidimensional grid points. Again, we
consider the two-dimensional case, with i = 1; 2; 3 in each dimension.
In Table 3, indices i1 and i2 are indices that correspond to dimensions one and two, respectively; a column Ai1 and a row Ai2 (see Ai1 nAi2 ) show the sets of unidimensional elements that
correspond to dimensions one and two, respectively; ( ` ; n ) denotes a two-dimensional grid
point obtained by combining a grid point ` in dimension 1 and a grid point n in dimension
two. Thus, the table shows incremental grid points, and we can easily see which grid points are
added when we increase the approximation level.
3.2.3

Smolyak sparse grids

We use the same Smolyak rule (1) for constructing multidimensional grid points. That is, we
select elements that belong to the cells in Table 3 for which the sum of indices of a column and
a row, i1 + i2 , is between d and d + . This leads to the same Smolyak grids H2;0 , H2;1 and
H2;2 as shown in (2), (3), and (4), respectively. However, in our case, no grid point is repeated

H2;0 H2;1 H2;2 even though their unidimensional generators are disjoint (not nested).

3.3

Construction of Smolyak polynomials using unidimensional disjoint sets

Our construction of Smolyak polynomials parallels our construction of Smolyak grids using unidimensional disjoint sets. To be speci…c, we produce disjoint sets of unidimensional basis functions, compute tensor products of such sets and select an appropriate subset of tensor-product
elements for constructing a multidimensional polynomial function. Again, using disjoint-set
generators instead of nested-set generators allows us to avoid repetitions of basis functions.
3.3.1

Unidimensional disjoint sets of basis functions

We …rst construct disjoint sets A1 ; :::; Ai ; ::: that contain unidimensional basis functions:
i = 1 : A1 = f1g;
i = 2 : A2 = f 2 (x) ; 3 (x)g;
i = 3 : A3 = f 4 (x) ; 5 (x)g.
i = 4 : A3 = f 6 (x) ; 7 (x) ; 8 (x) ; 9 (x)g.
3.3.2

Tensor products of unidimensional disjoint sets of basis functions

We next construct the two-dimensional basis functions using tensor products of unidimensional
basis functions.
By construction, all elements in Table 4 appear just once and therefore, are non-repeated.
Note that Table 4 looks exactly like Table 3.

Smolyak polynomial basis functions

We apply the same Smolyak rule (1) to produce a list of basis function as we used for producing
grid points. Let P d; denote a Smolyak basis function with dimensionality d and approximation
level .
If = 0, then 2 i1 + i2 2. The only cell that satis…es this restriction is i1 = 1 and
i2 = 1, so that the set of Smolyak basis functions has just one element
P 2;0 = f1g :

(17)

If = 1, then 2 i1 + i2 3. The three cells that satisfy this restriction are (a) i1 = 1,
i2 = 1; (b) i1 = 1, i2 = 2; (c) i1 = 2, i2 = 1, and the corresponding …ve Smolyak basis
functions are
P 2;1 = f1; 2 (x) ; 3 (x) ; 2 (y) ; 3 (y)g :
(18)
If = 2, then 2 i1 + i2 4. There are six cells that satisfy this restriction: (a) i1 = 1,
i2 = 1; (b) i1 = 1, i2 = 2; (c) i1 = 2, i2 = 1; (d) i1 = 1, i2 = 3; (e) i1 = 2, i2 = 2; (f)
i1 = 3, i2 = 1, and there are thirteen Smolyak basis functions
P 2;2 = f1;

The sets of Smolyak basis functions P 2;0 , P 2;1 and P 2;2 de…ned in (17), (18), and (19)
correspond to grids H2;0 , H2;1 and H2;2 de…ned in (2), (3), and (4), respectively. To form
a Smolyak polynomial function under our construction, one just need to use the elements
satisfying condition (1) since no element is repeated in Table 4 by construction.

3.4

Construction of Smolyak coe¢ cients using Lagrange interpolation

Recall that b`1 :::`d ’s in (5) must be constructed so that the Smolyak polynomial fbd; matches the
true function f on the Smolyak grid Hd; . We construct the Smolyak interpolating coe¢ cients
solving the inverse problem (16) numerically.
3.4.1

Solution to the inverse problem

Provided that the matrix of basis functions in the right side of (16) has full rank, we obtain a
system of M linear equations with M unknowns that admits a unique solution for b :

By construction, the approximating polynomial fb coincides with the true function f in all grid
points, i.e., fb(xn ; b) = f (xn ) for all xn 2 fx1 ; :::; xM g.
3.4.2

Example of interpolation coe¢ cients under d = 2 and

= 1 revisited

Let us now construct the Smolyak polynomial coe¢ cients under d = 2 and = 1 by solving the
inverse problem as shown in (20). We again use unidimensional Chebyshev polynomials and
extrema of Chebyshev polynomials. As follows from (18), the Smolyak polynomial function is
given by
fb(x; y; b) b11 1 + b21 x + b31 2x2 1 + b12 y + b13 2y 2 1 ;
(21)

where b (b11 ; b21 ; b31 ; b12 ; b13 ) is a vector of …ve unknown coe¢ cients on …ve basis functions. We
identify the coe¢ cients such that the approximation fb(x; y; b) matches the true function f (x; y)
in …ve Smolyak grid points distinguished in (3), namely, f(0; 0) ; ( 1; 0) ; (1; 0) ; (0; 1) ; (0; 1)g.
This yields a system of linear equations Bb = w, where

Comparison to the conventional Smolyak method

We compare our implementation of the Smolyak method with the conventional implementation
described in Section 2. First, we quantify the reduction in cost of the Smolyak interpolant
evaluation that we achieve by avoiding the repetitions and then, we compare the Lagrange
interpolation method with explicit formulas for the interpolating coe¢ cients.
3.5.1

Nested-set versus disjoint-set constructions of the Smolyak interpolant

First, consider the conventional construction of the Smolyak polynomial in (5) based on unidimensional nested sets; see Section 2.3.1. By (5), the number of terms which we list to evaluate
d
Y
P
fbd; is
m (ij ). Note that the counting coe¢ cient ( 1)d+ jij d+d 1jij is not
max(d; +1) jij d+ j=1

relevant for computation of the number of terms because it does not add new terms but only
counts the number of repetitions to be cancelled out.
Second, consider our alternative construction of the Smolyak polynomial function based on
unidimensional disjoint sets; see Section 3.3. The number of basis functions in P d; is equal to
d
P Y
[m (ij ) m (ij 1)]. To assess the di¤erence in costs between the two constructions,
d jij d+ j=1

we consider the ratio of the number of terms under the two constructions:

In Figure 2, we represent the ratio Rd; for 1 d 30 and 0
5.The higher is the level
of approximation, the larger are the savings due to more e¢ cient evaluation of the Smolyak
interpolant. In particular, under = 1 the conventional nested-set construction of the Smolyak
interpolant is 40 percent more expensive than our construction, while under = 6, it is more
than 700 percent more expensive than ours. We shall emphasize that our construction saves on
cost every time when the Smolyak interpolant is evaluated, i.e., in every grid point, integration
node or time period.
Some qualitative assessment of Rd; can be derived for the case when max(d; + 1) = d
(this is the most relevant case for high-dimensional problems in which high-order polynomial

Analytical expression for interpolation coe¢ cients versus numerical Lagrange
interpolation

The Lagrange interpolation method is universal: it can be applied to any sets of grid points
and basis functions provided that the inverse problem (20) is well-de…ned (the matrix of basis
functions evaluated in grid points has full rank). In turn, the formula of type (14) is a special
case of Lagrange interpolation in which the solution to the inverse problem can be derived in
a closed form. The numerical implementation of Lagrange interpolation using (20) has two
potential shortcomings compared to the closed-form expression: …rst, it can be numerically
unstable and second, it can be expensive.
To attain numerical stability, we must use families of grid points and basis functions that
do not lead to ill-conditioned inverse problems. Chebyshev polynomials and their extrema are
one example but many other choices are possible.4
To reduce the computational expense, we use the following precomputation technique in the
context of numerical algorithm for solving dynamic economic models. We compute the inverse
of the matrix of basis functions in (20) at the initialization stage, before entering the main
iterative cycle. In this way, the expensive part of Lagrange interpolation becomes a …xed cost.
In the main iterative cycle, computing the interpolation coe¢ cients requires only inexpensive
matrix multiplications, which can be easily parallelized for a further reduction in cost if needed.
This precomputation technique allows us to reconstruct the polynomial coe¢ cients at a low cost
each time when decision and value functions change along iterations.5

Smolyak formula for interpolation revisited

It is relatively straightforward to write a computer code that automates the construction of the
Smolyak interpolant under our disjoint-set generators described in Section 3.3. We just have
to sum up all the basis functions that appear in the table like Table 4 since no basis function
is repeated by construction. Nonetheless, we were also able to derive a formula for Smolyak
interpolation using disjoint sets, which is parallel to the conventional formula (5) using nested
sets. We show such a formula below.
3.6.1

Smolyak polynomial: e¢ cient construction

The formula for constructing a Smolyak polynomial function using unidimensional disjoint sets
is as follows:
X
fbd; (x1 ; :::; xd ; b) =
q jij (x1 ; :::; xd ) ;
(25)
d jij d+

for each jij satisfying d

d + , a tensor-product operator pjij (x1 ; :::; xd ) is de…ned as
X
q jij (x1 ; :::; xd ) =
q i1 ;:::;id (x1 ; :::; xd ) ;
(26)
jij

i1 +:::+id =jij

and q i1 ;:::;id (x1 ; :::; xd ) is de…ned as
m(i1 )

q

i1 ;:::;id

(x1 ; :::; xd ) =

`1 =m(i1 1)+1

m(id )

X

:::

b`1 :::`d

`1

(x1 )

`d

(xd ) ;

(27)

`d =m(id 1)+1

where `1 (x1 ) ; :::; `d (xd ) are unidimensional basis functions, in dimensions 1; :::; d, respectively; `1 (x1 )
`d (xd ) is a d-dimensional basis function; `d = 1; :::; m (id ); b`1 :::`d are coe¢ cients vectors. We use the convention that m (0) = 0 and m (1) = 1. By construction of (27),
there are no repeated terms across di¤erent q i1 ;:::;id ’s.
Formula (25) sums up all the terms in Table 4 (recall that all the sets in Table 4 are
disjoint and basis functions are never repeated by construction). The economization from our
more e¢ cient alternative Smolyak formula is described by (24) and is shown in Figure 2. To
compute coe¢ cients b`1 :::`d ’s, we can use either the conventional closed-form expression (14) or
a numerical solution (20) to the Lagrange interpolation problem.
3.6.2

Example of Smolyak polynomial under d = 2 and

= 1 revisited

We now illustrate the construction of Smolyak polynomial function (25) by revisiting an example
with d = 2 and = 1 studied in Section 2.3.2 (in Appendix B, we also show the construction
of such a function with d = 2 and = 2).
For the case of = 1, we have i1 + i2 3. This restriction is satis…ed in three cases: (a)

19

i1 = i2 = 1; (b) i1 = 1, i2 = 2; (c) i1 = 2, i2 = 1. Thus, using (27), we obtain

This formula coincides with (13). Thus, we obtain the same Smolyak polynomial function as
the one produced by the conventional Smolyak formula but we avoid forming lists of repeated
basis functions.

Anisotropic Smolyak method

In economic applications, variables often enter assymetically in decision functions or value
functions. For example, in a heterogeneous-agent economy studied in Kollmann et al. (2011),
the individual choices depend more on her own variables than on variables of other agents; and
the literature, based on Tauchen and Hussy’s (1991) discretizations uses many grid points for
endogenous state variables and few grid points for exogenous state variables.
However, the Smolyak method, studied in Sections 2 and 3, treats all dimensions equally in
the sense that it uses the same number of grid points and basis functions for all variables. To
increase the quality of approximation under such a method, we must equally increase the number
of grid points and basis functions in all dimensions. This may be too costly to do in large-scale
applications. An alternative is to increase the number of grid points and basis functions only
in those dimensions that are most important for the overall quality of approximation. In this
section, we show a variant of the Smolyak method that allows for a di¤erential treatment of
variables, speci…cally, it enables us to separately choose accuracy levels for each dimension by
taking into account a speci…c structure of decision functions in a given economic model. We
refer to such a method as a Smolyak method with anisotropic grid.
20

4.1

De…nition of anisotropy

The term anisotropic comes from mathematical literature and refers to functions that are
"asymmetric" in some respect, for example, have more curvature in some variables than in
others, or have a larger range in some variables than in others. Gerstner and Griebel (2003)
propose dimension-adaptive grids for numerical integration of multivariate anisotropic functions; see also Bungartz and Griebel (2004) and Garcke (2011).
The above literature uses very ‡exible piecewise linear basis functions which allows for consecutive re…nements of the solution in those areas in which higher accuracy is needed (though at
a high computational expense). Our method, based on a global polynomial approximation, is
less ‡exible, and the possibility of re…nement is limited to speci…c dimensions. Our implementation of the anisotropic construction and the error bounds are therefore di¤erent from those
in the literature that uses piecewise basis functions.
As a starting point, consider a standard (isotropic) Smolyak grid with a degree of approximation as de…ned in Sections 2 and 3. Observe that for each dimension j = 1; :::; d, index ij
varies from 1 to + 1. For example, in Table 2, i1 and i2 vary from 1 to 3, and varies from
0 to 2, respectively (i.e., is equal to the maximum ij , j = 1; :::; d, minus 1).
For the anisotropic case, let us denote by j an approximation level in dimension j. If in a
1. A
, then j = imax
, i.e., ij = 1; :::; imax
dimension j, the maximum index admitted is imax
j
j
j
Smolyak grid is called anisotropic if there is at least one dimension j such that j 6= k for all
k 6= j; otherwise, it is called isotropic. We denote an anisotropic Smolyak grid, Smolyak basis
functions and Smolyak interpolant as Hd;( 1 ;:::; d ) , P d;( 1 ;:::; d ) and fbd;( 1 ;:::; d ) , respectively.

4.2

Anisotropic Smolyak grid

Our design of an anisotropic variant of the Smolyak method parallels the design of the isotropic
Smolyak method described in Sections 3. Namely, we …rst produce an anisotropic Smolyak
grid, we then produce an anisotropic Smolyak polynomial function, and we …nally compute
polynomial coe¢ cients using Lagrange interpolation. Our anisotropic construction also builds
on disjoint-set generators, which allows us to avoid costly repetitions of elements in the Smolyak
interpolant.
4.2.1

Tensor products of unidimensional sets of points

The two-dimensional tensor products constructed from the unidimensional sets up to i = 4 and
i = 2 in the dimensions x and y, respectively are summarized in Table 5. By construction, the
table contains only non-repeated elements.
4.2.2

Smolyak sets of multidimensional elements under anisotropic construction

The Smolyak rule tells us which tensor products must be selected. For the two-dimensional
case, it is as follows: Select elements that belong to the cells in Table 5 for which the following

where max max f 1 ; 2 g is a maximum of the level of approximation across the two dimensions, and the dimensionality is d = 2. In other words, the sum of indices of a column and a

Let us construct examples of Smolyak anisotropic grids using the anisotropic version of the
Smolyak rule (34).
If ( 1 ; 2 ) = (1; 0), then max = 1 and the anisotropic Smolyak rule implies 2 i1 +i2 3,
i1 2 and i2 1. The three cells that satisfy this restriction are (a) i1 = 1, i2 = 1; (b)

(36)

If ( 1 ; 2 ) = (2; 1), then max = 2 and 2 i1 + i2 4, i1 3 and i2 2. There are …ve
cells that satisfy this restriction (a) i1 = 1, i2 = 1; (b) i1 = 1, i2 = 2; (c) i1 = 2, i2 = 1;
(d) i1 = 1, i2 = 3; (e) i1 = 2, i2 = 2; and there are eleven Smolyak grid points
H2;(2;1) = ( 1; 1) ; (0; 1) ; (1; 1) ; ( 1; 0) ; (0; 0) ; (1; 0) ; ( 1; 1) ; (0; 1) ;

The three Smolyak anisotropic grids constructed in the above two-dimensional example are
shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Examples of Smolyak anisotropic grids

We do not elaborate the construction of the anisotropic Smolyak polynomial function because such a construction trivially repeats the construction of grid points. Furthermore, to …nd
the interpolation coe¢ cients, we use the Lagrange interpolation approach described in Section
3.4, which applies to anisotropic construction without changes. Finally, we can adapt Smolyak
interpolation formula (25) to the anisotropic case by imposing restrictions on i1 ; :::; id .

4.3

Advantages of anisotropic Smolyak method

The anisotropic class of methods involves a trade-o¤: from one side, reducing a number of grid
points and basis functions, reduces the computational expense but from the other side, it also
reduces the quality of approximation. This trade-o¤ suggests that anisotropic methods must
be used when the former e¤ect overweighs the latter. Using anisotropic methods in practice
would require us either to have certain knowledge of function that we want to interpolate or
to do some experimentation. Namely, we can keep adding or removing grid points and basis
functions in di¤erent dimensions until the target level of accuracy is attained. Maliar et al.
(2013) provide the error bounds for the Smolyak anisotropic constructions.
Let us compare the number of elements in an isotropic Smolyak grid Hd; with the number
of elements in an anisotropic Smolyak grid Hd;( 1 ;:::; d ) ; we assume that = max f 1 ; :::; d g;

The above ratio depends on the speci…c assumption about the approximation level in each
dimension ( 1 ; :::; d ). Let us assume that the true function is completely ‡at in all dimensions
except of dimension 1. To accurately approximate such a function, we can use an anisotropic
Smolyak method in which 1 = in dimension 1 and j = 0 for all other dimensions, j = 2; :::; d.
In Figure 4, we show the corresponding ratio of the number of points under isotropic and
anisotropic versions of the Smolyak method.

In this example, the savings are very large when d and are large. For example, when d = 5
and = 5, the number of grid points and basis functions is reduced by nearly two orders of
magnitude. This is an extreme example which shows maximum possible gains from anisotropy.
In empirically relevant examples, the gains from anisotropic constructions can vary depending
on the anisotropy of speci…c decision or value functions in economic models.

Smolyak method with adaptive domain

The Smolyak construction tells us how to represent and interpolate functions de…ned on a normalized d-dimensional hypercube. However, the solution domain of a typical dynamic economic
model does not have the shape of a hypercube but can be a set of any shape in a d-dimensional
24

space. We now describe how to e¤ectively adapt a multidimensional Smolyak hypercube to an
unstructured solution domain of a given economic model.

5.1

Adaptive parallelotope

The ergodic set (i.e., the support of the ergodic distribution) of a dynamic economic model
can have any shape in a d-dimensional space. It may be even an unbounded set such as Rd+ .
We must …rst construct a d-dimensional parallelotope to enclose the relevant area of the state
space of the studied model, typically, a high-probability area of the ergodic set. We must then
match the parallelotope to a normalized hypercube [ 1; 1]d used by the Smolyak method.
As an example, in Figure 5, we plot a simulation of 10,000 observations for capital and
productivity level in a representative-agent neoclassical stochastic growth model with a closedform solution (see Section 6.1 for a detailed description of this model).
We show two possible rectangulars in the …gure that enclose a given set of simulated point:
one is a conventional rectangular in the original coordinates, and the other is a rectangular
obtained after a change of variables (both rectangulars are minimized subject to including all
simulated points).

Our example shows that the way in which the rectangular is adapted to the state space of
an economic model can matter a lot for the size of the resulting rectangular. How much the
rectangular can be reduced by changing the system of coordinates will depend on the shape of
the high-probability set. In particular, all rectangulars will have the same size when simulated
data are of a shape of a perfect sphere, however, the reduction in size can be fairly large if such
the high-probability set is inclined (as is shown in the …gure). The reduction in size can be
especially large in problems with high dimensionality.

25

5.2

Smolyak grid on principal components

There are many ways to match a parallelotope into a normalized hypercube in the context
of the Smolyak method. We propose an approach that relies on a principle component (PC)
transformation and that is convenient to use in economic applications. Namely, we …rst use
simulation to determine the high-probability area of the model’s state space (for a su¢ ciently
accurate initial guess), and we then build a parallelotope surrounding the cloud of simulated
points.
Let X
x1 ; :::; xL 2 RT L be a set of simulated data, i.e., we have T observations
on L variables. Let the variables x1 ; :::; xL be normalized to zero mean and unit variance.
Consider the singular value decomposition of X, de…ned as X = U SV > , where U 2 RT L and
V 2 RL L are orthogonal matrices, and S 2 RL L is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries
s1 s2 ::: sL 0, called singular values of X. Perform a linear transformation of X using
the matrix of singular vectors V as follows: Z
XV , where Z = z 1 ; :::; z L 2 RT L . The
1
L
variables z ; :::; z are called principal components of X, and are orthogonal (uncorrelated),
0 >
>
z ` z ` = 0 for any `0 6= ` and z ` z ` = s2` . The sample variance of z ` is s2` =T , and, thus, z 1
and z L have the largest and smallest sample variances, respectively.
In Figure 6, we illustrate the four steps of construction of the adaptive parallelotope using
PCs.

we show 13 Smolyak points with the approximation level = 2 for the principal components of
the data. Finally, in Panel 4, we plot the corresponding 13 Smolyak points for the original data
26

after computing an inverse PC transformation. In Appendix D, we provide additional details
on how to construct the rectangular domains for this particular example.

5.3

Advantages of adaptive domain

The size of a parallelotope on which a function is approximated is translated into either higher
quality or lower costs of the resulting approximation. For a …xed cost of approximation (i.e., for
a given approximation level of the Smolyak method), …tting a polynomial on the relevant domain
gives us a better …t inside of such a domain than would give us an otherwise identical method
that solves a problem on a large domain and that faces a trade-o¤ between the …t inside and
outside the relevant domain. In turn, to attain a given quality of approximation in the relevant
domain, we need a more expensive approximation characterized by a higher approximation level
if we solve the model on a larger domain than on a smaller domain. Finally, we remark that
we can combine asymmetric treatment of variables with an adaptive domain. This could be a
potentially useful extension for some applications but we do not pursue it in the present paper.

Smolyak method for solving dynamic economic models

The Smolyak method for interpolation is just one speci…c ingredient of a method for solving dynamic economic models. We need to complement it with other ingredients, such as a procedure
for approximation of integrals, a procedure that solves for …xed point coe¢ cients, a procedure
that updates the functions along iterations, a procedure that maps the state space of a given
economic model into the Smolyak hypercube, etc. In this section, we incorporate the Smolyak
method for interpolation into a projection methods for solving dynamic economic models. We
assess the performance of the studied Smolyak-based solution method in the context of oneand multi-agent growth models.

6.1

(40)

where ct ; kt+1
0, and k0 and 0 are given. Here, ct and kt are consumption and capital,
respectively; 2 (0; 1) is the discount factor; u(ct ) is the utility function, which is assumed
to be increasing and concave;
2 (0; 1] is the depreciation rate of capital; f (kt ; t ) is the
production function with 2 (0; 1) being the capital share in production; and Et is the operator
of expectation conditional on state (kt ; t ). The productivity level t in (40) follows a …rst-order
autoregressive process with 2 ( 1; 1) and > 0.
27

6.2

Time iteration versus …xed-point iteration

Our implementation of the Smolyak method also di¤ers from the one in Krueger and Kubler
(2004) and Malin et al. (2011) in the technique that we use to iterate on decision functions.
Speci…cally, they use time iteration that solves a system of non-linear equations using a numerical solver, whereas we use derivative-free …xed-point iteration that does so using only
straightforward calculations. As an illustration, suppose we need to solve a non-linear equation
f (x) = x; then time iteration …nds min jf (x) xj using a solver, while …xed-point iteration
x

constructs a sequence like x(i+1) = f (x(i) ), i = 0; 1; :::, starting from some initial guess x(0) with
the hope that this sequence will converge to a true solution. See Wright and Willams (1984),
Miranda and Helmberger (1988), Marcet (1988) for early applications of …xed-point iteration
to economic problems. Den Haan (1990) proposed a way to implement …xed-point iteration in
models with multiple Euler equations; see also Marcet and Lorenzoni (1999) for related examples. Gaspar and Judd (1997) pointed out that …xed-point iteration is a cheap alternative to
time iteration in high-dimensional applications. Finally, Judd et al. (2010, 2011, 2012) show a
variant of …xed-point iteration, which performs particularly well in the context of the studied
models; we adopt their variant in the present paper. Below, we illustrate the di¤erence between
time-iteration and …xed-point iteration methods using the model (38)–(40) as an example.
6.2.1

Time iteration

Time iteration solves a system of three equilibrium conditions with respect to b
k 0 in each point of
the Smolyak grid. It parameterizes the capital function by Smolyak polynomial b
k 0 = K (k; ; b),
where b is the coe¢ cient vector. It iterates on b by solving for current capital b
k 0 given the
k 0 ; 0 ; b (it mimics time iteration in dynamic proSmolyak interpolant for future capital K b
gramming where we solve for the current value function given the future value function):

The system (41)-(43) must be solved with respect to b
k 0 using a numerical solver. Observe
that Smolyak interpolation K b
k 0 ; 0j ; b must be performed for each subiteration on b
k 0 using
a numerical solver, which is expensive. Time iteration has a high cost even in a simple unidimensional problem.
Time iteration becomes far more expensive in more complex settings. For example, in
the multi-agent version of the model, one needs to solve a system of N Euler equations with
respect to N unknown capital stocks. A high cost of time iteration procedure accounts for a
rapid growth of the cost of the Smolyak method of Malin et al. (2011) with the dimensionality
of the problem.

6.2.2

Fixed-point iteration

We also parameterize the capital function using the Smolyak polynomial b
k 0 = K (k; ; b). Before
performing any computation, we rewrite the Euler equation of the problem (38)–(40) in a way,
which is convenient for implementing a …xed-point iteration
u0 (c0 )
k = E
(1
u0 (c)
0

+ 0 f 0 (k 0 )) k 0 :

(44)

In the true solution, k 0 on both sides of (44) takes the same values and thus, cancels out. In
the …xed-point iterative process, k 0 on the two sides of (44) takes di¤erent values. To proceed,
b ( ; b) in the right side of (44), and we get a di¤erent value in the left side
we substitute k 0 = K
of (44); we perform iterations until the two sides coincide.6
Using parameterization (44), we represent the system of equations (41)-(43) as follows:
k 0 = K (k; ; b) and kj00 = K (k 0 ; 0 ; b) ;
c = (1
) k + f (k) k 0 ;
c0 = (1
) k 0 + 0 f (k 0 ) k 00 ;
u0 (c0 )
b
k0 = E
(1
+ 0 f 0 (k 0 )) k 0 :
u0 (c)

(45)
(46)
(47)
(48)

In each iteration, given b, we compute k 0 ; k 00 ; c; c0 , substitute them into (48), get b
k 0 and continue
iterating until convergence is achieved.
In Appendix D, this approach is extended to a multi-agent version of the model to perform
iterations on N Euler equations. Even in the multidimensional case, our …xed-point iterative
procedure requires only trivial calculations and avoids the need of a numerical solver, unlike
the time-iteration method.
Some theoretical arguments suggest that time iteration may possess better convergence
properties than …xed-point iteration. In particular, for very simple models, it is possible to
show that time iteration has a contraction mapping property locally, which is similar to the
one observed for value function iteration; see Judd (1998, p.553) for details. However, the local
contraction mapping property is not preserved in more complicated models like the multi-agent
model studied later in the paper. It is therefore unknown which iterative scheme has better
convergence properties in general. Our simple …xed-point iteration method was reliable and
stable in all experiments if appropriate damping is used.

Algorithm

Below, we show a Smolyak-based projection algorithm for solving the model (38)–(40).

This kind of parameterization was used by Den Haan (1990) as a technique to implement the parameterized
expectations algorithm in a model with several Euler equations.

Relation to other solution methods in the literature

We now describe the relation between the Smolyak solution method and other numerical methods for solving dynamic economic models in the literature; see Maliar and Maliar (2013) for
a survey of numerical methods for solving large-scale dynamic economic models. First, the
baseline version of the Smolyak method is similar to conventional projection methods in that
it relies on a …xed grid, orthogonal polynomials and deterministic integration methods; see
Judd (1992), Gaspar and Judd (1997), Christiano and Fisher (2000), and Aruoba et al. (2006),
among others. The di¤erence is that conventional projection methods build on tensor-product
rules and their cost grows rapidly with the dimensionality of the problem, whereas the Smolyak
method uses non-product rules and its cost grows far more slowly. Second, the anisotropic
variant of the Smolyak method is similar to solution methods that use di¤erent number of grid
points for di¤erent variables (e.g., few grid points for shocks and many grid points for capital
30

as in Aiyagari (1994), Huggett (1993), Rios-Rull (1997), Krusell and Smith (1998)) and other
numerical methods that rely on discretization of shocks in line with Tauchen and Hussy (1991).
Third, the variant of the Smolyak method with an adaptive domain is related to simulationbased and learning methods; see, e.g., Marcet (1988), Marcet and Sargent (1989), Smith (1991,
1993), Rust (1997), Maliar and Maliar (2005) and Powell (2011). The advantage of simulationbased methods is that they focus on the relevant area of the state space; the shortcoming is
that their accuracy is limited by a low rate of convergence of Monte Carlo integration. The
Smolyak method with an adaptive domain does not rely on Monte Carlo integration: it uses
simulations only for constructing the solution domain, and it uses projection techniques to
accurately solve the model on this domain; in this respect, it is similar to combinations of
projection and simulation methods studied in Judd (2010, 2011, 2012). Fourth, in contrast to
perturbation methods, the Smolyak method is a global solution method whose accuracy does
not decline rapidly away from the steady state and that can be used to accurately solve models
with strong non-linearities. Fifth, in our examples, we focus on equilibrium problems, however,
the techniques described in the paper can be also used in the context of dynamic programming
problems. Winschel and Krätzig (2010) show how to use the conventional Smolyak method in
the context of canonical value function iteration, however, the Smolyak method can be used in
the context of an endogenous grid method of Carroll (2005) and an envelope condition method of
Maliar and Maliar (2013a) both of which can signi…cantly reduce the cost of conventional value
function iteration. Finally, Brumm and Scheidegger (2013) parallelize a sparse grid method
using piecewise local basis functions, and Valero et al. (2013) parallelize a Smolyak method
using a global polynomial function; in particular, the latter article also implements parallel
computation on a Blacklight supercomputer.
Finally, the anisotropic-grid and adaptive-domain constructions, which we propose in the
context of the Smolyak method, will also work for any projection solution method that operates
on a hypercube domain including those based on tensor-product rules, e.g., Judd (1992). Also,
these construction can be e¤ectively used in the context of low-dimensional problems. However,
there are many ways to increase accuracy in problems with low dimensionality, in particular,
one can increase the degree of polynomial approximations. In high-dimensional applications,
increasing the polynomial degree might be too costly. Anisotropic grids or adaptive domain
or their combination may be the only feasible alternative. This is why we advocate these
techniques in the context of the Smolyak method applied to problems with high dimensionality.

6.5

Implementation details

Our algorithm builds on techniques that are used in the related literature. To approximate
expectation functions, we use a 10-node Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule. We could have used
Monte Carlo integration but this would reduce the accuracy dramatically; see Judd et al. (2011)
for a discussion.
We consider two mappings
: X ! [ 1; 1]2 that transform each possible value of state
variables (k; ) 2 X
R2 into a hypercube (which is a square in the two-dimensional case)
2
(x; y) 2 [ 1; 1] . One is a conventional rectangular domain for capital and productivity, and
the other is a rectangular domain constructed on principal components of simulated series. The
31

rectangulars are chosen to enclose the cloud of simulated data as shown in Figure 3. (That
is, we solve the model two times: we …rst compute a solution starting from some initial guess
about the ergodic range, we then simulate time series, and we …nally recompute solutions
more accurately using the rectangular domains that enclose the cloud of simulated data). In
Appendix C, we provide further details on the construction of the two mappings.
We use extrema of Chebyshev polynomials as unidimensional grid points, and we use a
Chebyshev polynomial family as unidimensional basis functions; in this respect, we are similar
to Krueger and Kubler(2004) and Malin et al. (2011). We use the damping parameter = 0:05,
and we use the convergence criterion $ = 10 7 .
Finally, as a measure of accuracy, we report the mean and maximum of unit-free Euler
equation errors on a stochastic simulation of 10,000 observations. Our computer code is written
in MATLAB 2012a, and we use a desktop computer with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU (3.40
GHz) with RAM 12GB. At the initial stage of this project, we bene…ted from consulting with
the Fortran code of Malin et al. (2011).

Results for the representative agent model
1

We parameterize the model (38)–(40) by u (c) = c 1 1 , f (k) = k and ln 0 = ln + ",
where the parameters are …xed at = 0:95, = 0:99 and = 1=3. We set the benchmark
values of = 0:025, = 1 and = 0:01, and we consider variations in , and one-by-one,
holding the remaining parameters at the benchmark values. Speci…cally, we consider
= f0, 0:1, 0:2, 0:3, 0:4, 0:5, 0:6, 0:7, 0:8, 0:9, 1g ;
= f1, 5, 10, 15, 20g ;
= f0:001; 0:005, 0:01, 0:02, 0:03, 0:04, 0:05g :
We use these parameterizations to test the performance of di¤erent versions of the Smolyak
method introduced in the paper.
6.6.1

Conventional isotropic Smolyak grids under di¤erent approximation levels

We …rst solve the model (38)–(40) using a baseline version of the Smolyak method under four
approximation levels = 1, 2, 3, 4. Our baseline version is isotropic, i.e., has the same number
of grid points for capital and productivity, and it operates on a rectangular domain in the
original system of coordinates. The algorithm was able to converge in a wide range of the
parameters and to produce highly accurate solutions.
In Figure 7, we report the (unit-free) maximum residuals in the Euler equation (44) (expressed in log10 units).
The residuals vary from about 1% under = 1 to 10 8 % under = 4. Therefore, the
quality of approximation consistently increases with .
6.6.2

Anisotropic Smolyak grids

We next consider anisotropic variants of the Smolyak method that use di¤erent numbers of grid
points for di¤erent variables. We consider two possibilities ( 1 ; 2 ) = (3; 1) and ( 1 ; 2 ) = (1; 3).
32

Figure 7: Accuracy of the Smolyak method under di¤erent approximation levels.

With these constructions, we have 9 elements in the …rst dimension and 3 elements in the second
dimension, which results in 19 elements in total (i.e., 19 grid points and 19 basis functions);
these are the elements distinguished in Section 4.2.2.
Figure 8: Accuracy of the Smolyak method with anisotropic grid

In Figure 8, we compare the maximum residuals in the Euler equation with anisotropic grids
and isotropic grids. The medium line (the one with triangles) is our benchmark isotropic case
= 2 that contains 13 polynomial terms.
We observe that if we use more grid points in dimension of capital than in dimension
of productivity, the anisotropic Smolyak method produces more accurate solutions than the
benchmark isotropic Smolyak method, but if we have more grid points in productivity than
in capital, the opposite is true. The di¤erence in accuracy between two anisotropic solutions
can be as large as two orders of magnitude. These results illustrate the potential usefulness of
anisotropic grids in economic applications.
6.6.3

Adaptive domain

We next assess how the performance of the Smolyak method depends on the choice of the
solution domain. We compare the accuracy of solutions of the Smolyak method that operates
on the conventional hypercube with that of Smolyak technique that operates on the adaptive

33

Figure 9: Accuracy of the Smolyak method with adaptive domain

rectangular domain. We compare the maximum residuals in the Euler equation under the
conventional and adaptive domains in Figure 9.
The maximum residuals in the Euler equation are about a half order of magnitude (i.e.,
about 5 times) lower under the adaptive Smolyak domain than under the conventional Smolyak
domain for the range of values for , and considered.

6.7

Results for the multicountry model

We now explore the performance of the Smolyak-based projection method in the context of
problems with high dimensionality. To this purpose, we extend the one-agent model (38)–(40)
to include multiple agents. This is a simple way to expand the size of the problem and to have
a control over its dimensionality.
There are N agents, interpreted as countries, that di¤er in initial capital endowment and
productivity level. The countries’productivity levels are a¤ected by both country-speci…c and
worldwide shocks. We study the social planner’s problem. If agents are identical in preferences,
the planner will allocate identical consumption to all agents. However, we do not make use
of the symmetric structure of the economy, and we approximate the planner’s solution in the
form of N capital policy functions, each of which depends on 2N state variables (N capital
stocks and N productivity levels). We solve for N policy functions (k 0 )h = B h bh , where B h is a
matrix of Smolyak basis functions evaluated in the Smolyak grid points and bh is a vector of the
polynomial coe¢ cients for the countries h = 1; :::N . For each country, we use essentially the
same computational procedure as the one used for the representative-agent model. The GaussHermite quadrature method builds on product rules and is not tractable in problems with high
dimensionality. We replace it with monomial rules combined with Cholesky decomposition;
see Judd et al. (2011) for a detailed description of these techniques. For a description of the
multicountry model and details of the computational procedure, see Appendix F.
In Figure 10, we compare four di¤erent solutions to the multicountry model, namely, the
conventional solutions with = 2 and = 3, the anisotropic solution with h1 = 3 for the
capital stocks and h2 = 2 for the productivity levels of all countries, h = 1; :::N (in the …gure,

N
we denote this case as ( 1 ; 2 ) = (3; 2) which means 11 ; :::; N
= (3; :::; 3; 2; :::; 2)).
1 ; 2 ; :::; 2
Finally, we report the solution with = 2 for the Smolyak method with an adaptive domain.
34

Figure 10: Accuracy and running time for the multicountry model

We observe the following results from the …gure. First, the di¤erence between the isotropic
solution with = 3 and that with = 2 is about two orders of magnitude. Second, by using
an anisotropic grid, we can make half of the way between = 2 and = 3 in terms of the
average residuals, and we obtain essentially identical maximum residuals. Third, the e¤ect of
an adaptive domain is also quite sizable, namely, we can reduce the residuals up to one order
of magnitude. Finally, we should draw attention to the computational expense of our solution
method. We observe a clearly concave pattern for the running time in the logarithmic scale.
This means that the expense grows slower than an exponential function, i.e., our implementation
does not appear to be subject to the curse of dimensionality in the sense of Bellman (1961).
Malin et al. (2011) also solve models with up to 10 countries (20 state variables); in
particular, a symmetric speci…cation of Model I in their analysis is similar to the model studied
in the present paper. For this model, their cost in seconds is 1, 59, 916, 7313, 38150 when the
number of countries is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, which grows faster than the exponential function. They
use an approximation level = 2, and their program is written in Fortran. We di¤er in two
respects: …rst, we implement the Smolyak method for interpolation by avoiding the repetitions,
and second, we use a much cheaper version of …xed-point iteration than time iteration used in
Malin et al. (2011). We solve a similar model with 10 countries in about 45 minutes using
MATLAB. However, the third-level Smolyak approximation is expensive even for our e¢ cient
implementation: we need almost 45 hours to solve a model with 10 countries, which increases
accuracy by two orders of magnitude.
Thus, the adaptive domain allows us to make about 1/3 way in terms of accuracy between
= 2 and = 3 without a visible increase in cost. The anisotropic grid with ( 1 ; 2 ) = (3; 2)
gives us essentially the same accuracy as = 3 but uses a considerably smaller number of grid
points and basis function. However, our current implementation of the anisotropic Smolyak
method does not allow us to translate a reduction in the number of Smolyak elements in a
sizable cost reduction in this particular example.

Conclusion

The Smolyak method is designed to deal with high-dimensional applications. However, the
cost of the Smolyak method still grows rapidly with dimensionality of the problem. In this
paper, we propose a more e¢ cient implementation of the Smolyak method that reduces its
computational expense, and we present extensions of the Smolyak method that allow us to
increase its accuracy level while maintaining a …xed computational cost. The analytical and
numerical techniques developed in the present paper are not limited to economic applications
but can be used in other …elds.
First, we propose a more e¢ cient implementation of the Smolyak method than the conventional one, namely, we avoid unnecessary repeated evaluations of basis functions when forming
the Smolyak interpolant. E¢ cient implementation of interpolation is especially important in
the context of numerical methods for solving dynamic economic models in which decision functions or value function need to be interpolated a very large number of times during the solution
procedure, i.e., in each grid point, integration node or time period.
Second, we propose an anisotropic version of the Smolyak grid which allows us to vary the
number of grid points and basic functions by dimension. In a typical economic application,
we know some properties of decision and value functions, and we may use this knowledge to
represent such functions more e¢ ciently using the proposed anisotropic constructions.
Third, we show an e¤ective transformation of the state space of a given economic model into
a normalized hypercube used by the Smolyak method. We …nd that the best accuracy of approximations is attained when we use a minimum hypercube that encloses the high-probability
set of a given economic model.
The above three improvements are related to interpolation. Our last improvement is concerned with an iterative procedure for solving dynamic economic models. Time iteration used
in the existing Smolyak methods rely on numerical solver while a version of …xed-point iteration used in the present paper involves only straightforward computation. This improvement,
although minor in substance, allows us to achieve substantial economizing on cost, especially,
in high-dimensional applications.

Appendices
This section contains some supplementary results. In Appendix A, we describe how to construct
unidimensional Smolyak grid points and basis functions. In Appendix B, we develop the formula
for the Smolyak interpolant in the two-dimensional example with = 2. In Appendix C, we
show an example of constructing adaptive domain. Finally, in Appendix D, we describe the
multicontry model and the solution algorithm.

Appendix A: Unidimensional Smolyak grid points and basis functions
To construct multidimensional Smolyak grid points and basis functions, we must …rst specify
unidimensional grid points and basis functions. Many choice are possible. For example, we can
consider a family of ordinary polynomials, f1; x; x2 ; :::g and grid points generated by dividing
the interval [ 1; 1] into 2i 1 equal parts, i
2 (for i = 1 we assume a grid point 0). In this
manner, for i = 2, we have grid points f 1; 0; 1g and we have basis functions f1; x; x2 g; for
i = 3, we have grid points
1; 21 ; 0; 12 ; 1 , and we use basis functions f1; x; x2 ; x3 ; x4 g, etc.
Another possibility is to use Chebyshev polynomials as basis functions and extrema of
such polynomials as grid points. Approximations based on Chebyshev polynomials have two
useful properties. First, there always exists a unique set of coe¢ cients such that a Chebyshev
polynomial function matches M given values at M grid points. Second, approximations are
uniformly accurate, and error bounds are established. We stick to this choice in our analysis.
Chebyshev polynomials are de…ned in the interval [ 1; 1] with a recursive relation: T0 (x) =
1, T1 (x) = x, and Tn (x) = 2xTn 1 (x) Tn 2 (x) for n 2.7 Chebyshev polynomial of degree
n 1 has n extrema. Let nj be a jth extremum of Chebyshev polynomial of degree n 1 with
j = 1; :::; n,
(j 1)
n
:
cos
j =
n 1
Table 6 presents Chebyshev polynomials of degree n 1 and their n extrema (for the polynomial
of degree 0, the extremum is assumed to be 0). Note that the sequence of unidimensional

Chebyshev polynomials and their extrema cannot be used in Smolyak formula (5) because such
sequence does not satisfy Conditions 1 and 2 of Section 2.5, namely, the number of extrema
is equal to i, with i = 1, 2, 3; :::, and not to 2i 1 + 1 as required by Condition 1, and the

that was used in the main text and that is used later in Appendix B, we have

consecutive sets are not nested as required by Condition 2. However, there is a subsequence
of this sequence that satis…es both Conditions 1 and 2, and is suitable for the conventional
interpolation formula. Namely, we select a subsequence in which the number of extrema is
m (i) = 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, ::: for i = 1; 2; 3; 4; 5:::, respectively (the …rst three sets of such a sequence
are in-boxed elements in the last column of the table).
Therefore, the unidimensional Smolyak basis functions and grid points are as follows: for
i = 1, a grid point is f0g and a basis function is f1g; for i =n2, grid points
o are f 1; 0; 1g and
basis functions are f1; x; 2x2 1g; for i = 3, grid points are

are f1; x; 2x2

Appendix B: Smolyak interpolant under

We compare two alternative formulas for Smolyak interpolation in the two-dimensional case
under the approximation level = 2. One is the conventional formula with repeated basis
functions and the other is an alternative formula introduced in the present paper.
Conventional Smolyak interpolation formula. We consider the conventional Smolyak
formula for interpolation in the two-dimensional case, d = 2, under the approximation level
= 2. Condition max (d; + 1) jij
+ d in (5) becomes 2 i1 + i2 4. We use (7) to
form pi1 ;i2 . In particular, p1;1 , p1;2 and p2;1 are given by (8)–(10), respectively. For the remaining
polynomials, p2;2 , p3;1 and p1;3 , we have

Again, as expected, our interpolation formula gives the same 13 basis functions as those distinguished in (19) for the conventional Smolyak interpolation formula.

Appendix C: Adaptive domain
We show how to adapt the Smolyak hypercube to the high-probability area of the state space in
the context of the representative agent model (38)–(40). Our objective is to de…ne a mapping
that transforms each possible value of state variables (k; ) into (x; y) 2 [ 1; 1]2 . Below, we
show two ways of constructing the mapping , one uses the original coordinates and the other
uses principal components of the original coordinates.

Let us de…ne k; k and ; as intervals for the state variables that we observe in simulation

Adaptive parallelotope. We now describe how to construct the adaptive (inclined) rectangular in Figure 5. To map the state variables into a unit square, we use a principal component
(PC) transformation of the time series as described in Section 5 and illustrated in Figure 6. We

In our experiments, we typically recompute solutions two times: First, we solve the model
using the standard rectangular domain in the original system of coordinates for some guess
k; k

time series solution fkt ; t gt=1;:::;T either to re…ne the guess on the bounds k, k, and for
constructing the conventional domain or to compute k , , k , , V , z x , z x , z y and z y for
constructing the adaptive domain.

Appendix D: Smolyak-based projection methods for problems with
high dimensionality
We describe the multicountry model studied in Section 6.7 and provide further computational
details about the Smolyak method that was used to produce numerical solutions in that section.
Appendix D1. Multicountry model
We test the performance of the Smolyak-based projection method in the context of the multiagent model studied in Judd (2010, 2011, 2012). This allows us to compare the performance of
the Smolyak method with other approaches tractable in high-dimensional applications.

2 ( 1; 1) is the autocorrelation coe¢ cient. The utility and
production functions, uh and f h , respectively, are strictly increasing, continuously di¤erentiable
and concave. We assume that all countries have identical preferences and technology, i.e. uh = u
and f h = f for all h. Under these assumptions, the planner assigns equal weights, h = 1, and
therefore, equal consumption to all countries, cht = ct for all h = 1; ::; N .

for a description of these techniques. We set the damping parameter in (57) at = 0:05, and
we set the tolerance parameter in convergence criterion (58) at # = 7.
