Uncertainty and Economic Activity: Evidence from Business Survey Data

NBER Working Paper No. 16143
June 2010
JEL No. E30,E32,E37
ABSTRACT
What is the impact of time-varying business uncertainty on economic activity? Using partly confidential
business survey data from the U.S. and Germany in structural VARs, we find that positive innovations
to business uncertainty lead to prolonged declines in economic activity. In contrast, their high-frequency
impact is small. We find no evidence of the "wait-and-see"-effect – large declines of economic activity
on impact and subsequent fast rebounds – that the recent literature associates with positive uncertainty
shocks. Rather, positive innovations to business uncertainty have effects similar to negative business
confidence innovations. Once we control for their low-frequency effect, we find little statistically or
economically significant impact of uncertainty innovations on activity. We argue that high uncertainty
events are a mere epiphenomenon of bad economic times: recessions breed uncertainty.

1 Introduction
What is the impact of time-varying business uncertainty on economic activity? Real options
theory associates innovations to uncertainty with a “wait-and-see”effect: if firms suddenly find
themselves in a more uncertain environment they stop investing and hiring and the economy
slips into a recession. This “wait-and-see”-effect has recently attracted attention in the literature: Bloom (2009) and Bloom et al. (2009) use a quantitative RBC model with various adjustment frictions to capital and labor to argue that positive innovations to uncertainty lead to
short-run fluctuations, starting with a rapid decline in aggregate activity, then a rebound phase
and a prolonged overshoot after approximately six months.1 Prima facie, uncertainty shocks
have appealing properties, chiefly among them that no technological regress is required to generate recessions. All that is needed are autonomous increases in business uncertainty.
Bachmann and Bayer (2009), exploring data from a detailed German firm-level panel, argue
that the effects in Bloom (2009) and Bloom et al. (2009) are quantitatively small and do not substantially alter unconditional business cycle dynamics. This is confirmed in Chugh (2009), who
explains the dynamics of leverage with innovations to micro-level uncertainty, but also finds
a small business cycle impact of uncertainty shocks. Using a model with financial frictions,
Gilchrist, Sim and Zakrajsek (2009) argue that increases in uncertainty lead to an increase in the
cost of capital through an increase in bond premia which is followed by a decline in investment
activity. In a similar framework Arellano et al. (2010) show that increases in uncertainty lead to
downsizing of investment projects to avoid default.2 These papers employ mostly quantitative
models and calibration exercises to study the impact of time-varying uncertainty on economic
activity. What is missing from the literature are more agnostic studies of the economic effects
of innovations in uncertainty.3
In this paper we use partly confidential monthly data from business surveys to investigate
the relationship between uncertainty and economic activity within a structural vector autoregressions (SVAR) approach. We confirm the sceptical results in Bachmann and Bayer (2009)
and Chugh (2009) without relying too strongly on a specific model and calibration. These business surveys contain qualitative information on the current state of, and expectations regard1

Figure 2 in Section 2 provides the impulse response of output to an uncertainty shock from the model in Bloom
(2009). The three phases – activity collapse, rebound and overshoot – can be clearly seen in this graph.
2
In a related, but slightly different context, Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2009) argue that innovations to the
volatility of interest rates depress economic activity in small open Latin American economies.
3
The two exceptions we know of are: Alexopolous and Cohen (2009) who use a narrative approach in a structural VAR framework (the incidence of the words “uncertainty” and “economy” in New York Times articles) and find
high-frequency decline-rebound-overshoot dynamics; and Popescu and Smets (2009) who show, again with structural vector autoregressions and for German data, that it is innovations to risk aversion rather than innovations to
uncertainty per se that explain roughly 10%-15% of output fluctuations.

ing, firms’ business situations. Specifically, we use disagreement in business expectations for
the Third FED District Business Outlook Survey (BOS) to estimate the impact of business uncertainty on economic activity.4 We also take seriously the potential criticisms against using
aggregate disagreement measures as proxies of uncertainty. The German IFO Business Climate
Survey (IFO-BCS) data allow us to do so. In particular, we use the confidential micro data of the
survey to compare the disagreement-based measure of uncertainty with a qualitative index of
the forecast error variance of production expectations. We find that the two uncertainty measures are positively correlated and that their impact on economic activity is qualitatively and
quantitatively similar and statistically often indistinguishable. This justifies our use of survey
disagreement as a proxy for uncertainty when micro data are unavailable.
We argue that these high-frequency business survey data are well suited to measure the
direct impact of uncertainty on economic decision making. As discussed in the next section,
“wait-and-see”-dynamics are rather short-run and rely on adjustment frictions, which render
high-frequency data the best candidate to detect these dynamics. Aggregate business survey
data are also readily available. All this puts qualitative survey data in an advantage over quantitative balance sheet data. Business survey data in particular capture the subjective element of
uncertainty, viz the mind set of actual decision makers, as opposed to outside experts. Also, the
confidential survey micro data allow us to compare expectations and realizations of economic
variables and thus – as is the case with the IFO-BCS data – construct two complementary proxies of true ex ante uncertainty: ex ante disagreement and ex post forecast error variance.
We consistently find that in two-variable SVARs innovations to uncertainty have very protracted negative effects on economic activity. The effect on impact, in contrast, is small. This is
documented in Figure 1, where we show in the lower panel an impulse response from a positive
innovation to a measure of business uncertainty from the BOS on U.S. manufacturing industrial production. For comparison, the upper panel shows the impulse response from a negative
innovation to a business confidence measure on the same activity variable. They look very similar. This is a robust finding across specifications and surveys.
We then impose more structure in the identification and add measures of business uncertainty to a VAR with sectoral economic activity and the aggregate unemployment rate in the
spirit of Blanchard and Quah (1989). Consistent with the implications of “wait-and-see”, we
identify the uncertainty shock as a shock which does not influence economic activity in the long
run but which may influence both activity and unemployment on impact. We thus “shut down”
the long-run impact of uncertainty in the hope of making its short-run influence shine through.
4

Using dispersion indexes of expectations as measures of uncertainty has a long tradition in the literature
(mostly in the context of inflation expectations and inflation uncertainty): see, for instance, Zarnovitz and Lambros (1987), Bomberger (1996), Giordano and Soederlind (2003), Fuss and Vermeulen (2004) for a good literature
overview, Bloom et al. (2009) and Popescu and Smets (2009).

(F r ac t (Increase) − F r ac t (Decrease)) ), where F r ac t (Increase) is the fraction of respondents that say that
general business conditions six months from time t will increase. F r ac t (Decrease) is defined analogously. The
upper panel shows the response of manufacturing production to a negative confidence innovation in a twovariable SVAR with C on f i d ence ordered first. The lower panel shows the response of manufacturing production
to a positive uncertainty innovation in a two-variable SVAR with Uncer t ai nt y ordered first. Manufacturing
production is the natural logarithm of the (seasonally adjusted) monthly manufacturing production index
from the OECD main economic indicators. All VARs are run with 12 lags, the confidence bands are at the 95%
significance level using Kilian’s (1998) bias-corrected bootstrap.

We find that there is little statistically or economically significant impact of uncertainty shocks
on economic activity left. Rather, we provide some evidence that negative long-run shocks give
rise to higher uncertainty, which leads us to interpret high uncertainty events as a mere epiphenomenon of bad economic times. We interpret this in light of the view of recessions as times of
destroyed relationships and practices, the reestablishment of which generates uncertainty for
businesses.
The next section discusses the wait-and-see mechanism and delivers a benchmark against
which we compare our empirical results. The third section describes the business survey data
we use. The fourth section presents the main results and interprets them. Details and additional
results are relegated to various appendices.

2 Uncertainty and Activity: “Wait-and-See”
In this section we give a brief overview of the “wait-and-see”mechanism that might give rise
to uncertainty-driven fluctuations.5 In addition to providing a benchmark against which we
can compare our empirical results, this exercise will also serve to motivate the use of highfrequency, sectoral data in examining the impact of uncertainty on economic activity.

Notes: this graph is a replication of the simulated model IRF of out to an uncertainty shock, see Figure 12 in Bloom
(2009). The overshoot reaches its peak after roughly one year, and, as Figure 9 in Bloom (2009) shows, needs two
more years to settle down.

Time-varying uncertainty at the firm level may have economic consequences when there is
a degree of irreversibility to firm actions. For a concrete example, suppose that a firm faces fixed
costs to adjusting the size of its labor force and/or physical capital stock. Suppose further that
there is a mean-preserving spread on the distribution of future demand for the firm’s product.
With fixed adjustments costs, higher uncertainty over future demand makes new hiring and
investment less attractive. The reason for this is intuitive – if a large fixed cost must be paid
5

The literature has highlighted other mechanisms, such as countercyclical default risk in the presence of financial frictions, for instance Arellano et al. (2010), Gilchrist, Sim and Zakrajsek (2009) and Gilchrist, Yankov and
Zakrajsek (2009). While default risk is related to firm-level uncertainty, the two concepts of uncertainty are different.

5

to adjust the firm’s labor or capital, then there is reason to minimize the number of times this
cost must be paid. If the future is very uncertain (in the sense that demand could be either
very high or very low relative to the present), then it makes sense to wait until the uncertainty is
resolved to undertake new hiring and investment. Why pay a large fixed cost now when a highly
uncertain future means that one will likely have to pay the fixed cost again?6
An increase in uncertainty thus makes inaction relatively more attractive. Given a reduction
in hiring, employment, and hence output, will fall through exogenous separations. As the future
begins to unfold, demand or productivity conditions are, in expectation, unchanged. There will
be pent up demand for labor and capital. Inaction today moves firms closer to their adjustment triggers in subsequent periods, leading to expected increases in hiring, investment and a
general rebound and even overshoot in economic activity, followed by a return to steady state.
Figure 2 provides an example of an impulse response of output to an increase in uncertainty,
replicated from the model in Bloom (2009).
This theoretical impulse response highlights an important aspect as pertains to our empirical work. The economic implications of uncertainty shocks in a model with “wait-and-see”effects are decidedly high-frequency in nature. The entire bust-boom cycle in response to increased uncertainty only takes about one year to play out with roughly two more years to revert back to steady state (see for the full impulse response Figure 9 in Bloom, 2009). Thus, an
empirical study of uncertainty that wants to detect “wait-and-see”effects should make use of
high-frequency data, which is one of the reasons why we use monthly surveys in this paper.
An additional advantage of our survey data from specific segments of the economy – specific
sectors and/or regions – is that general equilibrium effects are likely to be mitigated. “Wait-andsee”is clearly a partial equilibrium mechanism, which might be dampened by general equilibrium price adjustments.7 For instance, if in response to an increase in uncertainty, all firms
simultaneously want to shut down hiring, wages are likely to adjust in equilibrium so that at
least some firms do continue hiring. Our focus on sector level data thus gives the “wait-andsee”mechanism a better chance of shining through.

3 Measuring Business Uncertainty
We construct uncertainty measures from the Third FED District Business Outlook Survey (BOS)
and the German IFO Business Climate Survey (IFO-BCS).8 In the next subsection we briefly de6

The argument is equally valid with partial irreversibilities instead of fixed costs.
Note that Bloom (2009) is a partial equilibrium analysis.

Survey (SBETS).

scribe the characteristics of each and list the main survey questions we use to measure business
uncertainty. We then define the variables used in the empirical analysis, followed by a subsection on the the cyclical properties of our main variables.

3.1 Data Description
3.1.1 BOS
The Business Outlook Survey is a monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia since 1968. The survey design has essentially been unaltered since its inception.
It is sent to large manufacturing firms in the Third FED District.9 The survey questionnaire is of
the “box check” variety. It asks about firms’ general business expectations as well as their expectations and actual realizations for various firm-specific variables such as shipments, workforce
and work hours. Respondents indicate whether the value of each economic indicator has increased, decreased, or stayed the same over the past month. They are also asked about their
expectations for each indicator over the next six months. Whenever possible, the survey is sent
to the same individual each month, typically the chief executive, a financial officer or other person “in the know”. Participation is voluntary. The group of participating firms is periodically
replenished as firms drop out or a need arises to make the panel more representative of the
industrial mix of the region. Each month 100-125 firms respond. As noted by Trebin (1998),
occasional telephone interviews are used to verify the accuracy of the survey responses.
The advantages of the BOS are its long time horizon, its focus on one consistent, economically relatively homogenous class of entities – large manufacturing firms10 –, an unparalleled
number of questions that are useful for our research question and the fact that for each question there is a "current change" and an "expectation" version. Its main drawback is the relatively small number of respondents.11 Nevertheless, given its advantages, we use the BOS for
our baseline results. We focus on the following two questions:12
Q 1 “General Business Conditions: What is your evaluation of the level of general business activity six months from now vs. [CURRENT MONTH]: decrease, no change, increase?”
9

The Third Federal Reserve District comprises the state of Delaware, the southern half of New Jersey, and the
eastern two thirds of Pennsylvania.
10
There is a concern that if adjustment costs grow less than proportionally with firm size the firms in the BOS
may be sufficiently large that adjustment costs do not matter for them, and therefore “wait-and-see”cannot be
detected in the BOS. To address this issue, we complement the BOS analysis with the SBETS (see Appendix D) and
find essentially the same results.
11
This problem is alleviated in the SBETS.
12
The other questions we use from the BOS are documented in Appendix B.1.

7

Q 2 “General Business Conditions: What is your evaluation of the level of general business activity [LAST MONTH] vs. [CURRENT MONTH]: decrease, no change, increase?”
Both questions are phrased as if they were about general business conditions. Trebin (1998)
notes, however, that answers to these questions are highly correlated with responses to the shipments question, which is phrased as explicitly company specific. As such, he concludes that
both series are essentially indicators of firm-specific business conditions.
In addition, in order to construct an employment turnover indicator, we use the following
question:
Q 3 “Company

Business

Indicators:

Number

of

Employees

[LAST

MONTH]

vs.

[CURRENT MONTH]: decrease, no change, increase?”

3.1.2 IFO-BCS
The German IFO Business Climate Survey is one of the oldest and broadest monthly business
confidence surveys available (see Becker and Wohlrabe (2008) for more detailed information).
However, due to longitudinal consistency problems and availability of micro data in a processable form only since 1980, we limit our analysis to the manufacturing sector from 1980 until the
present. From 1991 on, the sample includes East-German firms as well.
One of the IFO-BCS’s main advantages is the high number of survey participants. The average number of respondents at the beginning of our sample is approximately 5,000; towards the
end the number is about half that at 2,500.13 Participation in the survey is voluntary and there
is some fraction of firms that are only one-time participants. However, conditional on staying
two months in the survey, many firms continue on and this allows us to construct a measure
of ex post forecast error uncertainty. Our final sample of continuing firms comprises roughly
4,000 respondents at the beginning and 2,000 towards the end of the sample. In terms of firm
size, the IFO-BCS contains all categories. In the survey for January 2009, for example, about
12% of respondents had less than 20 employees, roughly 39% had more than 20 but less than
100 employees, 43% of the participants employed between 100 and 1000 people and less than
7% possessed a workforce of more than 1000 people.
The two main questions that allow us to construct a qualitative index of ex-post forecast
errors are:14
Q 4 “Expectations for the next three months. Our domestic production activities with respect
to product XY will (without taking into account differences in the length of months or seasonal
fluctuations): increase, roughly stay the same, decrease.”
13
14

The IFO-BCS is a survey at the product level, so that these numbers do not exactly correspond to firms.
Here we provide a translation, for the German original see Appendix C.1.

8

Q 5 “Trends in the last month. Our domestic production activities with respect to product XY
have (without taking into account differences in the length of months or seasonal fluctuations):
increased, roughly stayed the same, decreased.”

Since this survey is the only one where we have access to the micro data, it provides us with
an opportunity to compare ex ante uncertainty measures that are derived from cross-sectional
disagreement with a qualitative index of ex post forecast error uncertainty. We can compare
firms’ qualitative predictions about expected changes with their qualitative answers about realized changes.

3.2 Variable Definitions
Survey answers fall into three main categories, I ncr ease, Decr ease, and a neutral category. We
use these categories to define two forward-looking indices concerning expectations and two
indices of current activity. We start with the forward-looking indices, constructed for questions
like Q 1 and Q 4:
C on f i d ence t ≡ F r ac t (Increase) − F r ac t (Decrease).
µ
¡
¢2 ´
Uncer t ai nt y t ≡ sqr t F r ac t (Increase)+F r ac t (Decrease)− F r ac t (Increase)−F r ac t (Decrease) .
Notice that Uncer t ai nt y t is the cross-sectional standard deviation of the survey responses,
if the I ncr ease-category is quantified by +1 and the Decr ease-category by −1 and the residual
categories by 0. This is a standard quantification method for qualitative survey data, under
which C on f i d ence t simply becomes the cross-sectional average of the survey responses. Next,
we define a current index of economic activity for questions like Q 2 and Q 5. Summing up
variables that essentially measure changes is intended to capture a qualitative measure of the
level of economic activity:
Ac t i vi t y t ≡

t
X
τ=1

(F r ac τ (Increase) − F r ac τ (Decrease)).

For the question on actual employment changes, Q 3, we also construct a turnover index,
defined as:
Tur nover t ≡ F r ac t (Increase) + F r ac t (Decrease).

3.3 Is Cross-sectional Dispersion a Good Proxy for Uncertainty?
Measuring the subjective uncertainty of decision makers is inherently difficult. Ideally, one
would like to elicit a subjective probability distribution over future events from the managers,
as has been done in Guiso and Parigi (1999) for Italian firms. With this probability distribution it is straightforward to compute a measure of subjective uncertainty for firms’ decision
makers. However, to the best of our knowledge such probability distributions are not available repeatedly and over long time horizons. Therefore, researchers have to rely on proxies.
Using the cross-sectional dispersion of firms’ expectations as a proxy for firms’ uncertainty is
not without potential problems. First, time-varying cross-sectional dispersion in firms’ survey
responses might simply be due to different firms reacting differently to aggregate shocks even
with constant aggregate and idiosyncratic uncertainty. Secondly, time variation in the dispersion of expectations might be the result of time variation in the heterogeneity of said expectations, without these expectations reflecting a higher degree of uncertainty on the part of the
business managers. In this subsection, we briefly address these concerns, summarizing more
detailed results from various appendices.
We address the first concern – different firms having different factor loadings to aggregate
shocks – by a variance decomposition of (Uncer t ai nt y tI F O )2 into the average within-variance
and the between-variance of the 13 manufacturing subsectors contained in the IFO-BCS (see
Appendix C.2 for details). The idea behind this decomposition is that such differences in factor loadings to aggregate shocks might be due to industry-specific production and adjustment
technologies.

Figure 21 in Appendix C.2, however, shows that the time series of

(Uncer t ai nt y tI F O )2 is clearly not explained by the between-variance of the manufacturing subsectors. This means it is not explained by the manufacturing subsectors getting more or less different over the business cycle. While this is an admittedly imperfect test, because it could still
be the case that differences in factor loadings to aggregate shocks are generated by differences
in production and adjustment technologies below the level of disaggregation that we can study
with the IFO survey, these differences would have to emerge equally in all manufacturing subsectors for the between-variance to have such low explanatory power for the overall variance.
We view this as highly unlikely.
To address the second concern – the relationship between (time-varying) dispersion, uncertainty and cross-sectional shock variance – we present in Appendix A a simple and highly
stylized two-period model where firms receive signals about their uncertain future business
situations. We show for this model that if signals are neither perfectly informative nor perfectly uninformative, under Bayesian updating both the dispersion of firms’ expectations and
the average subjective uncertainty in the cross-section increase in response to an increase in
the cross-sectional variance of firms’ future business situations.
10

The micro data in the IFO-BCS allow us to go a step further and specifically address this
concern. We construct a qualitative index of the ex post forecast error standard deviation, which
by construction excludes heterogeneous, but certain, changes in expectations. To fix ideas, we
proceed as if the production expectation question in IFO-BCS, Q 4, was asked only for the next
month instead of the following three months. In that case, when comparing the expectation in
month t with the realization in month t + 1, nine possibilities arise: the company could have
predicted an increase in production and realized one, in which case we would count this as
zero forecast error. It could have realized a no change, in which case, we would quantify the
expectation error as −1 and, finally, it could have realized a decrease, which counts as −2.

Notes: Rows refer to qualitative production expectations in month t . Columns refer to qualitative production
realizations in month t + 1.

Table 1 summarizes the possible expectation errors. Of course, the production expectation
question in IFO-BCS is for three months ahead. Suppose that a firm stated in month t that
its production will increase in the next three months. Suppose that in the next three months
one observes the following sequence of outcomes: production increased in t + 1, remained unchanged in t + 2 and finally decreased in t + 3. Due to the qualitative nature of the IFO-BCS we
have to make some assumptions about the definition of the expectation error at the micro level.
As a baseline we adopt the following steps. First, we define for every month t a firm-specific activity variable over the next three months, t + 3, by the sum of the I ncr ease-instances minus
the sum of the Decr ease-instances over that time period.15 Denote this variable by RE ALI Z t .
It can obviously range from [−3, 3]. Then the expectation errors are computed as:

15

We also experiment with a weighted sum approach: we weight realizations in t +1 one half, realizations in t +2
one third and realizations in t + 3 one sixth. Naturally, when asked in t about the next three months, the firm may
bias its answer towards the immediate future. None of our results depends on the precise weighting scheme.

Notes: Rows refer to the qualitative production expectations in IFO-BCS in month t (Q 4).

Notice that the procedure in Table 2 is analogous to the one month case. Dividing by three
is simply a normalization. E xpec t at i oner r or t +3 ranges from [− 43 , 43 ], where for instance − 34
indicates a strongly negative forecast error: the company expected production to increase over
the next three months, yet every single subsequent month production actually declined.
Computing the cross-sectional standard deviations of the expectation errors at each month,
t , gives us a qualitative series of forecast error standard deviations. Specifically:
fe

Uncer t ai nt y t ≡ ST D(E xpec t at i oner r or t +3 ).
fe

Notice the timing in the definition of Uncer t ai nt y t : the standard deviation of realized expectation errors in t + 3 does not constitute uncertainty in t + 3. It is the knowledge (at time t )
of this standard deviation going up or down that makes decision makers more or less uncertain at time t . It should be emphasized that this timing does not require decision makers to
know anything about the future, other than that it is more or less uncertain.16 The advantage
fe

of Uncer t ai nt y t over Uncer t ai nt y t is that it is based on actual "uncertain-at-time-t" innovations, as opposed to potentially heterogeneous expectations of the future, which could be
fe

certain. However, the raw correlation coefficient between Uncer t ai nt y t and Uncer t ai nt y t
is reasonably high for monthly data, 0.73, and when we aggregate both series up to the quarterly
level the correlation becomes 0.77. The fact that both conceptually different proxies for uncertainty are reasonably close to each other lends some support to the widespread practice of proxfe

ying uncertainty with survey disagreement. Figure 22 in Appendix C.2 depicts Uncer t ai nt y t

and Uncer t ai nt y t , both at the monthly and the quarterly frequency. Most importantly, the
impulse responses on economic activity look qualitatively and quantitatively similar and are
statistically often indistinguishable (see Section 4.3).
16

We follow here Bloom’s (2009) timing convention for stock market volatility.

3.4 Cyclicality of Business Survey Variables
In this subsection, we report basic cyclical properties of the survey-based variables introduced
fe

in Sections 3.2 and 3.3: Uncer t ai nt y t , Uncer t ai nt y t and Ac t i vi t y t . They have been seasonally adjusted with the SAS X12 procedure, an adaptation of the U.S. Bureau of the Census
X-12-ARIMA seasonal adjustment method. Table 3 displays the cyclical properties of the various survey-based uncertainty measures. They are all countercyclical. This confirms previous
findings by Bloom (2009), Bloom et al. (2009), Chugh (2009) and Bachmann and Bayer (2009),
who find, using different data sources, that stock market volatility and balance-sheet-based
cross-sectional measures of uncertainty are all countercyclical.17 The discrepancy between the
first and second columns for the IFO uncertainty measures is partly, just as for the other surveys,
the result of an imperfect representation of the entire population by the survey sample. For Germany, however, we find that the industrial production measure exhibits a lot of high-frequency
noise-like movements, which in part contributes to this low correlation. The correlation becomes more negative when we aggregate up to the quarterly frequency.

4 Results
In this section we present and discuss our main empirical results. We robustly find that innovations to business uncertainty are associated with small and slowly-building reductions in
economic activity. Imposing the restriction that uncertainty innovations have no long-run effects on activity, which is consistent with the “wait-and-see”-hypothesis, renders the responses
of economic activity to uncertainty insignificant and often essentially zero at all horizons. This
finding is difficult to reconcile with the “wait-and-see”channel from uncertainty to aggregate
dynamics.
We begin the analysis with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Third District Business
Outlook Survey and conclude with the German IFO Business Climate Index. In addition to
providing verification of our main qualitative findings from data in another country, the IFO
micro data allows us to compare our SVAR results when using ex ante survey disagreement
versus the ex post forecast error standard deviation as measures of business uncertainty. We
show that they are similar using either measure as a proxy for uncertainty.

4.1 Third FED District Business Outlook Survey
We begin our analysis with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Third District Business
Outlook Survey. Figure 1 in the Introduction shows impulse responses from two-variable SVARs
with U.S. manufacturing industrial production and, respectively, an innovation to business
confidence and business uncertainty. The variables are ordered such that innovations to the
survey measure influence economic activity on impact but not vice versa.18 Both variables enter the system in levels and we include 12 lags. 19
As noted in the Introduction, the impulse response of manufacturing production to an innovation to business uncertainty is slightly negative on impact with effects that build over time.
The peak decline is at about 1 percent, occurring about two years after impact, with no tendency
to revert. As the upper panel of the figure shows, the response of production to uncertainty is
roughly the same as its response to a negative confidence innovation.
Figure 3 provides corroborating evidence with a different measure of sectoral economic activity. In addition to the forward-looking confidence question, the BOS in Q 2 asks about current business conditions relative to the recent past. We estimate bivariate SVARs with General
Conditions-C on f i d ence tBOS and General Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS and an activity index
based on Q 2, again with activity ordered second. The responses are strikingly similar to that
using overall manufacturing production as the activity measure. This is particularly important,
as we do not have monthly industrial production data disaggregated at the regional and sectoral
level that would allow us to construct a quantitative activity measure that corresponds exactly
to the BOS.20 The fact that the results are nearly identical across two related, but different activity measures lends credence to our findings.21
Two additional observations from Figure 1 in the Introduction and Figure 3 here are worth
18

One might be worried that uncertainty should not affect economic activity on impact because of various information or decision lags. For instance, one might assume that companies know uncertainty only through the
published surveys themselves, when they see a lot of disagreement there. It is reasonable to assume that decision
makers at the firms care very much about the survey results and let their decision making be influenced by them,
as there is no direct financial incentive to participate in these surveys. Figure 15 in Appendix B.3 presents the analog to the lower panel of Figure 1 with economic activity ordered first. From this graph it is clear that timing does
not drive our results.
19
Our results are robust to alternative assumptions about how the variables enter the VAR (i.e. levels vs. differences) as well as to alternative assumptions about lag length. For the cases in which we use a long run restriction
to identify the uncertainty shock, the activity variable enters the VAR in first differences and we show cumulated
impulse responses.
20
Such employment data are only available from 1990 on.
21
In Table 9 in Appendix B.2 we compare various BOS activity measures with the monthly Third FED district BLS
manufacturing employment data from 1990 on. We also compare the monthly BOS activity measures with the
monthly coincident index from the Philadelphia FED, which measures overall economic, not merely manufacturing activity for the Third FED district. Using this index as the activity variable in the two-variable SVAR would yield
identical results. Finally, we compare yearly averages of the BOS activity measures with the yearly NIPA manufacturing production index for the Third FED district. The BOS activity measures are positively correlated with all
these other imperfect activity measures from official statistics, which shows that the BOS depicts the dynamics of

Notes: Both IRFs are based on Q 1. The SVARs are estimated with 12 lags and confidence/uncertainty ordered
first. Both responses are those of General Conditions-Ac t i vi t y tBOS (based on Q 2). The upper panel is based on a
two-variable SVAR with General Conditions-C on f i d ence tBOS (negative innovation). The lower panel is based on
a two-variable SVAR with General Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS (positive innovation). All confidence bands are at
the 95% significance level using Kilian’s (1998) bias-corrected bootstrap.

noting. First, the fact that the General Conditions-C on f i d ence tBOS -variable predicts both manufacturing industrial production and the General Conditions-Ac t i vi t y tBOS -variable well at
medium and long horizons shows that the BOS survey answers reflect accurate expectations
of firms about their future.22 This in turn lends credence to our expectation-based uncertainty
measures. Secondly, the prolonged negative response of economic activity to an innovation in
business uncertainty is consistent with the empirical impulse response of economic activity to
a credit shock in Gilchrist, Yankov and Zakrajsek (2009),23 and the theoretical impulse response
of economic activity to a persistent uncertainty shock in a model with financial frictions in Arellano et al. (2010).
real economic activity in the manufacturing sector of the Third FED district reasonably accurately.
22
Barsky and Sims (2009) find a similar result for consumer confidence and aggregate economic activity. Figure 14 in Appendix B.2 shows the dynamic cross-correlations between BOS C on f i d ence t -variables and BOS
Ac t i vi t y t -variables and they indeed peak at medium to long horizons with confidence leading.
23
Figure 26 in Appendix E shows the analog to Figure 1, using readily available corporate bond spread data as
a measure of uncertainty. The impulse response of industrial production to a corporate bond spread innovation
looks very similar to the one when our survey-based business uncertainty measure is used. In contrast, the impulse
response to stock market volatility is rather different.

Notes: see notes to Figure 3. Uncertainty is ordered first. The employment measures are seasonally adjusted and
logged and are taken from the BLS-CES data base.

In Figure 4 we show impulse responses from bivariate SVARs featuring our BOS baseline
uncertainty measure and various manufacturing employment measures. The responses shown
are that of employment to uncertainty, with uncertainty ordered first. Wait-and-see theories of
the transmission from uncertainty shocks to business cycles emphasize hiring and firing frictions. If the “wait-and-see”-channel were important, we would observe a large reduction in
employment followed by a quick recovery in response to an uncertainty shock, similarly to the
output response in Figure 2 in Section 2. However, the response of manufacturing employment
is rather consistent with our other results: it moves little on impact, followed by a period of sustained reductions, with no obvious tendency for reversion, even at very long horizons. There is
no discernible difference for production and non-production workers, who might be subject to
different adjustment costs.24
24

In Appendix B.3 we provide robustness checks to our first result that in two-variable SVARs uncertainty innovations trigger prolonged declines in economic activity. Figures 16 and 17 vary the economic activity variable used
in the baseline SVAR, while keeping General Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS (based on Q 1) as the uncertainty measure: the BOS shipments, employment and work hours based activity indices and labor productivity. Figures 18
to 20, in turn, vary the uncertainty measure: an indicator variable for high uncertainty in the spirit of Bloom (2009),
an uncertainty measure, based on information-theoretic uncertainty (see Rich and Tracy (2006)), and uncertainty
measures derived from other expectation questions in the BOS. We also experimented with the aggregate investment rate as the activity measure, given that “wait-and-see”-theories equally stress capital adjustment frictions.
The impulse response looks essentially the same as with output and employment. However, since we do not have
sectoral investment data at at least a quarterly frequency, we do not want to over-interpret this result.

17

Another direct and related prediction of the “wait-and-see”-theory is that job turnover – defined as the sum of job creation and job destruction – should decline following an increase in
uncertainty: wait and do nothing. Yet again, the survey data are inconsistent with this prediction. Figure 5 shows the response of the extensive margin of job turnover to an innovation
in uncertainty. The point estimate on and near impact is positive and insignificant from zero,
turning more significant at horizons well beyond one year.25

Notes: see notes to Figure 3. The turnover variable is based on Question 3.

There are two main results from our analysis thus far – one negative and one positive. The
negative result is that there is little evidence supporting the “wait-and-see”-mechanism. On
the positive side we have that innovations to uncertainty appear to contain significant predictive information for the future path of sectoral economic activity. To explore these conclusions
further, as well as to give uncertainty a better chance of leading to high-frequency “wait-andsee”-type dynamics, we now attempt to “control” for any information about long-run economic
activity contained in the uncertainty measures. We do so in three exercises. First, we include
business confidence in the SVAR. As noted previously, confidence is informative about eco25

Admittedly, this evidence is somewhat weak, given that the lower confidence band is rather consistent with
“wait-and-see”. Nevertheless, overall we view Figure 5 as unfavorable evidence for this mechanism. Also, the
dynamic unconditional correlations between the BOS job turnover measure and the BOS uncertainty measures
are, albeit mildly, positive for the uncertainty measures leading between zero and twelve months.

18

nomic activity in the long-run. Orthogonalizing uncertainty with respect to confidence should
control for the long-run predictive component of uncertainty, thereby making it more likely for
the high-frequency impacts of time-varying uncertainty to shine through. Second, we adopt
an identification approach in the spirit of Blanchard and Quah (1989): in a two-variable VAR
with an uncertainty and an activity measure, we identify the uncertainty shock as a shock that
does not impact activity in the long-run. Here the long-run impact of uncertainty, guided by
the “wait-and-see”-hypothesis, is shut down by construction. Third, we include the aggregate
unemployment rate in the Blanchard and Quah (1989)-type SVAR in order to be able to identify
a more conventional aggregate demand shock separately from the short-run uncertainty shock,
where we assume that the conventional demand shock does not affect uncertainty on impact.
The result in all three exercises is clear: once the long-run impact of uncertainty is “controlled”
for, there is (almost) no economically or statistically significant impact of uncertainty on activity
left.

Figure 6 depicts impulse responses of two different measures of activity – manufacturing

thogonalized with respect to General Conditions-C on f i d ence tBOS . As expected, orthogonalizing with respect to a confidence series lowers the quantitative magnitude of the responses of
activity to uncertainty – compare the solid lines and the dashed-dotted lines in Figure 6 – and
makes it almost statistically insignificant, but it appears to do little to change the qualitative
nature of the responses. The response of sectoral activity, however measured, to uncertainty
is small and insignificant on impact, followed by further reductions, and then some evidence
of reversion at longer horizons. Nevertheless, orthogonalizing with respect to the confidence
series does not point to an important “wait-and-see”-effect.

Notes: see notes to Figures 1 and 3. We use manufacturing production as the activity measure, and the General
Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS index as the uncertainty measure. The uncertainty innovation is identified as the
shock that does not impact manufacturing production in the long-run.

Figure 7 shows the impulse responses from a two-variable SVAR with manufacturing production as the activity variable (just as in Figure 1) and the General Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS
index. We identify the uncertainty shock as the one with zero long-run impact on economic activity. Notice that the corresponding long-run shock in our case, unlike in Blanchard and Quah
(1989) who used aggregate production, need not literally be a productivity shock, as we are
dealing with sectoral activity variables. Rather, it is any shock that permanently affects sectoral
output. We find that once uncertainty is bereft of its long-run effect, the impact of higher uncertainty on economic activity becomes positive, but economically small. On the other hand,
20

we find a statistically significant positive impact of a negative long-run innovation on the uncertainty measures. This is precisely what our epiphenomenon hypothesis with respect to uncertainty implies.
For a two-variable VAR specification we are concerned that the short-run shock we identify as an uncertainty shock might be confounding true innovations to uncertainty and a more
conventional aggregate demand shock. Like Blanchard and Quah (1989), we therefore include
the aggregate unemployment rate in the two-variable VAR with sectoral uncertainty and business activity measures and identify two short-run shocks using the usual long-run restriction
for each. We then identify the conventional short-run shock by ordering unemployment last.
Consistent with the “wait-and-see”-hypothesis, this means that uncertainty can change the unemployment rate on impact.

Notes: see notes to Figures 1 and 3. We use manufacturing production as activity measure, and the General
Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS index as the uncertainty measure. The unemployment rate is the (seasonally adjusted) monthly civilian unemployment rate from the BLS. The uncertainty innovation and the conventional shortrun shock are identified as shocks that do not impact manufacturing production in the long-run. The conventional
short-run shock is identified as the innovation that does not affect the uncertainty index on impact.

Figure 8 shows the impulse responses in such a three-variable SVAR, and Table 5 the corresponding forecast error variance decomposition for horizons ranging from one month to five
years. Both results from the two-variable specification – no significant impact of uncertainty
21

on economic activity and an increase of uncertainty to negative long-run innovations – “survive”.26 The forecast error variance for activity is mainly driven by the long-run and the conventional short-run shock, while the contribution of the uncertainty shock after three months
drops below 10 percent. The contribution of the uncertainty shock to the fluctuations of the
unemployment rate is even smaller.27 The long-run shock accounts for a significant fraction of
the fluctuations in the uncertainty index in the first six months.

4.2 IFO Business Climate Index
We next present results from the German IFO Business Climate Index. The main advantage here
is that we have access to the micro data, which allows us to compute a measure of uncertainty
f e IFO

based on the ex post forecast error standard deviation – Uncer t ai nt y t
the results with the ex ante disagreement uncertainty measure

– and compare

– Uncer t ai nt y tI F O .

The results

using either uncertainty measure are quite similar to those from the BOS. This provides corroboration of the results from U.S. data. It also serves as support for our use of a disagreement
measure as an uncertainty proxy when micro data are unavailable.
Figure 9 shows the activity responses for the baseline two-variable SVARs to the two types
of uncertainty innovations we are considering. The activity variable is based on Q 5, the IFO
current production question. The SVARs here include a dummy variable from 1991 on to account for structural breaks associated with the German reunification, though our results are
quite insensitive to alternative ways of dealing with that event. There are two important results: First, we see that the responses of activity to the two different measures of uncertainty
26

If we reverse the Choleski order between the uncertainty and the conventional aggregate demand shock, i.e.
we allow the latter to have an immediate impact on the uncertainty index, we often also find uncertainty increasing
to negative aggregate demand innovations, but this effect turns out to be hardly statistically significant. The other
impulse responses are quite robust to changing the Choleski order.
27
It is somewhat larger for the IFO-BCS (Table 6, next section) and the SBETS (Table 11, Appendix D).

22

are quite similar to each other, in fact statistically indistinguishable. Second, the results are also
similar to those from the BOS, with somewhat more evidence of reversion at longer horizons
f e IFO

when Uncer t ai nt y t

is used. The impact effects on activity are small, with the trough of

the negative response occurring roughly two years subsequent to the shock.

Notes: Uncer t ai nt y t is based on Q 4. Uncer t ai nt y t is based on Q 4 and Q 5. The activity variable is based on
Q 5. Uncertainty is ordered first. We include a dummy variable from 1991 to account for the German reunification.
We run the SVARs with 12 lags. All confidence bands are at the 95% significance level using Kilian’s (1998) biascorrected bootstrap.

We conclude by largely confirming the BOS results from the three-variable Blanchard-Quahfe

type SVAR with Production-Ac t i vi t y tI F O , Uncer t ai nt y t and Uncer t ai nt y t , and the unemployment rate in Figure 10 and Table 6. We find that uncertainty measured either way has lower
impact on sectoral economic activity than in the BOS and somewhat more impact on the unemployment rate, especially for the disagreement measure Uncer t ai nt y t . The impulse response
to neither uncertainty measure is similar to “wait-and-see”-dynamics. We again find that a negative long-run shock has a sizeable positive impact on the uncertainty index. The similarity between the BOS and IFO-BCI results suggests that the negative findings in Bachmann and Bayer
(2009) as well as Popescu and Smets (2009) with regards to the role of uncertainty innovations
as a major driving force of short-run fluctuations are not driven by their use of German data.

Notes: see notes to Figure 9. The unemployment rate is the (seasonally adjusted) monthly unemployment rate
from the Bundesanstalt für Arbeit. The uncertainty innovation and the conventional short-run shock are identified
as shocks that do not impact manufacturing production in the long-run. The conventional short-run shock is
identified as the innovation that does not affect the uncertainty index on impact.

4.3 Discussion
In simple two-variable VARs with sectoral business uncertainty and economic activity variables we find protracted negative impulse responses of activity to uncertainty innovations. Job
turnover reacts positively to the same shocks. This is inconsistent with the high-frequency
“wait-and-see”-dynamics recently advocated in the literature. Imposing somewhat more structure on the SVAR identification makes the effects of sectoral business uncertainty on sectoral
economic activity essentially vanish. These results leave open two interpretations for the role
of uncertainty in economic fluctuations. The first interpretation is that uncertainty is an autonomous source of such fluctuations but has mainly long-run effects, similar to productivity
innovations. In this case our SVARs show that structural models using these innovations need
a mechanism that transmits rather transitory uncertainty shocks into very persistent output
declines. Alternatively, uncertainty can be viewed as mainly an epiphenomenon that accompanies bad economic times.

Notes: see notes to Figures 8 and 9. The first and second panel are simply a replication of the ‘Uncertainty to
Long-Run’ impulse responses from these figures. The third panel displays the ‘Uncertainty to Long-Run’ response
of a three-variable Blanchard-Quah-type SVAR with ‘Corporate Bond Spread’ as the uncertainty measure, total
industrial production as the activity measure and the civilian unemployment rate. ‘Corporate Bond Spread’ refers
to the spread of the 30 year Baa corporate bond index over the 30 year treasury bond. Where the 30 year treasury
bond was missing we used the 20 year bond. Data source for the bond data is the Federal Reserve Board.

26

We lean towards the second interpretation. Figure 11 shows the response of the BOS and
IFO uncertainty indices, respectively, to the identified long-run shock. We also run an analogous SVAR with the 30 year corporate bond spread as the uncertainty measure. It is clear that
negative long-run innovations have significant impact on uncertainty. In other words: bad economic times breed uncertainty. Also, the forecast error variance decomposition in Tables 5
and 6 shows that the long-run innovations contribute significantly to fluctuations in the uncertainty index.28
We think of recessions as times of severed business and customer relationships and of failing
business models. Business and customer relationships have to be reestablished and business
models altered when the economy is at trough. This generates uncertainty. In booms, in contrast, businesses have little incentive (or opportunity) to substantially change their operating
practices. Customers stay with their preferred business.
As a highly stylized example, suppose there are three businesses in an economy each producing the same product, with total demand equal 2 units of the product. Suppose initially that
all three businesses have an equal share of two-thirds. In a boom demand becomes 2.5. Since
there are costs to establishing new business relationships, the customers of each business stick
with them and simply demand more. There is no uncertainty. In a recession, in contrast, demand becomes 2x, where x < 1. Assume that one of the businesses goes under and business
relations are severed. The existing customers at the two remaining businesses now demand 23 x
each. What happens to the customers whose preferred business partner vanished? Let us assume there is some uncertainty over where they are going to go, as in a location model where
businesses do not know the spatial distribution of customers. On the one extreme, the allo¤
£
cation might be 43 x, 23 x , i.e. one business gets all the free customers, on the other extreme
¢
¡
it might be an equal split: [x, x]. It is obvious that there exists a range for x, namely 12 , 23 ,
where even in the most equal distribution both businesses are worse off than before, but with
an unequal split one business might even come out better than before in this recession. The
important point is this: there is an intrinsic uncertainty due to recessions, because business
structures and practices have to be re-arranged.29
Table 7 shows that almost all NBER recessions were periods of high uncertainty whether it is
measured as business uncertainty from survey data, the corporate bond spread as in Gilchrist,
Yankov and Zakrajsek (2009), or stock market volatility as in Bloom (2009). We define high uncertainty events as months when either uncertainty measure was one standard deviation above
its time series average. But there is also a considerable fraction of months, close to 10 per28

For the SVAR with the corporate bond spread the contribution of the long-run innovation to the 1M, 3M, 6M,
1Y, 2Y, 5Y-ahead forecast error variance is 51%, 55%, 53%, 54%, 61%, 63%, respectively.

It is beyond the scope of this paper to fully flash out a model of intrinsic uncertainty as a result of bad first
moment shocks, we leave this for future research.

evidence that uncertainty is a concomitant factor of bad economic times rather than a causal
factor for them.

Notes: Uncer t ai nt y BOS refers to the BOS uncertainty measure, based on Q 1. For ‘Corporate Bond Spread’ see
notes to Figure 11. ‘Stock Market Volatility’ refers to the stock market volatility measure used in Bloom (2009),
which until 1986 is realized monthly stock return volatility, and thereafter an implied volatility index. For each
uncertainty proxy we construct a high uncertainty dummy, setting it unity, when the value exceeds the time series
average by one standard deviation (this is similar to Bloom’s (2009) uncertainty index construction). In the first
column we report how many post 1960 recessions coincide with high uncertainty events. We do not have BOS or
stock market volatility data available for the 1961 recession. There are no high corporate bond spread-uncertainty
events during the 1961 and the 1991 recessions. In the second column we report the fraction of months where high
uncertainty events occur outside of NBER recessions.

5 Final Remarks
Using two different measures of business uncertainty from high-frequency, sectoral business
surveys in an agnostic structural vector autoregressions framework we find that positive innovations to sectoral business uncertainty have protracted negative implications for sectoral
economic activity much in the same way as negative sectoral business confidence shocks have.
Shutting down these long-run implications leaves little significant impact on economic activity. We argue that these results are inconsistent with the “wait-and-see”-channel recently advocated in the literature. Rather, we find that negative long-run shocks lead to high uncertainty
events. While we leave open the possibility that uncertainty fluctuations are important autonomous economic shocks with long-run implications, we interpret our findings as reflecting
the fact that uncertainty is a concomitant phenomenon of negative first moments events in the
economy. Bad times breed uncertainty.

A Appendix - A Simple Model
To illustrate the relationship between such concepts as disagreement, uncertainty and crosssectional variance, we use the following simple two-period model: tomorrow’s business situation of firms is unknown today, it can move into three directions. Business situations can
improve (+1), stay the same (0) or deteriorate (−1). For each firm, nature draws the change
in business situation from the following probability distribution: [0.5 ∗ (1 − p), p, 0.5 ∗ (1 − p)],
which is assumed to be known to the firms. The cross-sectional variance of the future business
situation is obviously (1 − p), a decreasing function of p. Furthermore, we assume that businesses receive a signal about the change in their business situation, with a structure illustrated
in Table 8. For instance, if tomorrow’s true state is +1, the signal can be +1 (with probability q)
and 0 with probability (1 − q). q thus measures the informativeness of the signal.

Using Bayes’ Law we can compute the probabilities of the true state, conditional on a signal:

q∗0.5∗(1−p)
q∗0.5∗(1−p)+0.5∗(1−q)∗p

(b) P r ob(st at e = 0|si g nal = 1) =

(c) P r ob(st at e = −1|si g nal = 1) = 0

(c) P r ob(st at e = −1|si g nal = 0) = (1−q)∗0.5∗(1−p)+q∗p+(1−q)∗0.5∗(1−p)
3.

(a) P r ob(st at e = 1|si g nal = −1) = 0
(b) P r ob(st at e = 0|si g nal = −1) =

q∗0.5∗(1−p)+0.5∗(1−q)∗p

(c) P r ob(st at e = −1|si g nal = −1) =

q∗0.5∗(1−p)
q∗0.5∗(1−p)+0.5∗(1−q)∗p

From these conditional probabilities, conditional expectations and variances can be computed. And these, in turn, allow us to calculate 1) the variance of the conditional expectations
over the change in business situations, which is a measure of disagreement; and 2) the average
conditional variance over the change in the business situation of a firm, which is a measure of
the average (subjective) uncertainty in the population of firms.
We begin with the case of perfectly informative signals: q = 1. In this case, obviously, survey
disagreement moves one for one with the variance of tomorrow’s state, but firms do not experience any subjective uncertainty about the change in their business situation. With q = 1 and
in a two period set up disagreement and uncertainty do not comove. The fact that we find substantial forecast errors in the IFO-BCS suggests that this extreme case may not be realistic. But
even if we assumed q = 1 and thus certainty for the immediate future, higher disagreement
today indicates a higher cross-sectional variance in business situations tomorrow and thus
higher uncertainty about business situations for periods beyond the immediate future, as long
as the variance of future innovations to the business situation of firms has some persistence beyond the immediate period and signals are not perfectly informative about this farther future.

Next, we look at the cases with imperfectly informative signals, i.e. q < 1. We know from the
conditional variance decomposition formula that if the variance of tomorrow’s state increases
either the variance of the conditional expectations over tomorrow’s state (disagreement) or the
average conditional variance over tomorrow’s state (average subjective uncertainty) has to increase, both may increase. The following Figure 13 shows for various levels of the signal precision, q, that the latter is indeed the case in this model. The actual cross-sectional variance
of tomorrow’s state is given by the black solid line, the variance of the conditional expectations
over tomorrow’s state (disagreement) by the blue dashed line and the average conditional variance over tomorrow’s state (subjective uncertainty) by the red dotted line.

Finally, in order to translate the continuous disagreement measure – the variance of the
conditional expectations over the change in business situations – into discrete disagreement
in survey answers, where only [−1, 0, 1] as an answer are possible, we assume that if the firm
receives zero as a signal, it will answer zero, simply because the conditional expectation is zero
in this case (by the symmetry of the model). Furthermore, if it receives a signal equal to 1, the
probability of answering 1 in the survey equals the conditional expectation, which ranges from
1 (if p = 0) to 0 (if p = 1). This means, the closer the conditional expectation is to unity, the more
likely firms are going to respond with 1 in the survey. Symmetrically for the case of receiving a
signal that equals −1. With these assumptions, the variance of the survey answers is given by:
33

V AR[answer ] =

(1 − E [answer ])2 E [st at e|si g nal = 1] ∗ P r ob(si g nal = 1) +
(0 − E [answer ])2 (1 − E [st at e|si g nal = 1]) ∗ P r ob(si g nal = 1) +
(0 − E [answer ])2 P r ob(si g nal = 0) +
(0 − E [answer ])2 (1 − E [st at e|si g nal = −1]) ∗ P r ob(si g nal = −1) +
(−1 − E [answer ])2 (E [st at e|si g nal = −1]) ∗ P r ob(si g nal = −1)

This discretized version of disagreement is also shown in Figure 13, by the green dasheddotted line. It follows closely the continuous disagreement measure. Notice that for intermediate signal qualities, both disagreement and uncertainty move in the same direction as the
variance of the state tomorrow. In particular for high values of p subjective uncertainty varies a
lot with the cross-sectional variance of the change in business situations. If the signal was such
that it left everybody with the same conditional expectation (q = 0), then of course disagreement would always be zero. Only the subjective uncertainty would then be affected.

B.3 Additional BOS Results
This appendix provides various robustness checks to the results in Section 4.1. Figure 15 shows
that the ordering between uncertainty and activity variables is irrelevant for the result that uncertainty innovations in two-variable SVARs trigger prolonged declines in sectoral economic
activity. Figures 16 and 17 vary the economic activity variable used in our baseline two-variable
SVAR, while keeping General Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS (based on Q 1) as the uncertainty
measure: the BOS shipments, employment and workhours based activity indices, and labor
productivity. Figures 18 to 20, in turn, vary the uncertainty measure used: an indicator variable
for high uncertainty, an entropy-based uncertainty measure and uncertainty measures derived
from other expectation questions in the BOS.

Notes: see notes to Figure 15. The uncertainty variable here is an indicator variable that takes on a value of one, if
General Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS , the measure of uncertainty which is based on Q 1, is one standard deviation
above its mean, and zero otherwise. There are 60 high-uncertainty observations, or about 12% of the sample.
Models with non-convexities typically predict that it is large increases in uncertainty that matter, not the frequent
increases and decreases observed in most months. That is why we follow Bloom (2009) and construct such an
uncertainty indicator. Using indicator variables in a VAR analysis is similar to the “event study” identifications, for
example, in Ramey and Shapiro (1998).

industry analogs of (Uncer t ai nt y tI F O )2 for the following 13 manufacturing industries: transportation equipment (Fahrzeugbau), machinery and equipment (Maschinenbau), metal products (Metallerzeugung), other nonmetallic mineral products (Glas, Keramik, Verarbeitung von Steinen und Erden), rubber and plastic products
(Gummi und Kunststoff ), chemical products (Chemische Industrie), electrical and optical equipment (Elektrotechnik, Feinmechanik und Optik), pulp, paper, publishing and printing (Papier, Verlage, Druck), furniture and jewelery
(Möbel und Schmuck), cork and wood products except furniture (Holz ohne Möbel), leather (Leder), textiles and
textile products (Textil und Bekleidung), food, beverages and tobacco (Ernährung und Tabak). We leave out the
oil industry, because it has only very few observations. ‘Between-Variance’ refers to the cross-sectional variance of
the industry analogs of (C on f i d ence tI F O ).

D Appendix - Small Business Economics Trends Survey (SBETS)
The Small Business Economic Trends Survey (SBETS) is a monthly survey conducted by the National Foundation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) which focuses on small companies across
the U.S. and across all sectors. Thus the SBETS is a good complement to the BOS which focuses
on larger manufacturing firms in the Third FED District. To the extent that the SVAR results are
similar this appendix lends additional support to our findings. The SBETS’s monthly part starts
in 1986. The survey on a quarterly basis is available since the mid 1970s. We prefer the highest
possible frequency to give the “wait-and-see”-dynamics the best possible chance to appear in
the data. None of our results depend on that choice of frequency. In terms of participation, the
October 2009 issue of the SBETS (see Dunkelberg and Wade, 2009) reports that from January
2004 to December 2006 roughly 500 business owners responded, and that the number has subsequently increased to approximately 750.30 Almost 25% of respondents are in the retail sector,
20% in construction and 15% in manufacturing, followed by services, which ranges well above
10%. All other one-digit sectors have a single digit representation fraction. In terms of firm size,
the sample contains much smaller enterprises than the BOS: the modal bin for the number of
employees31 is "three to five", to which over 25% of respondents belong, followed by the "six to
nine"-category with roughly 20%. The highest category is "forty or more", which contains just
under 10% of firms.32
We use three questions from the SBETS. The confidence and uncertainty indices are based
on a question about general business conditions just like in the BOS:33
Q 13 “About the economy in general, do you think that six months from now general business
conditions will be better than they are now, about the same, or worse?: 1 Much better, 2 Somewhat better, 3 About the same, 4 Somewhat worse, 5 Much worse, 6 Don’t know. ”

One advantage of this question over its BOS version is that it is slightly more nuanced in that
it allows for two "increase"- and two "decrease"-categories. We quantify the extreme categories
with −2 and 2, respectively. To measure activity in the SBETS we use:
Q 14 “During the last calendar quarter, was your dollar sales volume higher, lower, or about the
same as it was for the quarter before? 1 Much higher 2 Higher 3 About the same, 4 Lower 5
Much lower. ”
30

The participation in the quarterly survey is higher, 1200 on average before January 2007 and 1750 thereafter.
This includes full- and part-time employees.
32
For this and more details, see Dunkelberg and Wade (2009).
33
The box and the bold font are also used in the original.
31

44

And as with the BOS we construct a turnover index for employment from an actual employment change question:
Q 15 “During the last three months, did the total number of employees in your firm increase,
decrease or stay about the same? 1 Increased 2 Decreased 3 Stayed the same. ”

Figure 23 displays the analog of Figure 3 in Section 4.1. Both negative business confidence
innovations and positive business uncertainty innovations lead to long and protracted negative
reactions of the economic activity of small firms. Similarly to the BOS, there is little or no highfrequency impact followed by a strong rebound of economic activity.

Notes: Confidence and uncertainty are based on Q 13. The activity variable is based on Q 14. The upper panel is
based on a two-variable SVAR with confidence ordered first, then activity. It displays the response of the SBETS
Sales Activity Index to a negative confidence innovation. The lower panel is based on a two-variable SVAR with
uncertainty ordered first, then activity. It displays the response of the SBETS Sales Activity Index to a positive
uncertainty innovation.

Figure 24 is similar to Figure 5 from the BOS. It shows the impulse response of the job
turnover measure to an innovation to uncertainty. As before, to the extent to which job turnover
reacts to business uncertainty at all, it rises (at least the point estimate), which is inconsistent
with “wait-and-see”-theories of uncertainty shocks.

Notes: see notes to Figure 23. The IRF is based on a two-variable SVAR with uncertainty ordered first and then job
turnover. Job turnover is based on Q 15.

Finally, Figure 25 and Table 11 display the analogs of Figure 8 and Table 5 in Section 4.1.
There is little, albeit compared to the BOS somewhat larger impact of uncertainty innovations
to either sectoral economic activity or the economy-wide unemployment rate. There is again
some impact of the long-run innovations on the uncertainty index.

Notes: see notes to Figure 23. The unemployment rate is the (seasonally adjusted) monthly civilian unemployment
rate from the BLS. The uncertainty innovation and the conventional short-run shock are identified as shocks that
do not impact manufacturing production in the long-run. The conventional short-run shock is identified as the
innovation that does not affect the uncertainty index on impact.

Notes: The ‘Stock Market Volatility’ IRF is a replication of Figure 2 in Bloom (2009), with the exception that we
use 95% confidence bands. It shows the response of U.S. industrial production with respect to a stock market
volatility shock. The variables in the estimation order are log(S&P500 stock market index), a stock-market volatility
indicator, Federal Funds Rate, log(average hourly earnings), log(consumer price index), hours, log(employment),
and log(industrial production). All variables are Hodrick-Prescott (HP) detrended (λ = 129,600). The main stockmarket volatility indicator is constructed to take a value 1 for a month with particularly high volatility, see Bloom
(2009) for details. The ‘Corporate Bond Spread’ IRF is the analog of the impulse response in the lower panel of
Figure 1 for an uncertainty measure based on corporate bond spreads as in Gilchrist, Yankov and Zakrajsek (2009).
‘Corporate Bond Spread’ refers to the spread of the 30 year Baa corporate bond index over the 30 year treasury
bond. Where the 30 year treasury bond was missing we used the 20 year bond. Data source for the bond data is
the Federal Reserve Board. The corresponding activity measure is total industrial production. Uncer t ai nt y tBOS
is based on General Conditions-Uncer t ai nt y tBOS , i.e. Q 1. The corresponding activity measure is manufacturing
industrial production.
