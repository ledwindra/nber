ABSTRACT
Using a novel, high frequency dataset on capital control actions in 16 emerging market
economies (EMEs) from 2001 to 2012, we provide new insights into the domestic and
multilateral effects of capital controls. Increases in capital account openness reduce monetary
policy autonomy and increase exchange rate stability, confirming the constraints of the monetary
policy trilemma. Both gross in- and outflows rise, while the effect on net capital flows is
ambiguous. Tighter capital inflow restrictions generated significant spillovers, especially in the
post-2008 environment of abundant global liquidity. We also find evidence of a domestic policy
response to foreign capital control changes in countries that are affected by these spillovers.

1. Introduction
As the size and volatility of international capital flows have increased over the past
decade, the policy debate about how to manage these flows has intensified. A key question being
debated is whether capital controls are useful as tools to manage capital inflow surges.
Proponents argue that capital controls are effective in stemming large and volatile inflows in
recipient countries and can therefore be valid tools of macroeconomic and macro-prudential
management (IMF, 2011a). However, the empirical evidence of effectiveness of capital controls
in meeting domestic policy objectives is mixed. 3
While the evidence on the domestic effects of capital controls may be limited, what
makes capital controls an issue of heated international debate is the concern that these controls
may have multilateral, i.e. spillover effects. They may distort the global allocation of resources
by diverting flows to other economies and can be used as tools in a currency war to gain an
unfair competitive advantage. Just as concerns have been raised about spillovers of nonconventional monetary policies in advanced economies on emerging market economies (EMEs),
so have policy-makers in the latter countries raised concerns about the use of capital controls in
other EMEs.
We provide new evidence on both aspects of this debate: First, we investigate whether
capital controls are effective in influencing gross flows using a model specification based on the
monetary policy trilemma. Second, we examine whether capital control actions have spillover
effects and whether these have become more important in the post-global financial crisis
environment of abundant global liquidity. In order to address these questions, we use a novel
dataset of 782 policy changes or capital control actions (CCAs) in 16 EMEs over the period 1
January 2001-31 December 2012, along with information about their precise implementation
dates.
We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we use a new, high frequency dataset
on capital control actions, which allows us to more precisely capture the policy whose
effectiveness is being assessed. This adds to the literature as most existing cross-country studies
on the effectiveness of capital controls tend to use less precise (and annual) measures of
3

Recent literature overviews suggest that capital flow measures have little effect on overall capital flows, although they may have an impact on
the composition of flows (Magud et al., 2011). Effects of capital flow measures may vary markedly across the types of capital controls, with
those on debt and equity flows being more effective in influencing capital flows than others (Binici et al., 2010). There is also evidence that
controls may increase the maturity of inflows (De Gregorio et al., 2000).

3
existence of capital controls across countries, which do not capture how policy is actually used
for counter-cyclical macroeconomic management. Using data on policy actions also allows us to
conduct the analysis using quarterly data, thus focusing on a horizon that is more relevant for
policy-makers.
Second, we investigate the effectiveness of changes in capital controls in a model based
on the monetary policy trilemma. 4 The literature has identified several potential macroeconomic
targets of using capital controls policy: the level or composition of capital flows, the level or
volatility of exchange rate, and the level of monetary policy autonomy. These variables are
related via the monetary policy trilemma. This trilemma, or the impossible trinity, states that it is
impossible to simultaneously have a fixed exchange rate, an independent monetary policy and an
open capital account. The trilemma assumes that a change in de-jure openness leads to an
equivalent change in de-facto openness, and equates the two. This is where the scope for testing
capital control effectiveness through the lens of the trilemma arises. In a panel VAR framework,
we ask whether de-jure changes in a country’s openness lead to changes in de-facto openness
and therefore in the level of monetary policy autonomy and the volatility of the exchange rate.
This approach also takes into account the endogeneity of capital controls, highlighted by the
recent literature. 5 Aizenman and Pasricha (2013), for example, find that countries actively
modify capital controls to manage pressure of inflows, and Pasricha (2017) that capital controls
policy systematically responds to both mercantilist and macroprudential concerns. While VARs
have been commonly used in country-specific studies examining the impact of capital controls,
we are among the first to use structural VARs in a panel setting, and, to our knowledge, the first
to do this for spillover effects of capital controls. 6
Third, we provide a comprehensive assessment of cross-country spillover effects of
capital controls for both the pre- and the post-global financial crisis period, a topic on which
there is currently little empirical evidence. The available evidence either pertains to post-crisis
4
The empirical evidence on the effects of capital controls on the variables of the monetary policy trilemma is mixed. For instance, Klein and
Shambaugh (2015) find that with pegged exchange rates, capital controls provide greater monetary autonomy only when they are long standing
and extensive. Miniane and Rogers (2007) show that countries with more stringent capital controls were not more insulated from foreign
monetary policy shocks. Hutchison, Pasricha and Singh (2013) find that even in a country with extensive capital controls, these controls were
able to sustain a covered interest rate differential between onshore and offshore markets only in periods in which these controls were actively
tightened. Further capital controls do not seem to have a clear effect on currency appreciation in most cases (Pandey et al., 2015; Jinjarak et al.,
2013), with the exception of Chile in the 1990s (Edwards and Rigobon, 2009).
5
Existing tests of the trilemma are based on testing whether the indices of (levels) of capital controls, monetary policy autonomy and exchange
rate stability add to a constant (Aizenman, Chinn and Ito, 2010) or whether nominal interest rates in a country respond more to foreign interest
rates in countries with more open capital accounts and less flexible exchange rates (Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor, 2005) or testing comovements of asset prices with the global financial cycle (Rey, 2015).
6
Saborowski et al. (2014) use panel VARs to assess the effectiveness of capital outflow restrictions in EMEs. Studies using country-specific
VARs include Cardoso and Goldfajn (1998), De Gregorio et al. (2000) and Baba and Kokenyne (2011).

years and the impact of one country’s capital controls (Forbes et al., 2016; Lambert et al., 2011),
one region (Chantapacdepong and Shim, 2015) or uses less precise measures of capital controls
(Beirne and Friedrich, 2014; Giordani et al., 2017). We provide evidence that spillovers for the
largest EMEs transcended regions and became stronger in the post-crisis environment of
abundant global liquidity. We are among the first to provide evidence of policy spillovers,
whereby countries respond to capital controls in the BRICS by changing their own capital
controls.
On domestic effects, our main conclusion is that policy choices in EMEs during the
2000s were constrained by the monetary policy trilemma. Steps to dismantle capital account
restrictions had a positive, though short-lived, impact on gross capital flows. As policy-makers
gave priority to exchange rate stability, along with easing restrictions, there was a weakening of
monetary policy autonomy. As both gross in- and outflows increased in response to easing of dejure capital account restrictions, there was no impact on net capital inflows. These findings are
consistent with evidence in the literature that, in the past decade, EMEs have become more
important as a source of capital in addition to being a recipient of capital, implying that the
behavior of net capital flows depends more than in the past on resident flows. Our results thus
suggest that resident flows warrant attention when analyzing the impact of capital controls.
As regards spillovers, our main finding is that the cross-border effects of capital flow
policies are more important than generally thought. We find clear evidence that during the 2000s
and early 2010s net inflow tightening measures in large countries had implications for other
countries.
Our paper is structured as follows. After explaining our dataset on capital controls in
Section 2, we discuss policy trends in capital control actions in Section 3. Section 4 discusses our
empirical methodology. Our results for domestic and multilateral effects of capital controls are
presented in Sections 5 and 6, respectively, and Section 7 concludes.

2. Measuring capital controls 7
A cross-country empirical study of the effects of a certain policy hinges on the quality of
the measurement of that policy. Measuring capital controls is a challenging task. The pre-global
7

5
financial crisis literature used annual indices of the level of capital controls. 8 These indices are
better at capturing the extensive margin of controls (how many types of transactions are
regulated) than the intensive margin (how the restrictions change over time for each type of
transaction). In order to assess the effectiveness of controls, it is important to capture the
intensive margin, i.e. how restrictive the controls are for each asset class and how they change
over time. To give an analogy from measurement of monetary policy, the annual indices (e.g.
Chinn-Ito) would count the number of monetary instruments a country has in operation (set at a
non-zero value) in a given year, for example, interest rates, reserve requirements, asset purchases
etc. It would not measure how these instruments change within the year (e.g.: interest rate
increases or decreases).
The recent literature has tried to improve the measurement of the intensive margin by
collecting data on changes in regulations (Pasricha, 2012; Forbes et al., 2015; Pandey et al.,
2015). The benefit of this approach is that it allows us to precisely capture the nature of the
policy intervention as well as the date of the intervention. However, the question of whether
different policy actions are comparable over time and across countries continues to be as relevant
for these datasets as for the older, less granular datasets of extensive margins. To return to the
monetary policy analogy, the post-Brexit BoE monetary policy package included a decrease in
the Official Bank Rate, a term lending scheme, a corporate bond buying program and an
expansion of the government asset purchase program – should it count as one policy action or
more? 9 This comparability of actions becomes more pressing for studies that seek to assess the
impact of controls, rather than just the broad direction of policy.
2.1. Constructing a comparable measure of capital control actions
An improvement in the comparability of quantitative measures of policy actions (or
policy changes) is essential if the aim is to precisely evaluate the impact of changes in controls,
particularly in a cross-country context. Past studies have used different approaches to address
this question. These approaches can broadly be grouped under two headings: the “splitting-theannouncements” approach and computing the tax equivalent of certain changes (which captures
the economic size of the measure). In this article, we suggest a third approach, which combines

elements of both approaches: split the announcements and then weigh them according to their
importance for the economy in question. This gives us a database that is closer to instrument
level than other recent cross-country datasets on capital control actions.
The “splitting-the-announcements” approach aims to arrive at policy actions that are all
relatively homogeneous and are expected to have a quantitatively similar impact on capital flows
by decomposing a complex change in controls into its smaller, more homogenous
subcomponents. Major policy announcements are split into smaller, more homogeneous ones.
This approach is used by Pasricha (2012), Chantapacdepong and Shim (2015), Forbes et al.
(2015) and Pandey et al. (2015), and necessarily involves the use of judgment. Forbes et al.
(2015) drop all “very minor changes” and those that can be reasonably judged to have not been
motivated by macroeconomic or macro-prudential management concerns, but rather by foreign
policy or other domestic policy concerns. This approach still leaves a large number of changes of
varying intensity.
Pasricha (2012) controls for the degree of restrictiveness of capital controls by classifying
changes into eight different asset classes and decomposing them, within each asset class, into
quantitative, monitoring and price-based measures. 10 The asset classes include direct investment,
capital and money market instruments, real estate transactions, etc. A policy change is a change
in regulation related to one asset class. When a policy announcement has an impact on more than
one asset classes, it is counted as many times as the number of asset classes it affects.
Pandey et al. (2015) go further in this direction by counting separately every regulatory
instrument for controls on foreign borrowing in India. This yields a very detailed dataset with
actions for each policy instrument. However, this methodology is not easily scalable for
comparing changes across countries with different regulatory structures and regimes.
The second approach to improving the comparability of policy measures is to compute an
implicit tax rate of the measures. This approach has been used in the literature on evaluating
Chile’s capital controls (Valdés-Prieto and Soto, 1996; De Gregorio et al., 2000), and has
recently been followed by Baba and Kokenyne (2011). 11 A limitation of this approach, however,

10
Price-based changes are those that seek to restrict or influence the price of transactions, such as, for example, taxes on inflows, reserve
requirements (as a tax equivalent is easily computed for these) and ceilings on interest rate payable on foreign borrowings. Monitoring changes
are those that require parties to submit information to the authorities on the transactions undertaken or to obtain approval in advance. Quantitative
changes are the residual category and include limits on the size of transactions, minimum stay requirements on new inflows and all other
restrictions that are neither price-based nor monitoring.
11
Baba and Kokenyne (2011) count the non-price changes by AREAER category, but with 13 asset classes instead of the 8 used in Pasricha
(2012).

7
is that the effective tax rate can only be computed for certain kinds of policy instruments (e.g.
unremunerated reserve requirements), which constitute a minority of the actions taken by
EMEs. 12
In this article, we combine elements of both approaches. We follow Pasricha (2012) and
count the policy changes separately, decomposing them into several categories. We subsequently
weigh the changes by the share of the country’s total international assets or liabilities that the
measure is designed to influence. The weighting captures the degree of economic importance of
the measure, in the same spirit as the tax equivalence.
A policy action in our dataset has a unique classification along six dimensions:
1. The direction of flows the measure regulates: Controls on resident liabilities
(including on repayment of these liabilities) are called inflow controls and those
on residents’ external assets (including on the sale of these assets and repatriation
of the funds) are called outflow controls;
2. The policy stance of the change: Easing or tightening or restrictions;
3. The type of CFM: Controls that discriminate based on residency are called
capital controls and those that discriminate based on currency are called currencybased measures;
4. Whether the restriction is prudential or not;
5. The International Investment Position (IIP) category: Portfolio flows, FDI,
Financial Derivatives, Other Investment;
6. The type of instrument: Price-based, quantitative or monitoring.
For the initial data on CCAs, we follow the more comprehensive approach used in
Pasricha (2012) of supplementing information in the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements

and

Exchange

Restrictions

(AREAER)

with

regulators’

press

releases/notifications, news sources, and other research papers. We have information on the date
of announcement and when the policy action entered into force. 13 We use the effective dates of
the CCAs.

12

Most quantitative or monitoring measures (e.g. changes in limits of total foreign portfolio investment) are not amenable to this transformation.
Quantitative and monitoring capital control actions (CCAs) constitute about 80% of our database, while the price-based measures constitute the
remaining 20%.
13
The effective date differs from the announcement date for 16% of the actions.

A change that influences all asset classes of inflows (or outflows) has the highest weight

the other macroeconomic variables as it controls for the size of the change. A change in capital

controls that affects only a small portion of a country’s foreign transactions is unlikely to lead to
a large change in net capital inflows. A change that affects all the asset classes is likely to have a
greater impact.
This approach allows us to obtain the most comparable dataset to date on capital control
actions for a large number of economies and for a recent period, covering more than a decade.
Our dataset contains changes in capital account regulations for 16 major EMEs between 2001
and 2012. It contains 782 CCAs at a daily frequency, which after weighting, sum to 228 CCAs
(less than the number of unweighted changes as many measures do not affect all asset classes
and thus receive a weight of less than 1).
To assess the impact of weighting scheme on the distribution of actions over time, we can
compute the weighted and unweighted share of actions in period s:

When 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 > 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠 , the average weight for policy actions in period s is greater than the

average weight across all periods. This means that the policy actions in period s (by country i)
were relatively more broad-based, i.e. affected larger portions of the country’s balance sheet than
the average measure. Figure 1 plots the 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑠𝑠 and 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 series (i.e. 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 summed over all

countries). The weighted and unweighted changes show a similar pattern over time. The number
of modifications to capital controls reached a peak in the pre-global financial crisis years, 200708, when net capital inflows to these economies were surging, before declining sharply during
the crisis. EMEs’ reliance on capital control policies recovered after the crisis. The weighted
series lies above the unweighted series in the years up to 2006, but below the unweighted series

9

10
from 2006 to 2011. This suggests that the changes introduced up to 2006 were more broad-based
than changes introduced after 2006. 15

Where 𝐽𝐽𝑠𝑠 is the total number of actions in period s. Therefore, 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the (weighted)

net increase in openness of country i in period s, 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the weighted net tightening of inflow

controls and 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the weighted net easing of outflow controls by country i in period s. The

variables 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 thus target the net change in residents’ liabilities to non-residents

and the net change in residents’ claims on non-residents, respectively.

These three measures of the net direction and intensity of policy are related in the
following way:
𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(10)

The change in capital account openness is the sum of the number of outflow easing
actions and the number of inflow easing actions (all measures are weighted). In other words, the
change in openness increases with measures that ease inflow or outflow restrictions and it
declines with measures that tighten inflow or outflow restrictions.
For domestic effects, the main capital control variable is the change in capital account
openness (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). We choose this capital control variable for our specification for domestic

effects because the opening (or closing) of the capital account represents one of the corners of
the trilemma. According to the trilemma, a more open capital account could increase exchange
rate stability but only if a country gives up monetary policy autonomy. Or, greater capital
account openness could come with an increase in monetary policy autonomy, but in that case the
exchange rate would be less stable.
Given that the policy debate on spillovers has focused on inflow controls by some EMEs
re-directing global liquidity towards other emerging markets, we use foreign net inflow
tightening as our main capital control variable in our assessment of multilateral effects. The
choice of foreign net inflow tightening for assessing spillover effects is also based on the
empirical evidence that flows from EMEs to other EMEs are still rather small (Karolyi et al.,
2015). Finally, it is also possible to group the measures into whether they would encourage or
discourage net capital inflows (NKI), i.e. the difference between inflows and outflows. It allows
us to see a visual correspondence between the direction of policy and the intended outcome
variable, net capital inflows. Since both outflow easing and inflow tightening would tend to

11

12
reduce the pressure of net capital inflows, we define net NKI restricting measures (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )

as a summary measure of the degree of restrictiveness towards net capital inflows:
𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(11)

To sum up, the change in openness is a summary measure of the policy stance towards
capital account liberalization and can be directly linked to the trilemma, while net NKI
restricting measures capture the degree to which policies aim at discouraging net capital inflows.

3. Recent trends in capital controls
Capital control actions in EMEs since 2000 have largely mirrored fluctuations in net
capital inflows into these economies, as illustrated by the evolution of net NKI restricting
measures over time (Figure 2). EME policy turned sharply restrictive during the years
immediately preceding the global financial crisis following a surge in net capital inflows. The
number of net NKI restricting measures turned negative during 2008Q4-2009Q1 as the events
during the global financial crisis engendered EME attempts to reverse the sudden stop. In 2010,
however, the number of NKI restricting measures picked up sharply again, following a recovery
in capital inflows into EMEs. This pick-up in capital inflows reflected the relatively strong
growth performance of EMEs and accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies.
With the reversal in capital inflows in mid-2011, EME policy switched to policies that
encouraged net capital inflows. Although the reversal in capital inflows in 2011 proved
temporary, and EMEs saw relatively large net capital inflows during 2012, the policy stance
continued to be welcoming toward net inflows.

Note: Net private capital inflows exclude government and monetary authority transactions from “other”
inflows and outflows. Net private capital inflows are therefore the sum of FDI, net portfolio inflows, net
“private” other inflows and net derivative inflows, and are calculated on a quarterly basis as averages over
16 EMEs using seasonally adjusted data. Net NKI restricting measures is the difference between NKI
reducing capital control actions (inflow tightening and outflow easing) and NKI increasing actions (inflow
easing and outflow tightening). All measures are weighted and refer to unannounced CCAs. The number of
measures represent totals for 16 EMEs.

Figure 2. Net NKI restricting capital control measures exhibit a cyclical pattern

Although capital control policies have mostly been aimed at restricting net capital inflows
since the early 2000s, countries took measures that increased the openness of the capital account
most of the time, as NKI restricting measures were partly implemented via net outflow easing
(Figure 3a). The sample period was characterized by a net relaxation trend of both inflow and
outflow controls, resulting in an increase in capital account openness. However, inflow
liberalization slowed or reversed, and outflow liberalization accelerated during periods of high
net capital inflows. Inflow liberalizations were stepped up during periods of inflow weakness or
sudden stops, including the global financial crisis in 2008 (Figure 3b). Inflow tightening actions,
by contrast, were concentrated in periods of greater net capital inflows, including the periods
preceding the global financial crisis (2004-05 and 2007-08) and the period immediately
13

14
following the global financial crisis (2010-11), when capital flows to emerging markets
recovered sharply. These were also periods when EMEs accelerated the liberalization of outflow
controls. 16

Figure 3. EMEs liberalized both inflow and outflow restrictions most of the time

Policy changes were sometimes of a conflicting nature from a point of view of
managing net capital inflows. For example, in 2006Q2-2007Q2, when emerging economies
faced large net capital inflows and overheating pressures, countries took a significant number of
inflow easing measures alongside adjustments that tightened inflow controls. 17 This nuances the
widespread view that policy-makers in EMEs only tighten controls in the face of a surge in
inflows to manage macroeconomic and financial stability risks, while they only ease them in
case of a sudden stop.

16
Note that there are very few tightening measures on the outflow side in the sample, because of which net easing of outflow controls largely
reflects easing of outflow controls.
17
The easing measures taken during this period applied to both hot inflows and FDI-related inflows.

4. Data and empirical strategy
Capital control policies may have an impact on a range of variables, as well as be driven
by these variables. Therefore, we estimate a system of equations for capital control actions,
capital flows, a measure of monetary policy autonomy and exchange rate volatility, treating all
these variables as endogenous. These variables are interdependent per the impossible trinity or
monetary policy trilemma, which asserts that a country can maintain only two of three policy
objectives: a fixed exchange rate, open capital markets and domestic monetary policy autonomy.
In our sample, we have 16 countries, for the period 2001Q1 to 2012Q4. Table 2 has the
list of countries. We want to capture a large and representative share of the group of emerging
economies in our sample. We therefore base our sample on the countries in the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index plus Argentina (which is in G20), but we exclude the EU countries in the index
(Czech Republic, Greece Hungary and Poland whose capital controls are constrained by EU
rules), Egypt and Taiwan (data constraints) as well as Greece, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates (not yet part of the MSCI index when our dataset was compiled). For the empirical
analysis, we also drop observations for Argentina and Turkey prior to 2004Q1 and for Russia
prior to 2002Q1, to exclude their crisis periods.
4.1. Baseline model I: Effectiveness of domestic capital control changes
Our baseline model is a panel VAR (PVAR) in which all variables of interest are treated
as endogenous, while controlling for several exogenous push factors. Our model is represented
by a system of equations, which can be written in reduced-form as:

(1)

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = 𝑎𝑎0 +𝐴𝐴1 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 +. . . +𝐴𝐴𝑝𝑝 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−𝑝𝑝 + 𝐵𝐵1 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 +. . . +𝐵𝐵𝑞𝑞 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−𝑞𝑞 + 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡

where yt is a (k × 1) vector of endogenous variables for country i, xt is a (k × 1) vector of
exogenous variables common to all countries, εi,t is a (k × 1) vector of reduced-form residuals,
AJ (J = 1, …, p) and Bl (l = 1, …, q) are (k × k) matrices of coefficients for the endogenous and
exogenous variables, respectively, and di is a vector of country-specific intercepts. The inclusion
of country fixed effects aims at controlling for time-invariant omitted factors (e.g. institutional
quality) that may affect the dynamics of the system across countries.
15

16
The baseline model includes the following endogenous variables at quarterly frequency: a
capital control variable capturing the change in capital account openness (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), the
absolute value of short-term interest rate differential vis-à-vis the United States, the volatility of

the spot exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar and gross capital inflows and outflows. All
endogenous variables, except capital control variables, are included in our model in their first
difference. The reason for differencing our endogenous variables is that, in contrast to many
other studies using capital control data (e.g. Schindler/Fernandez et al. or Chinn-Ito indices), our
capital control variables are defined as changes to capital account regulations. For consistency
reasons, we also express our other endogenous variables in terms of (quarter-on-quarter)
changes. 18
We use an overall measure of capital account openness because it is difficult to
disentangle the impact of separate inflow and outflow measures given that both types of
measures tend to happen simultaneously. In our dataset, a country adjusts both inflow and
outflow restrictions in the same quarter in 48% of the quarters in which it changes a capital
control. Further, there are important differences across countries. For example, bilateral
correlations between different types of measures show that in Brazil, India, Korea and Thailand,
policy-makers tend to ease inflows and outflow restrictions in the same quarter (both measures
imply a liberalization of the capital account). In Peru, by contrast, there is a relatively high
positive correlation between net outflow easing and inflow tightening (both measures reduce net
capital inflows).
One concern with the panel specification may be the extent to which our capital controls
dataset captures cross-country variation as well as time-series variation in policy. As we
discussed in Section 2, weighting the capital control changes in our dataset by their importance
to the country’s balance sheet adds to the cross-country comparability of policy actions.
However, we also investigate the implications of using alternative indices for capital controls
that rely more on cross-sectional information, but are of a lower frequency compared with our
dataset (see Section 5.2).
Regarding the other variables, we use the absolute value of the interest rate differential as
an indicator of monetary policy autonomy. The ability to maintain a differential between
18
This is consistent with Forbes et al. (2016) which uses similar data on Brazil’s capital controls actions and assesses their impact on the changes
in portfolio allocations. Baba and Kokenyne (2011) estimate country-specific VARs using levels of macro-financial variables, but they cumulate
the capital controls policy actions to get a level measure of capital controls.

16

17
domestic and foreign interest rates (irrespective of whether it is positive or negative) serves as a
proxy for the ability to maintain a difference between desired and actual capital flows and
therefore to set domestic interest rate independently from the foreign rate. As a measure of
exchange rate volatility, we use the within-quarter standard deviation of the (log of the) bilateral
exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar. It is computed using daily data. Finally, our capital flow
variables are both gross inflows and outflows because we want to assess their responses
separately. All capital flow measures are seasonally adjusted (using the Census X12 method) and
expressed as a share of GDP. In the baseline model, we do not differentiate between FDI and
non-FDI changes given that this distinction does not play a role in the trilemma, but we do
perform robustness checks with capital flows and capital controls excluding FDI.
In addition, we include a set of exogenous variables to control for factors that may have
an impact on the endogenous variables in our model, but that are not affected by the
interdependence of the trilemma. These include three global variables: the short-term US interest
rate (federal funds rate, replaced by the shadow rate in 2009 to capture the presence of the zerolower bound for interest rates and the impact of non-conventional monetary policies), the crude
oil price and real GDP growth in the US. In addition, we add as an exogenous variable the lagged
year-over-year growth rate of domestic bank credit, following the evidence in Pasricha (2017)
that capital control policies systematically responded to bank credit. Finally, we include a
dummy for the global financial crisis. 19
In our baseline model, the number of lags p of the endogenous variables is two, while the
number of lags q of the exogenous variables is one in order to limit the number of parameters to
estimate. 20 We use the Stata program developed by Abrigo and Love (2015), and estimate the
baseline model using GMM, allowing for country heterogeneity in the levels of the variables by
introducing fixed effects and using a forward mean-differencing procedure to ensure that the
orthogonality between transformed variables and lagged regressors is preserved. As stressed by
Abrigo and Love (2015), the GMM estimator suffers from weak instrument problems when the
endogenous variables have a unit root. We run unit-root tests and find no unit roots in the capital
control variables and the other endogenous variables, which are already first-differenced.

19
As we are interested in the effectiveness of capital controls in “normal” times, we use a crisis dummy to account for the impact of crisis
episodes on the variables in our model. This dummy takes the value one during the global financial crisis (the observations from 2008Q3 until
and including 2009Q2) for all countries in the sample.
20
We test up to four lag lengths for endogenous variables and select two quarters based on standard lag length selection criteria (AIC, SBC/BIC
and HQ).

17

18
To recover the structural shocks from the VAR innovations, we adopt the recursive
Choleski decomposition identification. This decomposition provides a minimum set of
assumptions that can be used to identify the structural shocks of interest, namely the shocks to
the capital control variables. Our baseline ordering is as follows: 1) capital control measure; 2)
the absolute interest rate differential; 3) capital flows; and 4) the volatility of the spot exchange
rate vis-à-vis the US dollar. The Choleski ordering assumes that the variables that come earlier in
the ordering affect the following variables contemporaneously (as well as with a lag), while the
variables that come later affect the previous variables only with a lag. Our main identifying
assumption is that policy-makers do not react to changes in the other variables within the same
quarter as the decision-making process takes time. We opt for a relatively agnostic identification
scheme, without imposing, for example, restrictions on the impulse responses, as the direction of
the responses to shocks is the focus of our analysis. As we are agnostic about the directions and
the speed of the responses of the other variables, the structural interpretation of our model is
partial and we focus only on the impact of shocks to the capital control variable.
To sharpen the identification, we only use unannounced capital control changes, thereby
excluding changes that were announced in a quarter prior to their implementation date (except if
the announcement is in the last five days of the previous quarter). This ensures that most of the
impact of the capital controls is felt in the current or the next quarters and will be measured in
our estimates. Moreover, to check the appropriateness of the shock identification (that capital
controls do not respond contemporaneously to capital flows), we also conduct a multi-step
exercise to isolate the unexpected component of the capital control changes. We first predict
capital control policy in each EME using the predicted values of the given EME’s
contemporaneous capital flows and contemporaneous change in the exchange rate against the US
dollar. To generate the predicted values, other EMEs’ contemporaneous net capital inflows and
exchange rate changes are used as instruments, respectively. We then use the residuals of these
regressions to derive the exogenous component in capital control decisions. Finally, we test the
robustness of our results to several alternative model specifications.
Our expectations of the results are based on the predictions of the trilemma. If the
trilemma applies, a more open capital account will increase gross flows, and can change a
country’s policy configuration in three ways. First, greater capital account openness would
inevitably reduce monetary policy autonomy if policy-makers prefer a more stable exchange
18

19
rate. Second, a more open capital account could also give a country more monetary policy
autonomy, but then policy-makers would have to accept a less stable exchange rate. A third
possibility is that a more open capital account could lead to a limited reduction in both monetary
policy autonomy and exchange rate stability. 21 A combination of more monetary policy
autonomy, a more stable exchange rate as well as a more open capital account would in any case
be inconsistent with the trilemma. Our analysis can thus be an empirical test of whether the
trilemma applies, as well as an assessment of the effectiveness of changes in capital controls
(impact on gross flows).

4.2. Baseline model II: Spillover effects of capital control changes
To assess the strength of cross-country spillover effects, we use a modified version of the
baseline model by imposing more structure on the interrelations between the endogenous
variables. More specifically, we assume that the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China
and South-Africa) are affected by spillovers of capital control actions by any of the other BRICS,
but that spillovers to other EMEs arise only from the actions of the regional BRICS country. For
example, our hypothesis is that the most likely spillovers from capital control actions by India
are to the other Asian countries in the sample (e.g. Thailand or Malaysia) or to the other BRICS
(i.e. other large emerging economies) as these represent closer substitutes to India than smaller
countries in other regions (e.g. Argentina or Peru). We thus construct a count variable that, for
each of the BRICS, is the sum of the number of weighted policy changes in all the other BRICS
in a given quarter. For each of the other countries in the sample (i.e. the non-BRICS), the
variable is the sum of the number of weighted actions by the regional BRICS country (i.e. Brazil
for Latin America, China and India for Asia, Russia for emerging Europe - i.e. only Turkey in
our sample) in a given quarter. Given that capital flows from EMEs to other EMEs are still
relatively unimportant as EME residents mainly invest in advanced economies, an easing of
outflow restrictions in one EME is not expected to lead to noticeably larger gross inflows to
another EMEs. Therefore, we focus only on spillovers generated by changes in inflow controls.
The spillovers from these controls are expected to come from changes in the behavior of
21

The possibility of choosing a middle configuration, rather than a corner of the trilemma triangle, is explored in the literature that deals with the
rounding of the corners of the trilemma. For example, Aizenman, Chinn and Ito (2010, 2016) and Klein and Shambaugh (2015) explore this
empirically, while Farhi and Werning (2012) and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2012) explore theoretically the possibility that temporary capital
controls allow greater freedom for domestic macroeconomic management.

19

20
advanced economy investors, as they adjust the composition of their portfolios between different
emerging economy assets, or from the behavior of EME residents, who decide whether to invest
abroad (in advanced economies) or domestically, and in which assets.
We model the impact of spillovers of capital control actions using a structural near-VAR
approach, which differs from the standard fully symmetric structural VAR in the sense that it
constrains specific shocks to affect only some variables in the system. 22 This allows us to restrict
the coefficients for changes in capital controls in other countries to zero, implying that the
domestic variables in the system do not have an impact on capital control decisions by policymakers in other countries. Apart from these additional restrictions, compared to the model
described in Section 4.1, we replace the volatility of the spot exchange rate vis-à-vis the US
dollar with its quarter-on-quarter percentage change. Moreover, given that the focus of the
spillover analysis is not on the trilemma, but rather on the impact of inflow tightening measures
on other countries, we use those measures (i.e. 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as defined in Section 2) in this part of the
analysis rather than an overall indicator of capital account openness. All the other features of the
model (exogenous variables, number of lags) are kept unchanged.
Since the explanatory variables in each equation of a structural near-VAR are not
identical, the system of equations constitutes a Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) model,
in which the error terms are assumed to be correlated across the equations. 23 To estimate the
SUR model, we use a common variant of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, the Gibbs
sampler, which is a standard tool for posterior simulation. The results are obtained from 25000
replications from the Gibbs sampler, with 5000 burn-in replications discarded and 20000
replications retained. 24
If spillover effects are present, we expect that a tightening of inflows in BRICS would
increase capital inflows to other countries, lead to an appreciation of their currencies and reduce
their domestic interest rates relative to foreign interest rates.

5. Results: Domestic effects of capital controls

22
Near-VAR models have been employed for example by Agenor and Hoffmaister (1998) and Olson et al. (2012), and panel near-VARs by
Peersman (2004).
23
The SUR model was first proposed by Zellner (1962).
24
We choose standard uninformative priors. More specifically, we impose flat priors on the coefficients and standard Jeffrey’s prior on the
covariance matrix. For more details on the Gibbs sampler, see Koop (2003) and Doan (2009).

20

21
In this section, we investigate whether changes in capital controls have an impact on
gross capital flows, monetary policy autonomy and exchange rate stability in line with the
predictions of the trilemma. To make the impulse response functions comparable across different
samples, the impulses are standardized to a one unit shock. The responses are expressed in the
unit of each respective variable.
5.1. Results of the baseline model
Figure 4 shows the impulse response functions to a shock in capital account openness
using our baseline model based on the full sample. These impulse responses show that, following
a one unit shock to openness (i.e. an increase in capital account openness by one weighted
measure), both the absolute differential between the short-term domestic and the US interest rate
and the volatility of the exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar decline, i.e. more openness leads to
greater exchange rate stability and less monetary policy autonomy. These impacts are
statistically significant and occur quickly after the shock, but they are short-lived. For exchange
rates the entire impact occurs within one quarter, while for interest rates the impact lasts up to
three quarters. The longer impact on interest rates suggests that the loss in monetary policy
autonomy lasts longer than the gain in exchange rate stability. In both cases, the impacts peak in
the same quarter during which the shock takes place.
Policy-makers in EMEs thus gave up some of their monetary policy autonomy during the
2000s. After taking steps to dismantle capital controls, they probably gave greater priority to
exchange rate stability rather than monetary policy autonomy. This trade-off between capital
mobility, exchange rate stability and monetary policy autonomy is consistent with the predictions
of the trilemma. Within the triangle of the trilemma, the policy preference chosen by EMEs
implies a movement away from the corner of the triangle that represents monetary policy
autonomy towards more capital mobility and a more stable exchange rate.
Using the coherence between the domestic and the foreign interest rate as a proxy for
monetary policy autonomy is a standard approach in the literature (Obstfeld, Shambaugh and
Taylor, 2005). One could, however, debate whether a reduction in absolute interest differential
reflects a loss of monetary policy autonomy for countries where exchange rate pass-through to
inflation is high and inflation expectations are not well anchored. In these situations, in response
to an exogenous shock stemming from a tightening of US monetary policy, a decline in the
21

22
absolute interest differential vis-à-vis the US may well be in line with the domestic inflation
mandate (Vegh, 2017 and Tapia, 2017).
In this context, we note three points: first, we are testing the impact of a shock to capital
controls, a domestic policy variable, on other domestic policy variables as well as foreign
exchange volatility and capital flows, holding other things, including exogenous variables,
constant.

Second, in a scenario of a tightening of US monetary policy, while an optimal

monetary policy response in the absence of capital controls may be a tightening of domestic
monetary policy (i.e. a pro-cyclical monetary policy, which leaves constant or reduces the
absolute interest differential with the US), capital controls are used precisely to provide space for
monetary policy to maintain a countercyclical rather than a pro-cyclical stance. The
implementation of capital controls may, in the short run, provide the monetary space needed to
adjust the domestic interest rate, mitigating the exposure to greater real exchange rate instability
associated with short-term capital flows that may react to US monetary policy innovations.
Finally, we note that the trilemma constrains the functioning of most monetary regimes,
including the various versions of inflation targeting. We do not have the detailed data required
to test the unresolved issues with the trilemma. For example, we are unable to control for the
degree to which inflation expectations are anchored. We rely on our identification strategy as a
reduced-form approach that captures some of these issues. Testing these issues in more detail
will require more data and is left for future research.
The changes in trilemma configuration occur through changes in gross flows. Figure 4
shows that an increase in capital account openness leads to a statistically significant increase in
both gross capital inflows and outflows. Similar to the other variables in the model, these
impacts are quick and short-lived as they die out after one quarter. An increase in capital account
openness is thus associated with an increase in capital flows. While both in- and outflows
increase, our model simulations using net instead of gross flows show that the effect on net
capital inflows is not significant. This result is in line with findings in the literature that suggest
that capital controls affect gross rather than net capital flows (Ahmed and Zlate, 2014). These
findings also confirm a stylized fact from the empirical literature that shows that capital account
liberalization has historically generated large gross capital in- and outflows, but the direction of
net flows has depended on many factors (Bayoumi and Ohnsorge, 2013). These factors may
include the (relative) business cycle, growth expectations and whether capital account
22

23
liberalization is embedded in a broader reform package that strengthens the attractiveness of the
country as an investment destination. Finally, our results also support the theoretical work by
Bartolini and Drazen (1997), who show that capital account liberalization can provide signals of
future government policies, implying that a removal of controls on outflows can lead to an
increase in inflows.

Note: The lines show the impact of a one unit (i.e. one measure) increase in capital account openness, using
weighted capital control changes. The shaded areas denote the 90% confidence intervals. The responses are
expressed in the unit of each variable (exchange rate volatility: q-o-q changes in the standard deviation of
the daily changes in the exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar during each quarter; 3-month money market
interest rate differential: q-o-q change in the absolute value of the differential, in percentage points; capital
flows: q-o-q changes in seasonally-adjusted flows expressed as a percentage of GDP).

Figure 4. Domestic impact of an increase in capital account openness - baseline

The observation that capital-control policy matters mostly for gross flows and not for
their net movement, but nevertheless affects exchange rates and monetary policy autonomy
reflects the possibility that prices can adjust without a change in underlying flows (Rey, 2017;
Froot and Ramodarai, 2005). Price changes may take place, for example, due to shifts in
expectations, changes in order flows (Gyntelberg et al., 2018; Fan and Lyons, 2003) or
alterations in the composition of flows due to portfolio rebalancing (Alpanda and Kabaca, 2015).
23

24
In fact, Alpanda and Kabaca (2015) also show that the portfolio rebalancing can lead to
spillovers in the form of shifts in gross flows and risky longer term rates, without necessarily
having an impact on net flows.
5.2. Time series vs. cross-sectional variation in capital controls
It is important to note that the above results are based on both the time-series and the
cross-section dimension of the data. Our dataset captures the time dimension of the data with a
high degree of precision, which is crucial given that the effects of capital control changes tend to
be short-lived. The cross-sectional comparability of capital control actions is captured mainly via
the country-fixed effects and, to a lesser extent, by the splitting of announcements and weighting
of the changes based on a country’s international balance sheet position. The identification of the
shocks therefore not only relies on the time dimension of the data, but also on the relative
importance of a capital control change in comparison with other countries.
In order to investigate whether the cross-sectional variation in capital controls can be
better exploited, we re-run our model using the Chinn-Ito (Chinn-Ito, 2008) and Fernandez et al.,
2016 indices for capital controls. As before, all variables are included in their first difference. 25
These indices capture the cross-country variation in the level of financial openness, but they are
weaker on the time dimension given their construction methodology and annual frequency. The
main difference between both indices is that the Chinn-Ito index is a broader measure of
financial openness, covering also restrictions to the current account of the balance of payments
and on the foreign exchange market, while the Fernandez et al. (2016) dataset is narrower,
focusing only on capital transactions, but has more information on intensity of restrictions, with
disaggregated data on capital controls on various asset classes. 26 To the extent that countries
remove or add restrictions on particular asset classes over time, the Fernandez et al. (2016) index
would capture more of the time variation in the data than Chinn-Ito index.
The results using the Chinn-Ito do not confirm the trade-offs of the trilemma (Figure 5).

rate differential and exchange rate volatility. The responses using the Fernandez et al. (2016)

25
To capture the cross-sectional variation in the Chinn-Ito and Fernandez et al. (2016) indices in an alternative manner, we also perform the
analysis using the levels of these indices (each in a separate regression) together with our own index and examine the impact of a shock to the
latter (while dropping the country-fixed effects). In that case, the effects on most variables are not significant, with the exception of a downward
impact on exchange rate volatility.

index are in the same direction as those using our dataset, but for gross flows they are not
significant (Figure 6). This suggests that annual indices that primarily capture the level of capital
account restrictiveness may not be optimal for assessing the impact of capital control changes.
Higher frequency data are able to pick up the short-term tightening and easing of policies more
accurately, and therefore better reflect the cyclical variations in the intensity of restrictions.

5.3. Shock identification based on first-stage regressions for capital controls
The impulse responses can only be given a structural interpretation if we capture the truly
exogenous component of the shock. One potential concern in this regard is that decisions on
capital controls may be taken in response to changes in economic or financial conditions, for
example, to respond to capital inflow pressures or because of macroprudential concerns
(Aizenman and Pasricha, 2013; Forbes et al., 2015; Pasricha, 2017).
To isolate the component of the capital control change that is not endogenous, we follow
a three-step approach. First, to account for contemporaneous capital inflow pressures, we
instrument net capital inflows (spot exchange rate change vis-à-vis the US dollar) in quarter t
using the contemporaneous and the one-quarter lagged net capital inflows (spot exchange rate
26

27
change vis-à-vis the US dollar) in other EMEs. Second, we use the predicted net capital inflows
and spot exchange rate changes in a regression that explains capital control changes. Finally, we
use residuals from the second stage regressions on capital controls, to derive the part of capital
control actions that is not predicted by contemporaneous net capital inflows and exchange rate
change, as the endogenous variable in the structural PVAR.
Table 1 reports the results of the second step of our approach. The estimates show that
the capital control actions in our dataset do not seem to be taken in response to capital inflow
pressures, providing some evidence of their ability to capture the exogenous component of a
policy change. 27

Table 1. First-stage regressions to model capital control policies

When we use the residual of this first-stage regression as a measure of exogenous capital
control actions, the results confirm, not surprisingly, our earlier findings. The size of the impacts
is similar to those in the baseline model and the effects are still statistically significant. In fact,
the confidence intervals of the impulse responses are narrower than in the baseline model. The
smaller size of the impacts and the narrower confidence bands suggest that this multi-step
approach captures the exogenous shock to capital controls somewhat better than in the baseline
model without changing the key result.

27

The rather low R2 of the models may also reflect the presence of a non-linear relationship and/or the large number of quarters when there is no
change in policy.

5.4. The role of foreign exchange reserves
Recent literature has argued that reserves are a fourth dimension in the trilemma,
allowing countries to circumvent the constraints on policy choices posed by the trilemma.
Countries may accumulate international reserves in order to achieve some target combination of
exchange rate stability, monetary policy autonomy and capital account openness (Aizenman et
al., 2010). More specifically, the accumulation of large foreign reserve holdings by some EMEs
during the 2000s might have allowed countries to mitigate the loss in monetary policy autonomy
while stabilizing their exchange rate, as their capital accounts became more open. Our results
suggest that this is the case, although the gains in terms of a more favorable trilemma
configuration are small (Figure 8). As before, the impulse responses show that an easing of
capital account regulations is followed by an increase in exchange rate stability and a loss in
monetary policy autonomy, but this loss is somewhat smaller than in the model without reserves.
28

29
At the same time, a more open capital account results in a short-lived decline in foreign reserves.
In other words, policy-makers use foreign reserves to partly absorb the loss in monetary policy
autonomy following an increase in openness. These results suggest that accumulating large
foreign exchange reserves may be attractive for countries to soften the constraints of the
trilemma, even though the gains achieved seemed to have been small. This could be an
explanation for the strong increase in foreign reserves by EMEs during the 2000s.

5.5. The impact of inflow and outflow measures
To investigate whether the impact of capital control changes depends on the type of
measure, we replace capital account openness with separate inflow and outflow measures.
However, while interpreting these results, it is important to bear in mind the caveat mentioned in
Section 4.1 that inflow and outflow measures are often used in the same quarter, and their
individual impact may be hard to disentangle. We use net inflow tightening given that EME
policy-makers during the 2000s often aimed at curbing strong capital inflows. 28 A net tightening
of inflow controls has an upward impact on the interest rate differential and increases exchange
rate volatility, while both inflows and outflows of capital decline (Figure 9). Similar to the model
with the capital account openness measure, all impacts are significant but short-lived, though the
impact on monetary policy autonomy lasts longer than that on exchange rate volatility. These
results suggest that a tightening of inflow controls, implying a less open capital account, resulted
in more monetary policy autonomy and a less stable exchange rate. The latter impact, however,
faded more quickly than the effect on monetary policy autonomy. To the extent that exchange
rate volatility temporarily increases, one may consider the inflow tightening to be only partly
effective in achieving its objectives. The results are consistent with existing literature: Edwards
and Rigobon (2009) find that a tightening of Chile’s capital controls led to an increase in
unconditional volatility of the exchange rate and attribute this to greater market segmentation of
the foreign exchange market. Further, the literature on order flow has shown that foreign
investors’ transactions in the stock market can have a different impact on exchange rates than
their transactions in bond markets (Gyntelberg et al., 2018), and that transactions by different
types of foreign investors also affect exchange rate (and therefore its volatility) differently (Fan
and Lyons, 2003). By generating order flow from different types of investors and in different
markets, capital controls could increase exchange rate volatility, at least temporarily.

28
Note that in this section, capital control variables for inflows are defined as net tightening. The expected signs of impulse responses are the
opposite of those for baseline model with net openness as the capital control variable. This facilitates interpretation, but has no impact on the size
of the estimated IRFs or their significance.

seasonally-adjusted flows expressed as a percentage of GDP).

Figure 9. Impact of a net inflow tightening

These results also show that efforts to curb capital inflows by tightening inflow
restrictions were effective in curbing gross inflows, although their impact was only short-lived.
Moreover, this impact was offset by a greater drop in gross outflows given that residents invested
less abroad as domestic interest rates increased, implying that net capital inflows were unaffected
or even increased marginally. These findings underline again the importance of looking at gross
rather than net flows when analyzing the effects of capital controls. While much of the existing
literature emphasizes the opportunities for evasion of marginal inflow controls as overall capital
account openness increases, our results suggest that the impact of controls on residents’ outflows
is another channel through which emerging economies may see their efforts to manage net
capital inflows frustrated.

Note: The lines show the impact of a one unit (i.e. one measure) increase in net outflow easing, using
weighted capital control changes. The shaded areas denote the 90% confidence intervals. This model also
includes net inflow easing as endogenous variable. The responses are expressed in the unit of each variable
(exchange rate volatility: q-o-q changes in the standard deviation of the daily changes in the exchange rate
vis-à-vis the US dollar during each quarter; 3-month money market interest rate differential: q-o-q change
in the absolute value of the differential, in percentage points; capital flows: q-o-q changes in seasonallyadjusted flows expressed as a percentage of GDP).

Figure 10. Impact of a net outflow easing
Turning to the outflow side, a net easing of outflow controls increases monetary policy
autonomy, but this comes at the cost of higher exchange rate volatility on impact (Figure 10).
Exchange rate volatility declines in the next quarter while the impact on monetary policy
autonomy is no longer significant. This is consistent with the trilemma findings for more
openness in the baseline model: more of one trilemma variable (monetary policy autonomy) is
traded off against less of the other (exchange rate stability).
Looking at the impact of net outflow easing on capital flows, Figure 10 shows that there
is no clear impact on capital flows. A possible explanation why outflow easing did not have a
significant impact on capital flows may stem from the fact that most outflow easing measures
were undertaken in an environment of strong domestic economic and financial conditions. This
suggests that outflow restrictions in those circumstances may not have been binding in many

32

33
countries given the relatively abundant domestic investment opportunities in EMEs during the
sample period.
5.6. Summarizing the results for domestic effects
Our results show that policy choices in EMEs during the 2000s were shaped by the
constraints of the monetary policy trilemma. Changes to capital controls had a short-term impact
on gross capital flows, but they did not allow countries to escape the policy constraints posed by
the trilemma. Steps to dismantle capital account restrictions during the 2000s increased gross
flows and seem to have weakened monetary policy autonomy of EMEs as policy-makers gave
priority to exchange rate stability. However, net capital inflows did not change as changes in
gross inflows were offset by changes in gross outflows. The trend towards capital account
liberalization has made it easier for residents in EMEs to adjust their investment activities abroad
in response to changes in capital controls. Our results are consistent with evidence in the
literature that in the past decade EMEs have become more important as a source of capital in
addition to being a recipient of capital, implying that the behavior of net capital flows depends
more than in the past on resident flows than on non-resident flows (Karolyi et al., 2013; Forbes
and Warnock, 2012).
The above findings on the policy trade-offs of the trilemma are robust to several
modifications of our model. The robustness checks we perform include alternative capital control
variables (those excluding FDI), alternative indicators for monetary policy autonomy using the
Aizenman-Chinn-Ito index of monetary policy autonomy (Aizenman et al., 2010) and the
nominal short-term interest rate differential instead of its absolute value, alternative Choleski
orderings for the interest rate differential, the exchange rate, international reserves and capital
flows, and a different number of lags for the endogenous variables (i.e. three instead of two
quarters).
We also test the sensitivity of the results controlling for additional exogenous variables,
specifically the VIX index and global liquidity (world M2/GDP). We find a consistent direction
of impulse responses. However, the confidence intervals surrounding the impulse responses of
the variables of interest, particularly for gross flows, are wider than in the baseline model. This
may be due to the fact that these additional global variables are highly correlated with the US
federal funds rate, as well as with the changes in capital account openness.

6. Results: Multilateral effects of capital controls
Capital flow measures in EMEs could spill over to other economies by increasing or
decreasing flows to countries with similar characteristics or in the same region, or have an
impact on the other variables of the trilemma in those countries. Understanding the multilateral
implications of capital control policies is relevant for several reasons. First, capital control
actions by some capital-receiving countries may deflect capital towards other recipient countries
that do not impose such controls and exacerbate their overheating pressures or domestic financial
imbalances. Second, capital controls may have the effect of hampering or postponing external
adjustment, for example when inflow controls are used to sustain an undervalued currency.
Empirical evidence of cross-country spillovers using detailed data on capital control
changes remains scant. 29 In this section, we use the structural VAR model described in Section
4.2 to analyze these externalities for CCAs in the BRICS. We first look at the evidence for the
full sample in a panel setting and then we analyze interactions between specific countries in
country-by-country VARs.
6.1. Results of the baseline model
Figure 11 shows impulse responses using our model with spillover effects for net inflow
tightening (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as defined in Secion 2), based on the full sample. We use net inflow

tightening measures instead of the overall measure of openness 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as the focus of this

analysis is not on the trilemma, but on those policies that generate cross-border spillovers. As
discussed in Section 4.2, we expect cross-border spillovers to be caused mainly by inflow rather
than outflow measures. This expectation is in line with our findings comparing the domestic
impact of inflow and outflow measures on capital flows discussed in Section 5.5. In this model,
spillover effects are defined as spillovers from any of the BRICS countries to the other BRICS or
from any of the BRICS to the other countries in the same region. We find clear evidence that a
tightening of inflow restrictions creates significant, temporary spillovers to other countries.

29
A recent event study by Forbes et al. (2016) suggests that capital flow measures in Brazil spilled over to other countries. Giordani et al. (2017)
find that capital controls during 1995-2009 deflected capital flows to other countries with similar economic characteristics, but they do not find
evidence of a policy response in those countries. While Forbes et al. use data on capital control actions, Giordani et al. use annual data on levels
of capital controls.

34

35
In more detail, net inflow tightening measures in BRICS spill over to other EMEs by
initially increasing (gross) capital inflows into those countries and by placing upward pressure on
their currencies (Figure 11). This coincides with a temporary downward impact on short-term
interest rates, as authorities may respond by lowering interest rates (to make capital inflows less
attractive), although that impact is not statistically significant. These effects occur immediately,
i.e. in the same quarter during which the shock takes place. To curb those capital inflows and
counter the upward pressure on the currency, the domestic authorities react by tightening inflow
restrictions (outflow restrictions are also eased, but that impact is not significant). This policy
reaction is effective and leads to a reversal of the capital inflow reaction in the following quarter,
which turns into a decline that broadly offsets the initial upward impact on capital inflows. This
decline in capital inflows is comparable with our findings for the domestic impact of a tightening
of inflow restrictions discussed in Section 5. 30 As capital inflows fall, the appreciation of the
currency peters out (but is not reversed) and domestic interest rates are increased vis-à-vis the
US. Domestic interest rates may reflect a policy response to stem capital inflow reversals. The
resulting higher rates of return on domestic investments induce residents to invest more
domestically and gross outflows decline in the second and third quarter after the shock in foreign
capital controls.

Note that as the models in Section 5 and here are different, any comparison between the two models should be qualitative only. Moreover, the
impact on capital inflows shown in Figure 11 is not the result of the tightening of domestic inflow restrictions only, but reflects the combination
of foreign and domestic capital control shocks.

Note: The lines show the impact of a one unit (i.e. one measure) increase in foreign net inflow tightening,
using weighted capital control changes. The shaded areas denote the 16 and 84 percentiles. The responses
are expressed in the unit of each variable (exchange rate: q-o-q percentage changes; 3-month money market
interest rate differential: q-o-q change in the absolute value of the differential, in percentage points; capital
flows: q-o-q changes in seasonally-adjusted flows expressed as a percentage of GDP).

Figure 11. Inflow and outflow measures – Spillover effects: Impulse responses in the baseline
model
Our finding that capital controls entail spillovers to policy in other countries is supported
by theory, but we are among the first to find empirical evidence supporting such spillovers.
Giordani et al. (2017) present a model in which an increase in capital controls causes a similar
policy response in another country. The increase in capital inflows into the recipient country as a
result of a tightening of capital controls in another country exacerbates the negative externality
36

37
and triggers a policy reaction in the recipient country to tighten its own capital controls.
However, Giordani et al. (2017) do not find empirical support for this preposition. The most
likely explanation seems to be the fact that their dataset for capital controls (based on the
Fernandez et al. (2016) index) does not capture the intensive margin of capital controls and is
thus less suited for this type of analysis (see Section 5.2).
6.2. Have spillovers changed over time? Pre- vs. post–global financial crisis
Given the increased size and volatility of capital flows to EMEs (IMF, 2011b), the
question comes up whether the importance of spillover effects has increased over time. To
investigate this, we split the sample into two parts: the years before the start of the global
financial crisis (2001Q1-2008Q2) and the years after the crisis (2009Q3-2012Q4). Figure 12,
which reports the results for the pre-crisis period, shows more mixed results for the significance
of spillover effects than Figure 13, which covers the post-crisis period.
The results in Figure 12 show that, before the crisis, net inflow tightening measures in
BRICS led to an initial appreciation of other countries’ currencies and increase in their shortterm interest rates. Policy-makers in other EMEs reacted by easing outflow restrictions, which
was followed by a reversal in the initial impact on exchange rates and interest rates. Later, inflow
restrictions were also tightened and capital flows did not exhibit a statistically significant
reaction. However, the size of most responses, in particular for the exchange rate, is several
times smaller than those in the full sample and there is no significant impact on capital flows
before the crisis. Overall, the spillover effects of capital control changes before the crisis seems
to have been rather muted.
After the global financial crisis the evidence for spillovers becomes substantially
stronger. Figure 13 shows that a net tightening of foreign inflow controls leads to an immediate
appreciation of other countries’ currencies and increases their gross capital inflows. In the
following quarters, these impacts come to an end as domestic inflow controls are tightened, gross
capital inflows decline and the short-term interest rate differential increases. The increase in the
domestic interest rate (relative to US rates) induces domestic residents to invest less abroad,
which is illustrated by a (short-lived) decline in gross capital outflows.

6.3. Are there differences across countries?
Spillovers from changes in capital controls seem to be stronger in Latin America than in
Asia. Figure 14 shows that net inflow tightening measures in Brazil have a significant impact on
net capital inflows and the exchange rate in other Latin American countries, which lasts one
quarter. While the increase in capital inflows is more than offset by a decline in the following
quarter as the appreciation of the currency is more permanent. To reduce inflow pressure, other
countries in Latin America immediately ease capital outflow restrictions, although that does not
39

40
have a significant impact on gross capital outflows. In fact, these flows decline as domestic
short-term interest rates increase relative to foreign interest rates.

GDP).

Figure 15. Spillover effects: Asia

In Asia, we find a similar pattern for spillovers of measures in China/India on the other
Asian countries, but the impacts are much smaller than in Latin America (Figure 15). For
example, the impact of Brazilian inflow tightening measures on net capital inflows and exchange
rates of other Latin American countries is larger (6% average quarter-on-quarter appreciation in
the same quarter) than the impact of inflow tightening measures in India and China on other

41

42
Asian countries (less than 1% average appreciation in the same quarter). This may reflect the
relatively closed capital accounts of China and India as well as other Asian EMEs in the sample
relative to Brazil and the other Latin American EMEs. The larger size of the spillovers via
exchange rates in Latin America should also be seen in conjunction with the fact that exchange
rate fluctuations in most Latin American countries during our sample were larger than those in
Asia.
Focusing on spillovers among the five BRICS countries only, we find that multilateral
effects among these countries are similar to those for the full sample, with one key difference
relating to the domestic policy reaction (Figure 16). Compared to the full sample, there is a
stronger domestic tightening of inflow controls in response to the policy actions in other BRICS,
and no domestic easing of outflow controls. As in the full sample, this policy reaction leads to a
reversal of the initial impact on capital inflows and interest rates and reduced upward pressure on
the currency, although the currency appreciation observed immediately after the shock is not
offset by a subsequent depreciation. A tightening of inflow controls in BRICS countries therefore
not only leads to permanently stronger exchange rates in other, similarly-sized EMEs, but it also
triggers an adverse dynamic that results in less open capital accounts.
So far, we have based our results on the full sample or regional sub-samples, assuming
that a uniform panel structure can be imposed on all these country groups. As economic and
financial structures and policy frameworks differ across countries, we also analyze the spillover
effects using country-specific models. These models are more parsimonious since the number of
observations in the country-specific samples is much more limited. In the country-specific
models we drop two endogenous variables (domestic net outflow easing and gross outflows) and
focus on the response of the remaining variables. Table 2 summarizes our results for the
individual countries using country-specific structural VARs. The following points are
noteworthy.

Figure 16. Spillover effects: BRICS

First, our analysis for individual countries confirms that the most common channel for
spillovers runs via exchange rates rather than capital flows. In fact, for almost all countries
shown in Table 2, inflow tightening measures taken in their BRICS neighbors generate
significant spillovers via the exchange rate. The key role of exchange rates as a transmission
channel for these shocks suggests that, to the extent that they are not accompanied by movements
in net capital flows, capital control changes in the BRICS may have an impact on exchange rate
43

44
expectations in other EMEs. The finance literature confirms that exchange rates/prices can adjust
without a change in the underlying flows/trades, for example in response to macroeconomic
news (see e.g. Froot and Ramadorai, 2005).

This table summarizes the country-specific results. Y = significant impact with expected sign; (Y) = significant
impact with expected sign with delay; N = no significant impact; (N) = significant impact with unexpected sign. W
= “wall”, i.e. a country with extensive and long-standing capital controls; G = “gate”, i.e. a country with less
extensive controls or practically no controls. This classification is based on Klein and Shambaugh (2015).

Table 2. Spillover effects of BRICS capital control changes on other EMEs
Second, in contrast to earlier findings in the literature, there appears to be no clear
relationship between the importance of spillovers and the degree of restrictiveness of the capital
account. When we compare our results with the classification of countries into “walls”, i.e.
countries with extensive and long-standing capital controls and “gates”, i.e. countries with less
extensive controls (Klein and Shambaugh, 2015), it seems that although most countries for
which we find spillovers tend to me more open, there is no clear pattern that sets these countries
apart from the economies with more extensive restrictions.

44

45
Finally, we perform a number of robustness checks to our analysis of spillovers. The
main results do not change if we use net capital inflows instead of gross flows, exclude FDI from
our capital flow definition, drop the seasonal adjustment for capital flows, replace our exchange
rate variable with the exchange rate volatility indicator used to analyze domestic effects or when
we look at different components of capital flows separately (FDI, portfolio and other investment
flows).

6.4. Summarizing the results for multilateral effects
To conclude, our evidence suggests that spillover effects of capital flow policies may
have been more important than generally thought. We find evidence that during the 2000s and
early 2010s capital flow management measures in large EMEs – i.e. tightening of inflow controls
– had important implications for other countries. These policies generated upward pressure on
the currencies of other EMEs, while in a more limited number of cases they also fueled gross
capital inflows to other countries. Spillovers have become larger during the post-crisis period,
which could be associated with abundant global liquidity during the years after the crisis and the
greater role of retail investment funds during this period (Miyajima and Shim, 2014). We also
find evidence of policy spillovers in the sense that policy-makers seem to tighten inflow controls
in response to spillovers from other large economies.

7. Conclusions
This article evaluates the domestic and multilateral impact of capital controls in emerging
market economies since the early 2000s. We investigate the effects of changes in capital account
openness by using a new, detailed dataset on capital control changes. Looking at the domestic
effects of capital flow measures, our main conclusion is that policy choices in EMEs during the
2000s were shaped by the constraints of the monetary policy trilemma. Steps to dismantle capital
account restrictions weakened monetary policy autonomy of EMEs as policy-makers gave
priority to exchange rate stability. A more detailed analysis of changes in monetary policy
autonomy would require more specific data on the central bank’s objectives and the external
shocks affecting the economies in question.

Measures opening the capital account also had a short-lived impact on gross capital
flows, although there was no impact on net capital inflows. These findings are consistent with
evidence in the literature that, in the past decade, EMEs have become more important as a source
of capital in addition to being a recipient of capital, implying that the behavior of net capital
flows depends more than in the past on resident flows. Our results thus suggest that resident
flows warrant attention when analyzing the impact of capital controls.
As regards spillovers, our main finding is that the cross-border effects of capital flow
policies are more important than generally thought. We find clear evidence that during the 2000s
net inflow tightening measures in large had significant implications for other countries. Capital
flow policies seem to have an impact on other countries via capital flows as well as exchange
rates. Spillovers of capital flow policies seem to have become more important over time, as
cross-border effects have been larger in the aftermath of the global financial crisis than before
the crisis. We also find evidence of policy spillovers in the sense that policy-makers seem to
tighten inflow controls in response to a tightening of inflow restrictions in the BRICS. A
tightening of inflow controls thus not only leads to economic, but also to policy spillovers that
may be sub-optimal. These spillovers point to the potential existence of a coordination problem
among countries that use capital controls as an instrument of economic policy.

Description/Source
Gross inflows are gross private capital inflows, computed as the sum of
portfolio investment inflows, other investment inflows (excluding monetary
authority and government flows), derivative inflows, and FDI inflows. The
series are seasonally adjusted (using the Census X12 method) and expressed as
a share of domestic GDP. In the regressions this variable is included as the q-oq change in seasonally-adjusted flows expressed as a percentage of GDP.
Source: IMF-BOPS.
Gross outflows are gross private capital outflows, computed as the sum of
portfolio investment outflows, other investment outflows (excluding monetary
authority and government flows), derivative outflows, and FDI outflows. The
series are seasonally adjusted (using the Census X12 method) and expressed as
a share of domestic GDP. In the regressions this variable is included as the q-oq change in seasonally-adjusted flows expressed as a percentage of GDP.
Source: IMF-BOPS.
The proxy for monetary policy autonomy is computed as the absolute value of
the differential between the domestic short-term interest rate and the US shortterm interest rate (both expressed as a percentage per annum). The interest rates
used are short-term interest rates from Oxford Economics, except Colombia
(90-day CD rates from the Banco de la Republica) and Peru (IMF-IFS money
market rate). The US interest rate is the three-month USD LIBOR. In the
regressions this variable is included as the q-o-q change. Source: Datastream.
The spot exchange rate is expressed as the number of units of the local currency
per US dollar, with an increase implying a depreciation of the local currency. In
the regressions it is included as the q-o-q percentage change. Source:
Bloomberg.
The exchange rate volatility is computed as the standard deviation of the log of
the daily spot exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar. In the regressions this
variable is included as the q-o-q change of the standard deviation.
It is computed as the y-o-y growth rate of bank credit to the non-financial
private sector. Source: BIS.
