    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze the extent and consequences of unequal representation on juries in Harris County, Texas. We first document that residents from predominantly white and high-income neighborhoods are substantially over-represented on juries. Using quasi-random variation in those called for jury duty each day, we next establish that Black defendants are more likely to be convicted and receive longer sentences from juries with more residents from these overrepresented neighborhoods. We estimate that equal representation would reduce Black defendants\u2019 median sentence length by 50% and the probability of receiving a life sentence by 67%. Straightforward remedies could mitigate these legally unwarranted racial disparities.\n\n",
