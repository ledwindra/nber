ABSTRACT
Many countries appear to have excessively stable big business sectors, in that higher rates of big business
turnover have been correlated with faster economy growth. Public policies that stabilize big business
sectors are sometimes justified as supportive of social objectives. We find no consistent link between
big business stability and public goods provision, egalitarianism, or labor empowerment. While absence
of evidence is not evidence of absence, these findings suggest that other explanations, such as special
interest politics or behavioral biases favoring the status quo also be considered.

Many countries appear to have excessively stable big business sectors, in that higher rates of big
business turnover have been correlated with faster economy growth. Public policies that stabilize
big business sectors are sometimes justified as supportive of social objectives. We find no
consistent link between big business stability and public goods provision, egalitarianism, or labor
empowerment. While absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, these findings suggest that
other explanations, such as special interest politics or behavioral biases favoring the status quo
also be considered.

Introduction

Schumpeter (1912) describes capitalism as a system in continual flux. Observing carriage makers
fall to automakers, traditional steel mills cede markets to the Bessemer process, and cotton mills
quake at the advent of rayon, Schumpeter saw capitalism’s unique forte as harnessing this turmoil
to lift humanity above its millennia-long Malthusian trap.

Creative entrepreneurs build

innovative upstart firms that destroy staid and established firms in an ongoing turmoil
Schumpeter (1942) called creative destruction. The new firms are more productive than the old
ones they displace, so aggregate wealth rises steadily as individual firms and fortunes rise and fall
– often abruptly and unpredictably. A large and rapidly solidifying body of theoretical and
empirical work, surveyed in Aghion and Howitt (1998), now confirms the essential validity of
Schumpeter’s ideas.

Given this, rescuing the losers without undermining the process of creative

destruction itself becomes a critical public policy challenge.
In a recent study, Fogel et al. (2008) show that economies whose leading businesses die
as new leading firms rise grow faster than economies whose lists of leading firms remain stable.
The key variable in that study is “big business stability” – measured as the fraction of a country’s
largest employers in 1975 that persist to 1996. Persistence is defined variously as remaining in
the top ten list, growing no slower than GDP, retaining in 1996 at least 50%, 25%, or 10% of its
1975 labor force. Using any of these measures, they show that real per capita GDP growth,

1

economy total factor productivity growth, and aggregate capital accumulation are all significantly
higher in economies with less stable big business sectors.
This finding suggests that many economies pay for excessively stable big business
sectors with depressed growth. One possibility, alluded to by Fogel et al. (2008) is that some
governments may balance other policy goals against economic growth. This is plausible, for
“man does not live by bread alone”. Indeed, the social objectives of modern societies are often
framed, as by the republican idealists of the French Revolution, in terms like “liberty, fraternity,
and equality!” A high per capita GDP can help with these, but the legitimacy of public policy
goals other than economy growth must be conceded.
Might a more stable big business sector help a country attain these goals? Toned down
creative destruction makes more predictable each firm’s future revenue streams, the composition
of the big business sector, and the identities of the people in charge. The transactions costs of
collecting tax revenues from a smaller number of larger firms, redistributing income via industrial
policies, and co-opting business into social pacts may all be lower if big businesses are longer
lived players. Big businesses might partake such transactions to maximize long-term profits, or to
assuage their controlling shareholders’ souls or egos. These arguments, developed at greater
length below, are admittedly highly tentative, and counterarguments are easy to generate. But we
seek reasons why many countries’ big business sectors appear excessively stable, so we allocate
the benefit of the doubt to these rationalizations – at least for now.
To see if this is so, we correlate big business stability with a variety of social
development indicators, controlling for per capita GDP. We find largely insignificant results
throughout, though occasionally big business stability correlates with worse social outcomes.
We speculate that the countervailing policy benefits might be either more obscure or
tightly focused on narrow interest groups. Alternatively, the well-documented conservative bias
detected elsewhere in behavioral finance may induce suboptimal policy in some countries.

The article is organized as follows: Section two provides some background to motivate
the assumption that excessive big business stability may indeed be a deliberate public policy goal.
Section three describes the data and section four the results. Section five concludes, entertains
our speculative explanations, and calls for further work.

2.

On Stability

Instances of politicians using public funds to rescue tottering corporate giants are not rare. For
example, when Philipp Holzmann AG disclosed a DM2.4 billion-mark problem in its books, its
banks demanded a comprehensive restructuring.

The Wall Street Journal (Nov. 25, 1999)

describes the subsequent politicking as follows: When the banks rejected Holzmann's DM4.3billion restructuring proposal as inadequate, a chorus of German politicians vilified the banks'
unwillingness to “shield a 150 year old German company and save the jobs of Holzmann's 17,000
domestic workers.” German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, after buying the banks' acquiescence
with a federal guarantee on a DM100 million loan and DM150 million in new capital, exulted
“The banks have recognized their economic and social responsibility.”
Such respect for corporate stability is not confined to European politicians. Business
Week (September 11, 1998) quotes an anonymous prominent businessman explaining that the
Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad “doesn't believe in bankruptcies. He has a moral
objection to them.” The Business Week article added that during the Asian crisis when “the
intensity of business collapses and bank collapses was like tenpins falling every day,” Mr.
Mahathir Mohamad “couldn't stand it. He doesn't believe in bankruptcies.”
Politicians can protect the stability of established corporate empires in less direct ways
than bailouts. Although Thai Petrochemical Industries was insolvent in 1997, the firm was not
officially declared bankrupt until 2000. According to the Wall Street Journal (February 12,
2001), the CEO, Prachai Leophairatana filed thirteen different lawsuits and a criminal
embezzlement charge against the creditors. Although the creditors have formally fired him, he

3

continues to occupy the CEO’s office and run the company. The Thai government seems unable
or unwilling to evict him.
In Africa too, government policies can tilt the playing field to favor old established firms
and undermine upstart innovators.. In the mid 1990s, the government of Zimbabwe invested a
great deal of effort to save the state telephone utility, PTC, from a cell phone company being
organized by Strive Masiyiwa, an entrepreneur.

The story, according to the National Post

(February 26, 2000), is as follows. PTC phone lines served 1.4% of Zimbabweans, and the
hundreds of thousands of people requesting new lines endured waits of up to four years and were
expected to pay large bribes to bureaucrats. When Masiyiwa proposed a joint venture with PTC
to provide cell phone service, he recounts that "They looked at me and said: 'We don't see a future
in it. We certainly aren't going to waste valuable resources on it." When Masiyiwa decided to go
it alone, PTC forbade it on the grounds that the state had a monopoly on telecommunications.
Masiyiwa hired an American lawyer, challenged PTC’s position in court, and won. He then
formed a company, Econet, and with foreign partners built base stations across the country. A
few days before service was to begin, Zimbabwe’s president Robert Mugabe, invoked emergency
presidential powers and made it illegal for a private business to build a cellular network.
Offenders would face two years in jail. Masiyiwa recounts that "Parliament sat through three
sittings to turn [the decree] into law in one day." He returned to the courts, and a judge finally
ordered that a cell phone license be put up for public tender. A string of politically connected
consortia sprung up to bid, and Telecel, a consortium backed by Leo Mugabe, the president’s
nephew and a member of parliament, won the license. Masiyiwa's salvation was an anonymous
civil servant, who leaked documents proving that a corrupt official had docked 20% from
Econet's score on the tender bid. Strive Masiyiwa should have won in the first place. After more
court battles, a cabinet shuffle, and threats of resignation from the late vice-president, Econet
finally got a license to operate. Within a week of its launch, the company had 10,000 subscribers,
and rapidly overtook Telecel and the state-run cell phone company, NetOne. As the situation in

4

Zimbabwe further deteriorated in the late 1990s, Masiyawa found it prudent to move his base of
operations to South Africa.
Anecdotal evidence is not proof, but the incidents reviewed above at least justify the
hypothesis that stabilizing a country’s big business sector might be a commonplace public policy
goal, or at least a perceived means to other policy goals, that countervail any slowing of economic
growth.
How might a stable big business sector aid in the achievement of laudable policy goals
beyond the purely economic ones?

2.1

Liberty

A more stable big business sector might ease governments’ fiscal uncertainty by providing stable
and predictable tax inflows. This might be important in funding health care, education, public
infrastructure, or other public goods that must be built up slowly over time. Some of the costs of
these goods might even be off-loaded to large stable firms. For example, many health care costs
are paid by large firms, not government, in the Unites States and Switzerland. Education costs can
also be paid by employers on occasion, as when firms pay for advanced business degrees for their
managerial staff or for technical skills upgrading for blue collar workers.
Public goods are a critical, and often overlooked, aspect of development. Amartya Sen
(1999) argues that development should be defined as that which expands human freedom.
Educated people have more options to choose from than illiterates, so better education is an
important component of development. Healthy people have more options than the chronically ill.
People living near roads, ports, and airports have more options than those isolated in impenetrable
wilderness. All of these considerations lead Sen to conclude that governments need to invest
heavily in public goods like education, infrastructure, and healthcare to provide basic necessary
freedoms to their peoples. An overly single minded focus on GDP growth is inadequate.

5

2.2

Equality

The crux of the matter might be egalitarianism. In public pronouncements explaining decisions
to support large established firms, politicians often take an instrumental perspective – a stable big
businesses sector is not desirable per se, but because it leads to other desirable public policy
outcomes, such as high quality public goods, labor rights, or an egalitarian income distribution.
Such factors apparently moved the German government’s bailout of Philipp Holzmann, which
Finance Minister Hans Eichel justified thus: “the government has a responsibility to step in if a
major German company is about to collapse and cost thousands of people their jobs”.1 A like
motive seems to underlie Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s pressing German banks to “save the
jobs” of the 22,000 employees of the bankrupt engineering firm Babcock Borsig AG with a $700
to $800 million bailout.2
If big business stability, by preserving blue collar jobs, sustains incomes across a wide
segment of the population, while letting innovative upstarts displace them benefits only a handful
of entrepreneurs, egalitarianism might bias government policies against upstarts to protect
established large firms. Governments might have to choose a balance between the rapid growth of
unfettered creative destruction and the equality attainable by slowing that process.

2.3

Fraternity

But public goods might not be the only non-economic goal at issue. Several of the politicians we
cite above proclaim big business stability desirable because it protects workers. The underlying
economics is often obscure, but this linkage may have led the Japanese government to propose a
¥200 billion ($1.90 billion) bailout of Sogo Department Stores, which Asiaweek described as part
of Japan’s long tradition of corporate bailouts designed to minimize “confusion”.3 Asiaweek

1999.

continues that, to the bewilderment of senior politicians, the bailout was derailed when “[t]he
public exploded over the use of their tax money to rescue a poorly managed private company.”
The long-term stability of large Japanese firms is sometimes stressed as economically
advantageous because it promotes implicit labor contracts, workers’ firm-specific human capital
accumulation, and otherwise reduces labor market transactions costs (Aoki, 1988). This logic
might apply to Japan, but if it were more generally valid, these economic advantages should be
evident in faster economy growth, all else equal.
But a stable big business sector might nonetheless be viewed by some politicians as a
useful tool in the art of nation building. For example, Business Week reports that Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir is unapologetic about his government’s policy of selecting a handful of
wealthy businessmen for privileges and assigning them the role of creating jobs, implementing
big projects, and keeping the economy growing. The article quotes Mustapha Mohamed of the
Finance Ministry as saying ''We view Malaysia as a corporation, and the shareholders in the
government are companies.” and that “To the extent you help the bigger guys, the smaller guys
benefit.''4 Some mixture of nation building and the promotion of social cohesion seem evident in
these remarks.
Such thinking reflects the corporatist tripartite bargaining intrinsic to many European
social democracies (Högfeldt, 2005).

In these countries, representatives of big labor, big

government, and big business periodically got together to map out economic strategies for the
entire country. Such negotiations are obviously easier if the same big businesses are represented
year after year (Roe, 2003).

Innovative and dynamic upstart big businesses may, quite

understandably, fail to adhere to tripartite agreements made by their more sedately run former
competitors. Indeed, staid established firms might even be able to use such bargains to drive

upstarts (Rajan and Zingales, 2003)

Data

Our measures of the stability of each country’s biggest businesses are from Fogel et al. (2008).
They list the biggest employers in each country in the 1975 and 1996, from Dun & Bradstreet's
Principals of International Business. These lists include a wide spectrum of businesses: listed
and unlisted firms, corporations and other businesses, as well as private sector and state
controlled enterprises (SCEs).5 This catholicism evades sample selection problems due to stock
markets, and thus listed firms, being more or less common in some economies. Enterprises not
usually considered “businesses”, such as educational institutions, medical institutions,
membership organizations, government agencies, and the like are excluded, though.
La Porta et al. (1999), Claessens et al. (2000), Faccio and Lang (2002), and others show
that large businesses outside the US and UK are often members of business groups, not
freestanding firms. Using raw data provided by those researchers, as well as data on controlling
shareholders from Hoover’s online, Worldscope, SDC, Forbes’ annual lists of billionaires,
newspaper archives, case studies, academic research papers, corporate websites, corporate
histories, and business family biographies, Fogel et al. (2008) consolidate group member firms
into business groups. They define a firm as controlled if it is so defined in any of these sources,
or if 20% or more of its stock is voted by a wealthy family, government, trust, or bank.6 The
stability of big business is thus gauged by the continued importance of the largest businesses,
whether groups or freestanding firms, in each country. This avoids problems due to intragroup
asset transfers.

However, consolidating firms into groups leaves countries like Sweden and

We use the term state controlled enterprise (SCE) rather than state owned enterprise (S.O.E.) because the
state may hold a control block without owning the firm outright.
6
La Porta et al. (1999) shows that 51% is not necessary as a single dominant shareholder can exert
effective control when all other shareholders are small. We use voting rights to assign control, for cash flow
rights and voting rights diverge substantially in some countries because of dual share classes and control
pyramids.

South Africa only a few extremely large businesses. Since even the 15th or 20th biggest business
in such countries is quite small, the stability measures define each country’s big business sector
as its ten largest employers (if there are ties in tenth place, all the ties are included).
Gauging the stability of a country’s large business sector requires determining whether or
not each leading 1975 business persist to 1996. One obvious approach is to define persist as “still
in the top ten list in 1996”. But a truly vibrant economy might admit new businesses to the top
ten, even as the 1975 top ten prosper. A more suitable definition might thus target 1975 top ten
businesses that grow no slower than GDP to 1996; though this might be inappropriate for an
economy that shrank from 1975 to 1996. Or a firm might persist if it employs no less than 50%,
25%, or 10% of its 1975 workforce in 1996.
Below, we use a combined definition – a top ten 1975 business persists if it retains top
ten list in 1996 or grow at least as fast as its country’s GDP from 1975 to 1996. Thus, we define
persistence for each 1975 top ten business I as the maximum of δi and ηi, with
[1]

⎧ 1 if i is in the top ten lists in both 1975 and 1996
⎩0 otherwise

δi = ⎨

and

Using this procedure, Fogel et al. (2008) construct various alternative stability measures

9

including or excluding financial firms, multinational subsidiaries, and sometime state controlled
enterprises in all possible combinations. Since they find two of these to be representative of the
others, so we focus here on minimally inclusive indexes Ω E and Ω L using the top ten privatesector nonfinancial domestically controlled businesses only, and maximally inclusive indexes Ω E
and Ω L that also includes sometime state-controlled enterprises, foreign controlled enterprises,
and financial firms as well. Table 1 presents summary statistics for these four measures.
Our objective is to see if big business stability, shown to correlate with slow growth by
Fogel et al. (2008) might correlate positively with offsetting laudable social outcomes. We
therefore examine a broad spectrum of measures of such outcomes.
We first consider several measures of public goods provision. These are:

Health

We use three indicators to measure the average level of public health from 1996 to 2000. “Infant
mortality” is the number of infants dying before reaching age one, per one thousand live births.
“Child mortality” is the estimated number of infants dying before reaching age five, per one
thousand live births, assuming the current age-specific mortality rates hold. “Life expectancy” is
the number of years a newborn baby would live holding the current patterns of mortality constant
throughout its life. All three indicators come from the World Development Indicators (WDI)
database online, made available by the World Bank.

Education

Measures of public expenditures on education are collected from WDI for the period of 1996 to
2000. “Public spending on education” consists of current and capital public expenditure on
education and subsidies to private education as a percentage of total GDP. We also obtain data
on “education attainment” from Barro and Lee (2001). This variable indicates the total number of
years of schooling in the adult population aged 25 or older in 1995.

10

Infrastructure

We are interested in four aspects of infrastructure essential to social economic development:
“electricity” is the net production of electric power by power plants, measured in MWh per
capita; “roads” is kilometers of paved roads as a percentage of all roads in the country;
“telecommunication” is fixed and mobile phone line subscribers per one thousand people; and
“internet” is broadband internet access subscribers per one thousand people. All four measures
are taken from WDI and are averaged from 1996 to 2000.

Pollution

We measure “water pollution” by the number of metric tons of organic water pollutant emissions
per day and “air pollution” by the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per capita.
Both measures again come from WDI and take the average values of 1996 to 2000.

Overall Quality of Life

We use the United Nation’s Human Development Index (HDI) to measure the overall quality of
life.

This index is constructed to incorporate three dimension indices capturing nations’

achievements in health, education, and standard of living relative to the best performing country
in each dimension. Specifically, the health dimension index is based on life expectancy at birth,
the education dimension on adult literacy and the gross enrollment of primary, secondary and
tertiary schools combined, and the standard of living dimension on Purchasing Power Parity
adjusted GDP per capita values in U.S. dollars. The technical note of each year’s Human
Development Report contains further details of the index construction and can be accessed at
http://hdr.undp.org. This paper uses the average HDI from 1997 to 2000.

11

To gauge each economy’s concern for inequality, we consider measures of income
distribution and abject poverty:

Poverty:

We use poverty headcount ratios to measure poverty. Poverty defined using “$1 a day” is the
percentage of the population living on less than $1.08 a day at 1993 prices, adjusted for
Purchasing Power Parity.

Poverty defined using “$2 a day” is similarly defined, with the

benchmark set at $2.15 a day. A value of 2% is assigned to countries whose poverty rate sits
below 2%. Data is averaged between 1996 and 2000 wherever possible, but is missing for 24
countries, 21 of which OECD members, plus Hong Kong, Israel, and Singapore. A value of zero
is assigned to these countries.

Income Inequality:

Gini coefficients, first introduced by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912, are widely
accepted as a measure of income inequality. To ensure robustness of results, we use two versions
of Gini coefficients, one published by the World Development Indicators (WDI) database, and
the other by the World Income Inequality Database (WIID), detailed in Deininger and Squire
(1996). The WDI data is undated, whereas the WIID data is for 1996 or the closest year
available.

Finally, we consider measures of the bargaining power of labor.

Unemployment:

We use unemployment rate as a percentage of total labor force to account for the share of the total
labor force that is currently without work but seeking employment. For robustness, we also use

12

unemployment rates by gender, similarly defined. The data is retrieved from the online WDI
database.

Labor Rights:

We use three measures of labor rights, all taken from Botero, et al. (2004). First, “union density”
is the percentage of the total labor force affiliated to labor unions in 1997. Second, “the right to
form unions” is a four-value dummy that assumes a maximum value of 1 if the country's
constitution expressly grants the right to form labor unions. The dummy is set to 0.67 if labor
unions are described as a matter of public policy or public interest, 0.33 if labor unions are
otherwise mentioned in the constitution, and 0 otherwise. Third, “minimum wage” is a dummy
variable that equals 1 if a mandatory minimum wage is either defined by statute, or established by
mandatory collective agreement and made legally binding for most sectors of the economy, and 0
otherwise.

Labor Protection:

We measure the protection of labor afforded by social security laws with indices capturing “old
age, disability, and death benefits”, “sickness and health benefits”, and “unemployment benefits”.
A higher value of the old-age benefits index means higher post-retirement life expectancy, fewer
months of contributions or employment required for normal retirement by law, lower deductions
in the worker's monthly salary to cover these benefits, and larger proportion of the net preretirement salary covered by the pension. A higher value of the sickness benefits index means
fewer months of contributions or employment required to qualify for these benefits by law, lower
deductions in the worker's monthly salary to cover these benefits, shorter waiting period, and
higher percentage of the net salary covered for a two-month sickness spell. The unemployment
benefits index is defined similarly to the sickness benefits index, with a higher value indicating
fewer months of contribution, lower deduction, shorter waiting period, and higher percentage of

13

salary covered for a one-year unemployment spell. All three indices come from Botero, et al.
(2004).

Each specific variable and its source are described in detail in Table 2. Their summary
statistics are displayed in Table 3.

4.

Findings

Section two outlined three sets of arguments as to why big business stability might be socially
desirable even if it retards economic growth somewhat. First, big business stability might permit
sustained investment in public goods. Second, big business stability might permit stronger labor
rights. Third, big business stability might level income distributions and contribute to a more
egalitarian society.
In the tables below, we first document simple correlation coefficients of the stability
variables with a set of social outcomes, and then regress the social outcome measures on stability
and per capita GDP. This is because countries with higher per capita GDP are likely to exhibit
better outcomes across a range of development outcomes – economic and social. We wish to test
for big business stability contributing to laudable social outcomes through channels other than
economic prosperity.

4.1

Public Goods

Table 4 considers the possibility that a stable big business sector permits governments to invest
more in public goods. We gauge the quality of a country’s public goods in a variety of ways. Its
health care is reflected in its infant mortality rate, child mortality rate, and overall life expectancy.
Table 4 shows lower infant and child mortality rates as well as greater life expectancies in
countries with more stable maximally inclusive lists, suggesting a possible social offset to laggard
economic growth. But these correlations disappear or switch signs after controlling for per capita

14

GDP. If anything, countries at a given level of per capita GDP that opt for big private-sector
business stability appear to exhibit both worse health care and slower economic growth.
A very important social goal is education. Measures of the quality of the countries’
education – mean education attainment and public spending on education – show no correlation
with big business stability after controlling for per capita GDP – though the simple correlations
with the maximally inclusive stability indexes are significant..
Public infrastructure is also composed of critically important public goods. Electricity
provision, the quality of roads, telecommunication infrastructure, and internet penetration all
exhibit intermittently significant positive simple correlation coefficients with the stability
indexes; but all fade to insignificance after controlling for per capita GDP.
Another set of high demand public goods pertains to environmental protection, which we
gauge by water pollution and air pollution (in terms of CO2 emissions) statistics. Worse
pollution correlates with more stable big business sectors. The correlations between air pollution
and big business stability significantly weakens after controlling for per capita GDP; however,
water pollution is highly significantly and positively associated with private sector stability even
with per capita GDP as a control variable. Finally, the United Nations assesses the overall quality
of life in each of its member countries. This can be interpreted as an overall measure of the
consumption of private and public goods by the population, for it weights health care and
education against purely economic outcomes like a high per capita GDP. Big business stability is
positively correlated with the human development index, but this correlation evaporates when we
control for per capita GDP.
If big business stability helps governments direct resources towards public goods, others
than those in Table 4 must be the focus. Insignificance cannot prove the absence of a relation, but
a tie to the quality of public goods is clearly elusive.

4.2

Income equality

15

If stable big businesses provide employment to those who would otherwise be marginalized, this
may be a public policy outcome worthy for which a few points of GDP growth might well be
sacrificed. Table 5 measures egalitarianism by each country’s GINI coefficient and by the
fraction of the population condemned to live on less than one or two dollars per day.
More stable big business sectors are actually correlated with worse inequality in the
simple correlation coefficients. If inequality is measured by the fraction of people living on less
than two US dollars per day, the table actually shows worse inequality where big business is more
stable even after controlling for per capita GDP.
If big business stability seeks to promote egalitarian outcomes, it is remarkably
unsuccessful.

4.3

Labor Power

Table 6 correlates big business stability to the status of labor in the economy. Unemployment –
total, male, and female – is utterly uncorrelated with big business stability. So are labor rights,
for unions are neither more common nor easier to form where big businesses are more stable.
Minimum wages are also not more likely to be mandatory by law; and various benefits for old
age, disability, and death or for illness are no more generous. (Though health benefits are higher
where big businesses are more stable if the visibly extreme observations of Indonesia, Malaysia,
and Sri Lanka are retained.)

Unemployment benefits appear positively correlated with big

business stability in simple correlations, but these are rendered insignificant when per capita GDP
controls are added.
If big business stability permits a greater voice for organized labor, we cannot detect it.

4.4

Robustness Checks

We conduct residual analysis and robustness checks to ensure that our results are not driven by
outliers or other statistical anomalies.

16

Generalized White tests suggest the presence of heteroskedasticity in regressions
involving public health measures, electricity, education attainment, inequality, and labor rights.
We follow White (1980) to deal with this problem by reporting heteroskedasticity-consistent
standard errors for all regressions in the tables, although using Ordinary Least Squared standard
errors does not qualitatively change the results. This exercise indicates wide tails in the social
outcome variables’ distributions, and closer inspection indicates this to mainly affect their right
tails. Substituting versions of these variables winsorized at 5% eliminates this problem, leaving
White's generalized tests indicating no heteroskedasticity, and generates qualitatively similar
results to those shown.
Our control variable is the average of the logarithm of per capita GDP from 1996 to
2000. Our results do not change if we replace the control by the log of 1990 per capita GDP.
Using the latter avoids possible distortions of GDP figures by the late 1990s economic and
financial crisis in the Asian countries.
Wherever possible, we also substitute closely related variables for our variables to
confirm robustness. For example, using “government spending on education as a percentage of
government expenditure” yields qualitatively identical results to those using “government
spending on education as a percentage of GDP”. Similarly, using “labor participation rates”
instead of unemployment rates result in qualitatively similar predictions.
Finally, we produce residual diagnostics such as Cook’s D and student residual and an
“added-variable (AV)” plot (also referred to as a “partial regression plot”) for each regression to
identify unusual or influential observations. The AV plot essentially lets us plot the residuals
from the dependent variable, given the control, against the residuals from the independent
variable of interest (in this paper the stability indexes), given the control. If any observation
seems influential, we rerun the regression without it and check for changes in the signs and
significance of the regression coefficients. For example, South Africa appears to be an outlier in
the “public health” regressions. However, removing it does not change the results qualitatively.

17

The only place where outliers are evident is in the “sickness and health benefits” regression, and
its results with and without the outliers are discussed in the text accordingly.

Conclusions

We undertook this exercise hoping to find evidence that big business stability might correlate
with laudable social outcomes – liberty, equality, and fraternity in the words of the French
revolutionaries. Such non-economic goals are legitimate policy objectives, and if stability in the
large corporate sector contributed to them in any important way, no matter how indirectly,
policies designed to stabilize that sector might be justifiable even if they impede growth by
slowing the process creative destruction.
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This is a first pass analysis only, and
much more work is needed to conclude that no such contribution exists. But if one does exist, it
must be subtle, or well hidden.

General equilibrium interconnections, more complicated

statistical interactions, or any number of complications might be in play. But our inability to find
clear evidence of big business stability contributing to laudable non-economic policy goals
suggests that we might entertain other reasons politicians might value big business stability.
One possibility is political rent-seeking (Krueger, 1974, 1993). Big businesses might be
well positioned to invest in political favors they can call in when needed7.

If so, big business

stability might well be wholly undesirable condition – inimical to rapid growth and primarily a
result of special interests manipulating the political system. Enhancing the stability of the big
business sector might thus bestow substantial benefits, but on a narrow special interest group –
the insiders of those businesses – not on the economy as a whole.
Another possibility is that policies aimed at saving or stabilizing large established
7

A growing empirical literature documents the first-order importance of rent-seeking relationships between
politicians and the business sector in low-income economies. See e.g. Fisman and Svennson (2000) and
Fisman (2002), as well as developed economies, see e.g. Fisman and Di Tella. (2001).

businesses reflect behavioral finance influencing public policy (Shleifer, 2000).

Kahneman and

Twersky (1979) demonstrate that people are loss averse – a loss of a given magnitude has
negative welfare effects that far outweigh the positive effects of an equal sized gain. This gives
rise to a so-called conservative bias in human behavior. If voters irrationally fear losing a current
set of jobs, even though better ones are likely to come along, politicians intent on winning
elections should represent such concerns in public policy decisions – even if this slows growth.
We wholeheartedly concede the tentative nature of these musings and welcome further
research that might clarify matters. In particular, the role of cognitive biases in explaining
seemingly unjustifiable economic policies merits consideration.

Numbers in parentheses are probability levels for rejecting the null hypothesis of zero correlation coefficients
or regression coefficients. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors are used to calculate p-levels in all
regressions. Sample is the 43 countries listed in Table I.

Table 6. Big Business Stability and the Voice of Labor
The left panel reports correlation coefficients between big business stability and variables
measuring the voice of labor. The right panel presents regressions of the form: labor rights
= β0 + β1 stability + β2 ln(y) + ε. Only coefficient estimates on stability (β1) are shown.
