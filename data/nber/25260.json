    "abstract": "\n\nBeginning in 1712, North Carolina\u2019s assembly emitted its own paper money and maintained some amount of paper money in public circulation for the rest of the colonial period. Yet, data on colonial North Carolina\u2019s paper money regime in the current literature are thin and often erroneous. We correct that here. We forensically reconstruct North Carolina\u2019s paper money regime from original sources\u2014providing yearly quantitative data on printings, net new emissions, redemptions and removals, and amounts remaining in public circulation. These new data provide the basis for future economic, political, and social histories of colonial North Carolina.\n\n",
