The Price of Biodiesel RINs and Economic Fundamentals
Scott H. Irwin, Kristen McCormack, and James H. Stock
NBER Working Paper No. 25341
December 2018
JEL No. C32,Q11,Q42
ABSTRACT
The D4 RIN is the tradable compliance certificate for the biomass-based diesel mandate in the
Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Understanding the price dynamics of the D4 RIN is important
for understanding the RFS because its price sets a ceiling on the ethanol RIN (D6) and because
some observers have suggested that RIN price fluctuations are too large to be explained by
economic theory. We use option pricing theory to develop a model of the D4 RIN in terms of its
economic fundamentals: the spread between the prices of biodiesel and petroleum diesel and the
status of the biodiesel blenders’ tax credit. The resulting D4 fundamental price closely tracks
actual D4 prices. We conclude that RIN price volatility arises because of the design of the RFS
and intrinsic features of the US fuel supply system.

1. Introduction and Summary of Results
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the blending of biofuels into the surface
transportation fuel supply, where the percentage blending rate is determined by an annual
rulemaking by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Refiners and importers of
gasoline and diesel fuel (“obligated parties”) demonstrate compliance with the RFS using the
RIN system. A RIN (Renewable Identification Number) is a unique electronic certificate that is
created (generated) when a gallon of biofuel is produced and is separated from the biofuel when
it is blended with petroleum fuel. Once separated, the RIN can be traded. This enables obligated
parties to purchase RINs, which they can then retire with EPA to demonstrate compliance.
The total market value of RINs retired in 2017 was $14 billion (Irwin and Stock 2018).
Different categories of fuel generate different types of RINs. The two RINs that account for
nearly all the market value are D6 RINs for conventional renewable fuels, which is mainly
comprised of corn starch ethanol, and D4 RINs for biomass-based diesel (BBD). As is evident in
Figure 1, RIN prices are highly volatile. This volatility creates compliance cost risk for obligated
parties and undercuts the effectiveness of the RFS in stimulating investment in biofuels
production and distribution infrastructure. This volatility has raised questions about how RIN
prices are determined in practice and whether speculation and market manipulation could be part
of the reason for RIN price volatility.
This paper examines the extent to which D4 RIN prices are determined by economic
fundamentals. D4 RINs are used to demonstrate compliance with the BBD requirement.
However, they also can be used to demonstrate compliance with the conventional requirement;
that is, a D4 RIN can be used instead of a D6 RIN but not vice versa. Thus, D4 RIN prices
provide a cap on D6 RIN prices. As can be seen in Figure 1, this cap was binding much of the
time from February 2013 to June 2018. We focus on D4 RIN prices because we are able to
observe the key fuel prices that economic theory suggests are the economic fundamentals of RIN
pricing, whereas this is not possible for D6 RINs, as explained in Section 2. Because the D4
price is a binding cap on the D6 price for much of this period, if economic fundamentals explain
D4 prices, then they explain much of the variation in D6 prices as well.

Figure 1. Weekly D4 and D6 RIN prices, January 6, 2011 – October 4, 2018

Notes: Weekly data (Thursday) are from OPIS. Prices are of RINs generated in the current calendar year (currentyear vintage RINs).

A RIN can be retired in the year it is generated (“current-year”) or it can be held and used
to satisfy obligations incurred in the next year. Because it can be retired any time during this
window, the D4 RIN is in effect an American call option. As explained in Section 2, economic
theory indicates that the price of the underlying asset depends on (i) the price spread between
biodiesel and its petroleum substitute, ultra low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), and on (ii) whether or not
the biodiesel blenders’ tax credit is in effect contemporaneously. We propose a simple model for
these two fundamentals—the spread is a random walk, and the biodiesel tax credit follows a
Markov process—which is consistent with their time series properties. Using option pricing
theory, we derive two models for the D4 price. The first allows for the possibility that the
biodiesel-ULSD spread might be negative and yields a closed-form expression for the option
price derived under the additional assumption that the spread process is Gaussian. The second

3

expression does not require normality but assumes that the probability of a negative fundamental
is negligible.
It turns out that the two models yield similar predictions for the D4 price, although the
nonlinear model outperforms the linear model when the spread is low. Figure 2 shows the D4
price and its predicted value based on the nonlinear economic fundamentals model, averaged
across the predictions for the three markets for which we have data on the biodiesel-ULSD
spread (Chicago, the Gulf, and New York Harbor (NYH)). Evidently, the economic
fundamentals do a good job explaining the variation in RIN prices at the monthly frequency and
longer. There are short-term (one or two week) departures from the fundamentals which we take
to represent unmodeled transitory developments in the fuels market, such as weather-related
supply disruptions. There are also some longer departures from fundamentals, such as in the first
half of 2016; however, those departures are relatively small (the average prediction error from
January to June 2016 is $0.13; over all of 2016 it is $0.02).

Figure 2. Weekly D4 RIN price and its predicted value based on the nonlinear economic
fundamentals model, averaged over three markets (Chicago, Gulf, New York Harbor)

Notes: The predicted price from the nonlinear option pricing model is the average of three predicted prices based on
three biodiesel-ULSD spot spreads: Chicago, Gulf, and (starting Oct. 25, 2012), New York Harbor.

This paper contributes to the literature on RIN pricing. The most closely related
contributions are Irwin and Good (2017) and Lade, Lin Lawell, and Smith (2018). Irwin and
Good (2017) price D4 RINs using the contemporaneous economic fundamentals and do not
incorporate the option value or the uncertainty surrounding the biodiesel tax credit. Lade, Lin
Lawell, and Smith (2018) use an option pricing framework to develop a joint model for pricing
multiple RINs including the nesting cap. Relative to their paper, we use a more immediate
measure of fundamentals which we would expect should improve fit (biodiesel prices and
ULSD, whereas they use soybean oil and crude oil prices), we incorporate the biodiesel tax
credit, and, by focusing solely on the D4 RIN, we are able to obtain a closed-form solution for
the option price. There is also a growing literature on the pass-through of RIN prices through the
fuel supply chain (see Knittel, Meiselman and Stock (2017) and Lade and Bushnell
(forthcoming) for references); however, that literature focuses on the consequences of a
movement in RIN prices not on the economic reasons for RIN price variation in the first place.

2. D4 RIN Pricing Model
At current blend ratios, pure petroleum diesel (ULSD) and a blend of biodiesel and
ULSD are effectively perfect substitutes, after adjusting for biodiesel having 92.7% the energy
content of ULSD. Because biodiesel is more expensive than ULSD, it would not enter the market
were it not for subsidies. The two national-level subsidies are through the RFS, in the form of the
D4 RIN, and the biodiesel blenders’ tax credit.
We begin by describing the date-t fundamental value of the D4 RIN, first without the
biodiesel tax credit in place, then with the tax credit in place. Because the biorefiner produces
both the wet biodiesel and the D4 RINs attached to the biodiesel, the value received by the
biorefiner is the sum of the wet fuel value, which is the energy-adjusted ULSD price, and the
price of the D4 RIN. Economic theory suggests that, absent the biodiesel tax credit, the D4 RIN
price will adjust so that the supply of biodiesel equals the demand for biodiesel, where the
demand is determined by the EPA annual RFS rulemaking. Because each gallon of biodiesel
generates 1.5 D4 RINs, absent the tax credit the price based on contemporaneous economic
fundamentals at=
date t is Pt * max ( Pt Biodiesel − 0.927 PtULSD ) / 1.5, 0 ) , where Pt Biodiesel is the biodiesel

5

price, PtULSD is the ULSD price, and 0.927 is the energy content adjustment for biodiesel. 1 The
fundamental price is truncated at zero because the, if the BBD price is less than the energyadjusted ULSD price, the BBD mandate will not be binding so the D4 RIN price be zero.
The biodiesel blenders’ tax credit provides a tax credit of $1 for each gallon of BBD that
is blended with ULSD. Because ULSD and BBD are perfect substitutes (energy-adjusted), under
perfect competition the blenders’ tax credit will accrue to the biorefiner (and thus to the feed
stock producer). Thus, in our base model, the fundamental value of the D4 RIN at date t is
Pt *= max ( Pt Biodiesel − 0.927 PtULSD − Bt ) / 1.5, 0 ) , where Bt = 1 if the biodiesel tax credit is in effect

on date t and Bt = 0 otherwise.
A D4 RIN can be used to demonstrate compliance for an obligation incurred in the year it
is generated or in the year thereafter. 2 Thus, it is an American option with no dividend and
expiration date of December 31 in the year after it was generated. As a result, the D4 RIN can be
priced as a European option, using its fundamental value on the expiration date as the price of the
underlying asset. For a risk-neutral firm 3, this gives the pricing formula in Lade, Lin Lawell, and
Smith (2018, equation (2)),

where St = PTBiodiesel − 0.927 PTULSD , T is December 31 of the year after it was generated, Et denotes
the expectation conditional on information at time t, and the factor of 1/1.5 adjusts for the fact

1

The fundamental price here is expressed for biodiesel, which generates 1.5 RINs per gallon and
for which the main feedstock in the United States is soybean oil. The BBD mandate in the RFS
also can be met using renewable diesel, which is produced by hydrotreatment, is fully compatible
with petroleum diesel, and generates 1.7 RINs per gallon because of its higher energy content. In
equilibrium there would also be a D4 fundamentals equation relating the price of renewable
diesel to ULSD. We focus on conventional biodiesel because its volumes are larger than
renewable diesel, because we have biodiesel prices but not renewable diesel prices, and because
soy biodiesel is generally considered the marginal fuel in the industry.
2
For example, a 2017 obligation can be met using a RIN generated in 2016 or one generated in
2017. Thus, the final date for generating a RIN to meet a 2017 obligation is Dec. 31, 2017.
3
Risk neutrality is not needed to obtain (1). From the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, the
D4 price is Pt D 4 =Et ( mt ,T × max [ ( ST − BT ) /1.5, 0]) , where mt,T is the stochastic discount factor.
Equation (1) follows if the stochastic discount factor is uncorrelated with the fundamental price.
6

that one gallon of biodiesel generates 1.5 RINs. The maximum in (1) imposes the condition that
the price of the D4 RIN cannot be negative.
We complete the model by assuming that ST follows a random walk and that BT follows a
Markov process:

E ( St +τ St , Bt ) = St , τ ≥ 1, and

(2)

Pr ( BT = 1 St , Bt )= E ( BT St , Bt )= pBt + (1 − q )(1 − Bt ) .

(3)

where p and q are the probabilities of staying in states 1 and 0, respectively; that is, p = Pr[BT =
1|Bt = 1] and q = Pr[BT = 0|Bt = 0].
If the biodiesel tax credit is in place, it is in place for a calendar year. Thus Equation (3)
applies to terminal date T in the calendar year subsequent to the current date t. This is the
appropriate timing for evaluating the price of current-year RINs. We examine these assumptions
empirically in the next section and show that they are consistent with the spread and tax credit
data, with the exception that there is some evidence that the level of the spread depends on the
value of the tax credit. We generalize the model to allow for this possibility below, after first
solving (1) – (3).
We provide two closed-form solutions for the D4 RIN price. The first further assumes
that the spread innovations are Gaussian, so that the conditional distribution of ST given St = st
and Bt = bt is N  st , σ 2 (T − t )  , where σ 2 is the variance of ΔSt (we treat this variance as
constant here for simplicity but in the empirical work allow it to vary over time). Under these
assumptions, a calculation yields,

where φ(.) is the normal density and Φ(.) is the cumulative normal distribution. 4
The second solution assumes that the probability of the fundamental price going below
zero is negligible, in which case Et max [ ( ST − BT ) /1.5, 0] ≈ Et ( ST − BT ) /1.5 and
Pt D 4 e − r (T −t ) Et ( ST − BT ) /1.5
=

(6)

= e − r (T −t ) {St − [ pBt − (1 − q )(1 − Bt ) ]} /1.5.

Equation (6) also obtains as a limiting approximation to (4) and (5) for small σ.
It is tempting to try to extend this approach to the D6 RIN, the RIN generated by corn
ethanol. This is not readily done, however, because ethanol is not a direct substitute for gasoline
after energy adjustment. Ethanol has a higher octane value than petroleum gasoline so at blends
less than 10% it is used as an octane booster. At blends greater than 10%, it faces the so-called
D10 blend wall and consumers need an incentive to blend ethanol. Thus, although the ethanol
supply price (the price of bulk ethanol with a RIN) is observed on commodity exchanges, the
ethanol demand price depends on the blend ratio and is not observed. In addition, the nesting
structure of the RFS allows D4 RINs to be used to meet the conventional mandate, further
complicating the analysis. For additional discussion, see Lade, Lin Lawell, and Smith (2018).

3. Data and Empirical Results
We use weekly OPIS data (Thursday) of national average prices for D4 RINs that expire
in the current year and of spot prices for wholesale ULSD and biodiesel at Chicago, the Gulf,

and the New York Harbor. The D4 price data and the Chicago and Gulf fuel price data span
September 3, 2009 – Oct. 4, 2018. The New York Harbor data span Oct. 19, 2012 – Oct. 4, 2018.
The RFS underwent a transition in 2010 with new volumes and regulations. The first year
of the new regime (“RFS2”) in which the required volumes were known in real time was 2011.
We therefore begin our estimation in the first week of January 2011. We use earlier data on the
spread to estimate the variance of the change in the spread, as discussed below. We also
collected data on when the biodiesel tax credit was in effect contemporaneously and, on each
date, when it was set to expire if it was in place contemporaneously. 5 For the interest rate we use
the 6-month Treasury rate.
The spread and the biodiesel tax credit. Table 1 presents statistics describing the
stochastic process followed by the energy-adjusted spread St. Column (1) presents a levels
autoregression and Dickey-Fuller test for a unit root, column (2) presents the same regression
imposing a unit root (i.e. first differences regression), and column (3) examines whether the
coefficients in the first differences regression depend on the status of the biodiesel tax credit. For
all three spreads, the results are consistent with the base model assumption that St follows a
random walk and that its coefficients do not depend on the biodiesel tax credit. 6
Columns (4) and (5) in Table 1 examine the possibility that the level of the spread
depends on whether or not the biodiesel tax credit is in place. The evidence suggests that (a) the
Chicago spread averages $0.74 higher if the $1 tax credit is in effect ($0.77 for the Gulf and
$0.67 for the NYH spread, which are over a shorter sample), and (b) the residual from regression

5

The biodiesel blenders’ tax credit was in place contemporaneously for the full calendar years of
2007-2009, 2011, 2013, and 2016. For calendar years 2010, 2012, 2014-15, and 2017, the tax
credit was restored retroactively. For 2018, the tax credit has expired and, as of this writing, it is
not known whether it will be restored retroactively. Thus, for 2010, 2012, 2014-15, and 2017, the
tax credit was not in place but market participants did not know whether the tax credit would be
restored retroactively or whether it would be reinstituted for the subsequent year; for 2011, 2013,
and 2016, it was in place but was scheduled to expire at the end of the year, and it was unknown
whether it would be extended into the subsequent year.
6
The Dickey-Fuller tests do not reject a unit root for all three spreads. For Chicago and New
York Harbor, lags of the spread beyond the first do not enter the spread regression at the 10%
significance level, consistent with the random walk model. For the Gulf, however, they are
significant at the 5% level. The sum of the coefficients on lagged first differences for the Gulf is
small (0.03), so forecasts including those lags are consistent with random walk forecasts at
horizons beyond a week. Given the long horizon for the forecasts because of the RIN retirement
date we therefore use the random walk approximation for all three spreads.
9

in column (4) follows a random walk. This latter finding is consistent with St following a random
walk with jumps on the dates that the tax credit comes into effect. Figure 3 shows the Chicago
spread and its predicted value from regression (4); this predicted value is a step function that
depends on the status of the tax credit. This variation in the spread related to the BBD tax credit
is large economically as well as statistically (the R2 of regression (4) for Chicago is 0.45);
however, because the spread is integrated of order one and there are only a few times that the tax
credit turns off and on contemporaneously, the coefficient on the tax credit is estimated
imprecisely. 7 Because this dependence of the spread on Bt is perfectly colinear with the included
regressors (1-Bt) and Bt in Equation (6), it does not change the D4 predicted price; however, as
discussed below, it changes the interpretation of the coefficients in the D4 pricing model and has
an interesting substantive interpretation of its own.
It is more difficult to check the assumptions of the biodiesel tax credit Markov model in
equation (3) because of the history of the tax credit. Historically since 2012, the tax credit was on
for at most the current year, never for future years, and it was regularly reinstated retroactively
after it expired. Thus, with the benefit of the full data set, it looks like the probability of the tax
credit being on in the future was always 1 regardless of whether it was currently in effect. In real
time, however, there was always uncertainty as to whether Congress would in fact enact the

The regression in column (4) is St = α + βBBt + ut, where (under the assumptions of the text) ut

of St and Bt, and define δ(τ) = B[τ T ] − B , where [.] is the least greater integer function and B is
the sample mean of Bt. Then the coefficient on Bt in regression (4), βˆ , has the limiting

credit in the next year or restore it retroactively (even though it always did take one of these
actions).
D4 pricing: nonlinear and linear models. For the Chicago and Gulf spreads, the linear
models were estimated over Jan. 6, 2011 – Oct. 4, 2018. For the NYH spread, the linear model
was estimated over the full span of the available data, Oct. 19, 2012 – Oct. 4, 2018. Constructing
the terms f0,t and f1,t in the nonlinear model requires an additional parameter, the variance of ΔSt.
We estimated this variance using a rolling 52-week retrospective window. For the Chicago and
Gulf spreads, we have more than a year of pre-sample data available to estimate the initial
variance, so the model estimation sample is January 6, 2011 – Oct. 4, 2018 and all observations
use the 52-week retrospective rolling variance. For the NYH spread, the first observation for our
12

NYH data is Oct. 19, 2012. To maximize the estimation span for the NYH nonlinear model, we
used a recursive estimator of the variance of ΔSt for the first 52 weeks, and thereafter a 52-week
rolling estimator. This allows us to estimate the NYH nonlinear model over the span Oct. 25,
2012 – May 31, 2018. The remaining two free parameters in the nonlinear model, q and p, are
estimated by OLS estimation of (4).
The full-sample estimates for the nonlinear model are given in columns (1), (3), and (5)
of Table 2 for the Chicago, Gulf, and NYH spreads, respectively, and the average of the
predicted values from these regressions is shown in Figure 2 (from Jan. 6, 2011 to Oct. 18, 2012,
the average is of the Chicago and Gulf predicted values, thereafter all three predicted values are
averaged). Taken literally, the estimated values of q for the Gulf spread indicate that, if the tax
credit is not in effect, the market believes there is approximately a 18% chance that it will be in
effect at the RIN expiration date next year. If the tax credit is currently in effect, the estimated
value of p indicates that the markets believe there is a 70% chance that it will be in effect next
year. The estimates of p and q from the Chicago and NYH spreads are within a standard error of
the estimates for the Gulf.

Columns (2), (4), and (6) of Table 2 report estimates of the linearized model in Equation
(6). The estimated probabilities of the tax credit being in effect in the next year are somewhat
smaller for the linear model than for the nonlinear model. Notably, the fit of the nonlinear model
is slightly better than that of the linear model.
13

The models discussed so far use the full sample of RIN prices to estimate the transition
probabilities q and p, so the resulting prices would not have been available in real time. To
provide real-time prices, we therefore estimated the nonlinear model over a rolling 104-week
window, estimated over t-105,…, t-1; substituting the resulting rolling estimates of q and p along
with the values of Bt and St at date t into Equation (4) yields a real-time price (recall that the
volatility is estimated over a 52-week retrospective window ending in t-1). Because all our data
are unrevised asset price data available in real time, the rolling predicted prices therefore are
feasible real-time prices. We refer to this model as the real-time nonlinear model.
Figure 4 presents the D4 price and the average predicted value from (a) the nonlinear
models in Table 2, (b) the linear models in Table 2, and (c) the real-time rolling nonlinear
models. There are three salient features of this chart.

First, at the monthly frequency, the models generally track each other closely.
Second, the full-sample nonlinear and linear models tend to differ the most when the RIN
price is low. This corresponds to dates at which the term St – Bt is close to zero, so that the
probability of hitting zero is non-negligible and the nonlinear terms – that is, the option value
component – come into play. In these cases, the nonlinear terms improve the fit (see the episodes
in early and late 2014). In contrast, when St – Bt is far from zero, the predicted values for the
linear and nonlinear models are quite close.
Third, the only time that the real-time nonlinear model has different prices than the fullsample nonlinear model for an extended period is the first half of 2017, where the fit of the fullsample model is better. The first half of 2017 was a period of evolving expectations during the
early months of the Trump Administration, so one interpretation of this discrepancy is that
probabilities estimated using data from the final two years of the Obama administration appear to
be inappropriate descriptions of the actual market probabilities of reinstatement of the tax credit
during this period.
Finally, Figure 5 plots the real-time predicted values from the nonlinear rolling models
for the three spreads separately. Evidently there are high frequency differences among the
predicted values, presumably due to transient local supply or demand conditions. At medium and
low frequencies, however, the predicted values are essentially the same for all three spreads.

4. Extension to the Spread Depending on the Tax Credit
The model laid out in Section 2 assumes that the status of the biodiesel tax credit does not
affect the spread. However, the estimates in the final column of Table 1 provide some weak
evidence that the level of the spread depends on whether the tax credit is in effect. In this section,
we provide two possible explanations for this dependence and then extend the model in Section 2
to allow for the level of the spread to depend on whether or not the tax credit is in place.
One plausible explanation for this dependence is a “race” by diesel blenders to take
advantage of the $1 per gallon blenders’ tax credit that expired at the end of 2011, 2013, and
2016 (Irwin 2017). If blenders perceive that there is a substantial probability that the expiring
credit will be not be renewed, then, in the face of a binding and continuing RFS biodiesel
mandate, it is rational for blenders to take advantage of the tax credit while it is still in place and
thus to purchase biodiesel at a discount in the current year in excess of this year’s mandate.
16

Because excess D4 RINs detached in this way can be used to meet next year’s mandate, and
because any blending limit on BBD is not binding during this period (no so-called “blend wall”),
this increase in blenders’ demand will bid up the price of biodiesel in the current year. If blenders
were confident that the tax credit would not be renewed, blenders would bid up the price by as
much as $1 over what would otherwise prevail; if they were uncertain, they would still have the
incentive to bid up the price by $1 times the probability that it would not be renewed.
The impact of the expiring biodiesel tax credit on biodiesel prices is readily seen with the
aid of Figure 6, which plots the biodiesel price versus a simple breakeven relationship between
the biodiesel price and the price of the marginal feedstock during this period, soybean oil. This
simple model posits that the breakeven price for a representative Iowa biodiesel producer is

0.6 + 7.55Pt SoyOil , where 7.55 is the number of pounds of soybean oil assumed to produce a gallon
of biodiesel, Pt SoyOil is the Iowa price of soybean oil (OPIS), and the intercept captures the nonoil variable costs of the plant, estimated to be $0.60 per gallon. This simple breakeven price
tracks the biodiesel price very closely outside of the spikes in 2011, 2013 and 2016, the three
years in which the tax credit was in place but was slated to expire. Note that the spike in
biodiesel prices relative to costs builds within each of the three years, consistent with increasing
pressure by blenders to take advantage of a tax credit that might not be reinstated. If the
reinstatement of the tax credit at the beginning of 2011, 2013, and 2016 drove biodiesel prices
upward, we should observe a large spike in biodiesel prices relative to costs early in the calendar
year, but we do not.

A second possible explanation for the dependence of the spread on the tax credit is that
the EPA takes the presence of the biodiesel tax credit into account in its annual rulemakings that
sets the renewable volume obligations and percentage standards, and indeed the EPA has at
times explicitly taken the tax credit into account in its rulemakings. 8 If the EPA treats the tax

8

For example, in the 2013 rulemaking, EPA discusses public comments on whether the tax
credit should be taken into account in its rulemakings:
Recently, the tax credit for biodiesel was reinstated after having expired at the end of
2011. This tax credit, applicable retroactively to 2012 and through the end of 2013, may
provide additional incentive to produce and consume biodiesel volumes in excess of the
1.28 bill gal requirement. While one party commented that the biodiesel tax credit should
not be a relevant factor, the existence of a tax credit affects the likelihood that biodiesel
volumes in excess of 1.28 bill gal will be produced. Therefore, it is a relevant
consideration in determining whether there are likely to be sufficient volumes of
advanced biofuel available to meet the statutory volume requirement of 2.75 bill gal. (78

credit as effectively shifting out available supply when setting the percentage standard, then
some or all of the tax credit accrues to biorefiners and to feed stock producers, such as soybean
farmers.
These two explanations – blenders bidding up the price of biodiesel in advance of the tax
credit expiration and EPA taking the tax credit status into account – are not mutually exclusive,
and there is evidence that, in fact, both channels were operating. We therefore extend our model
to allow for the biodiesel tax credit to have an effect on the BBD price and thus on the spread.
Specifically, consistent with regressions (4) and (5) in Table 1, write the spread as,
St =
µ + β Bt + ut , where ut =
ut −1 + ε t ,

(7)

where εt is serially uncorrelated. Because a fraction, β, of the tax credit accrues to biorefiners in
the form of higher BBD price, only a fraction, 1-β, remains to offset the price of the D4 RIN.
Accordingly, the D4 RIN fundamental price is given by,

=
Pt D 4 e − r (T −t ) Et max [ ST − (1 − β ) BT , 0] /1.5 ,

(8)

where St follows (7) and Bt continues to follow the Markov process (3).
Although the economics of the pricing formula (8) are quite different from our base
model, it turns out that the pricing formula and predicted prices are identical in the linear model
and are nearly identical in the nonlinear model. We show this in the linear case, in which the
probability of a negative fundamental is assumed to be zero. Then,
=
Pt D 4 e − r (T −t ) [ Et ST − (1 − β ) Et BT ] /1.5

= e − r (T −t ) {St − (1 − 2 β )(1 − q )(1 − Bt ) − [ (1 − β ) p + β ] Bt } /1.5,

(9)

where the second line of (9) follows by substituting (3), Et ST =
µ + β Et BT + ut and (7) into the
first line of (9) and simplifying.
The key observation is that the terms in brackets in the second line of (9) are the same as
in the baseline linear model (6), except that the coefficients have a different interpretation.
19

Because the terms are the same, the predicted prices are the same in the linear model. In the
nonlinear model, the predicted price depends on the value of β; however, the fact that the
nonlinear and linear models produce very similar predicted prices indicates that in practice this
dependence is very weak so the alternative nonlinear model based on (8) will differ negligibly
from the base nonlinear model.
When the estimate of β from Table 1 is used, along with the expressions for the
coefficients in (9), one obtains different estimates of q and p than in the base model. For
example, estimated over the full sample using the Chicago data, the resulting estimates are q̂ =
1.19 and p̂ = 0.28. The estimated value of q exceeds one which is not sensible; in any event,
both these estimates suggest substantially lower market assessments of whether the tax credit is
in effect in the coming year.
We stress that while β is identified from (7), in practice it is very imprecisely estimated:
formally, because it compares regime means of random walks, informally, because the tax credit
only shifted a few times in our sample so there are few “experiments” with which to estimate β.
Indeed, a 95% confidence interval for β includes both 0 and 1 for each of the three spreads,
respectively corresponding to the cases that none and all of the tax credit accrues to the biodiesel
producer. In the (non-rejected) case that all of the tax credit accrues to the biodiesel producer, the
Markov probability p is not identified (p drops out if β = 1 in (9)). Thus, p is weakly identified in
this application.

5. Discussion and Conclusions
The most important conclusion from this work, shown in Figures 2, 4, and 5, is that
movements in the D4 RIN price at frequencies of a month or longer are well explained by two
economic fundamentals: the spread between the biodiesel and ULSD prices and whether the
biodiesel tax credit is in effect. To explain RIN price volatility, one does not need to resort to
market irrationality or market manipulation; rather, one need look no further than the supply and
demand for biodiesel, the setting of statutory volumes in the RFS, and the history of Congress
intermittently extending, or not, the biodiesel tax credit.
We have laid out three economic channels whereby the tax credit affects RIN prices: an
expectational channel in which the tax credit does not affect the spread, but affects the D4 price
by reducing the subsidy that the D4 RIN would otherwise provide; an expectational channel in
20

which the imminent expiration of the tax credit induces buying BBD before the deadline and
thus increases the spread; and a regulatory channel in which the EPA sets the BBD mandate
based on whether the tax credit is likely to be in effect. All three channels provide predicted D4
prices that are identical in the linear model and are nearly so in the nonlinear model, however the
parameters have different interpretations under the first channel alone than if the second two are
operational. Unfortunately, the relevant parameters differentiating these models are weakly
identified because of the persistence of the spread and the infrequency with which the tax credit
regime changes. We provided evidence, both econometric and institutional, that all three of these
channels are in operation; however, sorting out their relative contributions is left to further
research.
