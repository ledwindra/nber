    "abstract": "\n\nHistory suggests that dismal prophecies regarding the impact of great technological advances rarely come to pass. Yet, as many occupations will indeed vanish with the advent of AI as the new General Purpose Technology (GPT), we should search for ways to ameliorate the detrimental effects of AI, and enhance its positive ones, particularly in: (1) education and skills development: revamp the centuries-old \u201cfactory model\u201d of education, and develop instead skills relevant for an AI-based economy \u2013 analytical, creative, interpersonal, and emotional. (2) The professionalization of personal care occupations, particularly in healthcare and education; these are to provide the bulk of future employment growth, yet as performed today involve little training and technology, and confer low wages. New, higher standards and academic requirements could be set for these occupations, which would enable AI to benefit both providers and users. (3) Affect the direction of technical advance \u2013 we distinguish between \u201chuman-enhancing innovations\u201d (HEI), that magnify and enhance sensory, motoric, and other such human capabilities, and \u201chuman-replacing innovations\u201d (HRI), which replace human intervention, and often leave for humans mostly \u201cdumb\u201d jobs. AI-based HEI\u2019s have the potential to unleash a new wave of creativity and productivity, particularly in services, whereas HRI\u2019s might just decrease employment and give rise to unworthy jobs.\n\n",
