We see globalization as a process that induces countries to embrace greater trade and financial integration. This in turn should shift their tax revenue from \"easy to collect\" taxes (tariffs and seigniorage) towards \"hard to collect\" taxes (value added and income taxes). We find that trade and financial openness have a positive association with the \"hard to collect\" taxes, and a negative association with the \"easy to collect\" taxes.\n\n",
