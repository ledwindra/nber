ABSTRACT
We study on-the-job learning among classroom teachers, especially learning skills from coworkers.
Using data from a new field experiment, we document meaningful improvements in teacher job performance
when high- and low-performing teachers working at the same school are paired and asked to work
together on improving the low-performer’s skills. In particular, pairs are asked to focus on specific
skills identified in the low-performer’s prior performance evaluations. In the classrooms of low-performing
teachers treated by the intervention, students scored 0.12 standard deviations higher than students in
control classrooms. These improvements in teacher performance persisted, and perhaps grew, in the
year after treatment. Empirical tests suggest the improvements are likely the result of low-performing
teachers learning skills from their partner.

“Some types of knowledge can be mastered better if simultaneously
related to a practical problem.” Gary Becker (1962)
Can employees learn job skills from their coworkers? Whether and how peers contribute
to on-the-job learning, and at what costs, are practical questions for personnel management.
Economists’ interest in these questions dates to at least Alfred Marshall (1890) and, more
recently, Gary Becker (1962) and Robert Lucas (1988). Yet, despite the intuitive role for
coworkers in human capital development, empirical evidence of learning from coworkers is
scarce. 2 In this paper we present new evidence from a random-assignment field experiment in
U.S. public schools: low-performing classroom teachers in treatment schools were each matched
to a high-performing colleague in their school, and pairs were encouraged to work together on
improving their teaching skills. We report positive treatment effects on teacher productivity, as
measured by contributions to student achievement growth, particularly for low-performing
teachers. We then test empirical predictions consistent with peer learning and other potential
mechanisms.
While there is limited evidence on learning from coworkers specifically, there is a
growing literature on productivity spillovers among coworkers generally. Morreti (2004) and
Battu, Belfield, and Sloane (2003) document human capital spillovers broadly, using variation
between firms, but without insight to mechanisms. Several other papers, each focusing on a
specific firm or occupation as we do, also find spillovers; the apparent mechanisms are shared
production opportunities or peer influence on effort (Ichino and Maggi 2000, Hamilton,
Nickerson and Owan 2003, Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul 2005, Mas and Moretti 2009,
Azoulay, Graff Zivin, and Wang 2010). Moreover, these spillovers may be substantial. Lucas

We are focused in this paper on coworker peers and learning on-the-job. A large literature examines the role of
peers in classroom learning and other formal education settings (for a review see Sacerdote 2010).

1

(1988) suggests human capital spillovers, broadly speaking, could explain between-country
differences in income.
One empirical example of learning from coworkers comes from the study of classroom
teachers. Jackson and Bruegmann (2009) find a teacher’s productivity, as measured by
contribution to her students’ test score growth, improves when a new higher-performing
colleague arrives at her school; then, consistent with peer learning, the improvements persist
after she is no longer working with the same colleague (i.e., teaching the same grade in the same
school). The authors estimate that prior coworker effectiveness explains about one-fifth of the
variation in teacher performance.
In this paper we also focus on classroom teachers. While we believe the paper makes an
important general contribution, a better understanding of on-the-job learning among teachers
specifically has sizable potential value for students and economies. Classroom teaching
represents a substantial investment of resources: one out of ten college-educated workers in the
U.S. is a public school teacher, and public schools spend $285 billion annually on teacher wages
and benefits (U.S. Census Bureau 2015, Table 6). 3 And there is substantial variability in teacher
job performance: measured both in the short-run with students’ test scores (see Jackson, Rockoff,
and Staiger 2014 for a review) and the long-run with students’ economic and social success years
later as adults (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2014). One seemingly consistent source of
differences in teacher performance is experience on the job (Rockoff 2004, Harris and Sass 2011,
Papay and Kraft 2015). Estimated differences due to experience are much larger than differences
in formal pre-service or in-service training (Jackson, Rockoff, and Staiger 2014).

We report here on a field experiment in Tennessee designed to study on-the-job, peer
learning between teachers who work at the same school. Schools were randomly assigned to
either treatment or a business-as-usual control. In treatment schools, low-performing teachers
were each matched to a high-performing partner using detailed micro-data from prior
performance evaluations. In Tennessee, teachers are observed in the classroom multiple times
per year and scored in 19 specific skills (e.g., “questioning,” “lesson structure and pacing,”
“managing student behavior”). Each low-performing “target” teacher was identified as such
because his prior evaluation scores were particularly low in one or more of the 19 skill areas.
Then his high-performing “partner” was chosen because she had high scores in (many of) the
same skill areas. Each pair of teachers was encouraged by their principal to work together during
the school year on improving teaching skills identified by evaluation data. Thus the topics and
skills teachers worked on were specific to each pair and varied between pairs. More generally,
pairs were encouraged to examine each other’s evaluation results, observe each other teaching in
the classroom, discuss strategies for improvement, and follow-up with each other’s commitments
throughout the school year. 4
We find that treatment—pairing classroom teachers to work together on improving
skills—improves teachers’ job performance, as measured by their students’ test score growth. At
the end of the school year, the average student in a treatment school scores 0.06σ (student
standard deviations) higher on standardized math and reading/language arts tests than she would
have in a control school, regardless of whether her teacher participated in a partnership. The
gains are concentrated among “target” teachers; in target teachers’ classrooms students score
0.12σ higher. These are meaningful gains. One standard deviation in teacher performance is

Department of Education. TNDOE also played key roles in carrying out the experiment and collecting data.

typically estimated to be 0.15-0.20σ (Hanushek and Rivkin 2010). In other words, a gain of
0.12σ is roughly equivalent to the difference between being assigned to a median teacher instead
of a bottom quartile teacher. These improvements in teacher performance persist, and perhaps
grow, in the school year following treatment; in year two the effect for target teachers is a
marginally significant 0.25σ.
Interpreting these differences as causal effects of treatment rests mainly on the random
assignment of schools. While the “target” and “partner” roles were not randomly assigned, the
roles were assigned by algorithm for both treatment and control schools prior to randomization,
as we detail in Section 1. The estimates in the previous paragraph are intent-to-treat estimates
based on algorithm-assigned roles.
After documenting average treatment effects, we turn to examining mechanisms. In
particular we ask: Can the performance improvements be attributed to growth in teachers’ skills
from peer learning, or are other changes in behavior or effort behind the estimated effects?
Larger effects for target teachers, effects which persist over time, are highly suggestive of skill
growth, but could also result if partnering increased target teachers’ motivation or effort, or
provided new opportunities to share resources or tasks (Jackson and Bruegmann 2009). In
Section 3, we test a number of empirical predictions motivated by these potential mechanisms. If
the underlying mechanism is skill growth, we would predict larger treatment effects for target
teachers when the high-performing partner’s skill strengths match more of the target teacher’s
weak areas. We would also predict larger improvements in classroom observation scores for the
skills matched, but smaller or no improvements in the skills left unmatched. Both predictions are
true empirically. If, however, the mechanism is shared production or resources, we would predict
larger effects when teacher pairs teach similar grade-levels or subjects. If the mechanism is effort

4

or motivation, we would predict larger effects when there were larger gaps in prior performance
between paired teachers, on the assumption that the comparison of performance induces greater
effort (as in Mas and Moretti 2009). Neither of these latter predictions is borne out in the data. In
short, the available data suggest target teachers learned new skills from their partner.
One contextual feature of the experiment is also important to interpreting these results.
The detailed micro-data with which teachers were paired are taken from the state’s performance
evaluation system for public school teachers, which the Tennessee Department of Education
introduced in 2011. Locally the treatment was known as the “Evaluation Partnership Program.”
These connections to formal evaluation, and its stakes, likely influenced principals’ and teachers’
willingness to participate and the nature of their participation. 5 The evaluation context also
affects the counterfactual behavior of control schools and teachers. This context may partly
explain why we find positive effects in this case while other research dose not consistently find
effects of formal mentoring or formal on-the-job training for teachers (see reviews by Jackson,
Rockoff, and Staiger 2014, and Yoon et al. 2007). 6 More generally, this paper also belongs to a
small literature on how evaluation programs affect teacher performance (Taylor and Tyler 2012,
Steinberg and Sartain 2015, Bergman and Hill 2015, Dee and Wyckoff 2015). Taylor and Tyler
(2012) study veteran teachers who were evaluated by and received feedback from experienced,
high-performing teachers; the resulting improvements in teacher productivity persisted for years
after the peer evaluation ended.
The performance improvements documented in this paper suggest teachers can learn job
skills from their colleagues—empirical evidence of the intuitive benefit of skilled coworkers in
5

In one-on-one interviews, some participating teachers said they were willing to participate because teacher pairs
were matched based on specific skills and not on a holistic measure of performance.

Exceptions include an example of mentoring studied by Rockoff (2008) and an example of training studied by
Angrist and Lavy (2001).

human capital development. The magnitude of those improvements suggests peer learning may
be as important as on-the-job experience in teacher skill development (Rockoff 2004, Papay and
Kraft forthcoming); indeed, peer learning may be a key contributor to the oft-cited estimates of
returns to experience in teaching. Most practically, the treatment and results suggest promising
ideas for managing the sizable teacher workforce.
Next, in Section 1, we describe the treatment in detail, along with other features of the
experimental setting and data. In Section 2 we describe the average treatment effects and
treatment effects by teachers’ assigned partnership role. Section 3 discusses potential
mechanisms and presents tests of empirical predictions related to those mechanisms. We
conclude in Section 4 with some further discussion of the results.

1. Treatment, Setting, and Data
1.1 Treatment
We report on a field experiment designed to study on-the-job, peer learning between
teachers who work at the same school. At schools randomly assigned to the treatment
condition—known in the schools as the “Evaluation Partnership Program”—low-performing
“target” teachers were paired with a high-performing “partner” teacher, and each pair was
encouraged to work together on improving each other’s teaching skills over the course of the
school year. Importantly, teachers were matched using micro-data from state-mandated
performance evaluations. As described further in the next section, these prior evaluations include
separate performance ratings for many specific instructional skills (e.g., “questioning,” “lesson
structure and pacing,” “managing student behavior”). Each target teacher was identified as such
because he had low scores in one or more specific skill areas; his matched partner was selected

6

because she had high scores in (many of) the same skill areas. Pairs were approached by their
school principal and asked to work together for the year focusing on the strength-matched-toweakness skill areas, with the goal of improving instructional skills. Thus the topics and skills
teachers worked on were specific to each pair and varied between pairs. More generally, pairs
were encouraged to scrutinize each other’s evaluation results, observe each other teaching in the
classroom, discuss strategies for improvement, and follow-up with each other’s commitments
throughout the school year.
While individual teacher pairings were the focus of the intervention, treatment was
assigned at the school level. Thus the success of individual pairs may have been influenced by
the principal’s role or support, or influenced by other teacher pairs in the school working in the
same kinds of ways. Certainly the extensive margin of treatment take-up was in the hands of the
school principal, as described below.
1.1.1 Teacher Evaluation in Tennessee
All public school teachers in Tennessee are evaluated annually. Beginning in the 2011-12
school year, the state introduced new, more-intensive requirements for teacher evaluation. The
new evaluations include both (i) direct assessments of teaching skills in classroom observations,
and (ii) measures of teachers’ contributions to student achievement. We focus in this section on
the classroom observation scores because they are the micro-data used in matching target and
partner pairs, and the motivation for each pair’s work together.
Each teacher is observed while teaching and scored multiple times during the course of
the school year, typically by the school principal or vice-principal. Observations and scores are
structured around a rubric known as the “TEAM rubric” which measures 19 different
instructional skill areas or “indicators” which are grouped into three categories: instruction,

7

planning, and classroom environment. 7 The rubric is based in part of the work of Charlotte
Danielson (1996). Skill areas include things like “managing student behavior,” “instructional
plans,” “teacher content knowledge,” and many others. As an example, Figure 1 reproduces the
rubric for “Questioning.” Teachers are scored from 1-5 on each skill area: 1 significantly below
expectations, 2 below expectations, 3 at expectations, 4 above expectations, 5 significantly above
expectations. As the Figure 1 example suggests, the rubric language describes relatively specific
skills and behaviors, not vague general assessments of teaching effectiveness. As described in
the next section, we use these micro-data on 19 different skill areas to match high- and lowperforming teachers in working pairs.
Table 1 lists all 19 skills and provides summary statistics for teachers’ scores in the year
prior to the experiment. Teachers score lowest in “problem solving” and highest in “content
knowledge.” Scores for classroom environment skills are most variable, especially “managing
student behavior.” Table 1 draws on teachers in the treatment and control schools, but these
statistics are similar when calculated using all Tennessee schools.
At the end of the school year, the classroom observation micro-data are aggregated to
produce a final, overall, univariate observation evaluation for each teacher. In the 2012-13 school
year, the second under the state’s new requirements, teachers in our sample scored quite high in
classroom observations: more than four-fifths received an overall average rating of 3 or higher
(Table 1 Column 3), while just 1.2 percent scored 2 or lower. 8 Critically for this study, however,
there was substantial variation between and within teachers at the 19-skill micro-data level as
7

TEAM stands for Tennessee Educator Acceleration Model. Most Tennessee districts, including the district where
this paper’s data were collected, use the TEAM rubric. Some districts use alternative rubrics. The full TEAM rubric
is available at: http://team-tn.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TEAM-General-Educator-Rubric.pdf.

The small percentage of “low” final overall scores is not a-typical, even after the revisions in teacher evaluation
programs in recent years (Wiesberg 2009, New York Times, March 30, 2013)

detailed in Table 1. Two out of five teachers received a score lower than 3 in at least one of the
19 skill areas; and, among that 41 percent, the average number of skills with a score below 3 is
5.8. (The threshold of below 3 was used to identify skills for matching pairs, as described in the
next section.) In the state evaluation process, the overall observation rating is combined with
student achievement data to produce a summative score for each teacher. It is important to note
that, while certainly used in the state’s formal evaluation scores, student achievement data were
not used in the matching of teachers or communication with teachers about the goals of the
teacher partnerships.
1.1.2 Identifying and Matching High- and Low-Performing Teachers
For the purposes of this experiment, a teacher was identified as a “low-performing” or
“target” if he had a score less than 3 in one or more of the 19 skill areas. Similarly, a teacher was
identified as a “high-performing” potential “partner” if she had a score of 4 or higher in one or
more skill area. Both the set of target and the set of potential partners were identified based on
pre-experiment evaluation scores: the average of a teacher’s scores from the prior school year
2012-13 and, when available, the first observation of 2013-14. 9
Our matching algorithm followed these steps and rules: (1) Consider each possible
pairing of a target and a partner teacher who work in the same school, and calculate the total
number of skill areas (out of 19 possible) where there is a strength-to-weakness skill match for
that pairing. A strength-to-weakness match occurs when the target teacher has a score less than 3
9

If a teacher was identified as both a “target” and “partner” by these rules, the teacher was included only on the
target list. Additionally, any potential “target” teacher with an overall observation rating of “above expectation” (4)
or “significantly above expectations” (5) was excluded from the target teacher list.
Two schools had few or no teachers identified as “target” by these rules. In those two cases, after random
assignment, we used a threshold of less than or equal to 3, instead of strictly less than 3. One school had many
teachers identified as “target.” In that school we limited the set of target teachers to those with 8 or more skill areas
(out of 19) with a score less than 3. While these adjustments aided in the practical implementation of the program,
our ITT estimates use only the original assignments of teachers, not the assignments after these school-specific
adjustments.

9

in a given skill, and the partner has a score of 4 or higher in the same skill. (2) For each school,
list all possible configurations of pairings where each potential partner is matched to just one
target teacher. (3) Choose the set of pairings which maximizes the number of strength-toweakness matches (out of 19 * T possible, where T is the number of target teachers). 10 This
algorithm produced a set of “recommended” matches for each school. We created recommended
match lists for both treatment and control schools pre-experiment, but the lists were only
provided to principals in the treatment schools. 11
The principal in each treatment school was responsible for introducing each targetpartner pair, explaining why the two had been paired, and encouraging the pair in their work
together. Each teacher, target or partner, ultimately decided to what extent she would participate
and, in that sense, the experiment can be thought of as an encouragement-style design.
Additionally, principals were encouraged to review the recommended list of matches and make
changes as they saw fit. This latitude for principals was intended to help improve matches using
local knowledge not observed in the evaluation data; for example, a recommended match may
have paired two individuals known to not work well together. To encourage data-informed
adjustments, we provided principals with a list of additional potential matches for each target
teacher. These additional matches were the five potential partners with the highest strength-toweakness scores from step (1) above, regardless of the optimization and constraints in steps (2)
and (3). Principals received a spreadsheet listing the 19 skill areas for each teacher to show
where target and potential partner teachers matched. An example is shown in Figure 2. We
10

The core of this matching approach is sometimes called the Hungarian Algorithm or Method.
We can say definitively that no control school received a list of target teachers and proposed partners. However,
we discussed the idea of the program with all principals, and we cannot ensure that the kernel of the idea was not
adopted by principals in the control schools. Because principals conduct the observations, they had on hand all of
the information necessary to conduct such pairings. Our discussions with district officials, though, suggest that
principals in control schools did not undertake such a program. Any such activities would bias downward our
estimated average treatment effects.

provided the proposed matches and information for participating principals and teachers to
principals in early November 2013. 12
1.2 Sample and Random Assignment
The experiment was conducted at 14 elementary and middle schools (7 treatment, 7
control) in a medium-sized district in Tennessee. The district, Jackson-Madison County School
System, is the 12th largest in the state enrolling approximately 13,000 students. Across the
district, 77 percent of students are economically disadvantaged, 61 percent are AfricanAmerican, 32 percent are white, and 7 percent are Hispanic. The district spends about $9,750 per
pupil annually. In 2013-14, the state of Tennessee’s measure of student test score growth ranked
Jackson-Madison as a Level 1 district, the lowest-performing category in the state.
In the summer of 2013, principals from all 21 of the district’s elementary and middle
schools were briefed on the Evaluation Partnership Program and 14 agreed to participate in the
study. We blocked the 14 schools in seven pairs based on level (elementary or middle) and
student enrollment, and randomly assigned one to treatment within each pair. 13
During the experiment year 2013-14, the 14 schools enrolled nearly 3,000 students in
grades 4 through 8 with at least 136 teachers in mathematics and reading/language arts. We focus
on grades 4 through 8 because these are the grades where we observe pre- and post-experiment
student achievement measured by state tests. Descriptive information on the students and
teachers is provided in Table 2.

12

Participating principals and teachers mainly communicated directly with the research team. The exception is that
lists of proposed matches were emailed to principals by the TNDOE. The research team prepared the match reports
using de-identified data, where teachers were only known by randomly generated ID numbers. The TNDOE then
replaced the random IDs with actual names and sent the reports to principals.
13
This paper focuses on elementary and middle schools where we have data on student achievement test scores. We
also recruited the district’s high schools and pre-kindergarten schools. Two high schools and one pre-k school
agreed to participate, were randomized, and participated in the program.

11

Interpreting the results of this experiment as causal effects rests largely on the success of
randomly assigning schools to treatment and control conditions. Table 2 reports the traditional
test of randomization, comparing pre-treatment characteristics of students, teachers, and teacher
pairs. These tests include fixed effects for the randomization block pairs. We read the results as
evidence of successful randomization. Most differences are substantively quite small. 14 Only 2 of
the 20 characteristics show a statistically significant difference between treatment and control
means: the proportion of English language learner students, and the difference in baseline
observation scores for teacher pairs. Additionally, in Appendix Table A1, we check for covariate
balance separately for teachers in each assigned program role: low-performing target teachers,
high-performing partners, and teachers not assigned a role. The results are similar.
1.3 Data
The Tennessee Department of Education provided two primary sources of data for this
paper. First, we use the teacher evaluation micro-data described above for the years 2012-13
through 2014-15. The pre-randomization evaluation data are used in matching target and partner
teachers; the post-randomization evaluation data are used as outcome measures of observed
teacher job performance. Second, we use state administrative records for the years 2012-13
through 2014-15 that include (i) student scores from annual state standardized tests in math and
reading/language-arts in grades 3 through 8, (ii) information on student demographics and
special educational programs, (iii) records linking each student to her assigned teacher(s) for
each subject each year, (iv) and information about teacher experience and prior performance. We
standardize all test scores (mean zero, standard deviation one) within year-grade-subject cells

14

Note that the teacher value-added scores are in teacher standard deviation units, not student standard deviations as
is often the case. In student standard deviations the differences are roughly one-tenth to one-fifth the magnitudes in
Tables 2 and A1.

12

using the statewide distribution (as opposed to the district specific mean and standard deviation).
Additionally, TDOE provided data on where each teacher was working at the beginning of the
2015-16 school year.

2. Effects on Student Achievement
In this paper, we ask two primary empirical questions: First, did the treatment—pairing
classroom teachers to work together on improving skills—benefit (harm) teacher performance?
Second, if there were improvements, is there evidence that those improvements are the result of
growth in teachers’ skills from peer learning?
Our primary measure of teacher performance is growth in student achievement test
scores. Student learning that is measurable in standardized tests is, to be certain, only one aspect
of a teacher’s job responsibilities. Nevertheless, existing empirical evidence suggests student test
scores capture important variation in teacher performance (Jackson, Staiger, and Rockoff 2014
provide a review of the literature).
2.1 Average Treatment Effects on Student Achievement
Our most straightforward treatment effect estimates simply compare mean test scores in
treatment and control schools. The treatment-control difference in means, 𝛿, is estimated by

fitting the regression specification

𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 = 𝛿𝐸𝑃𝑃𝑠(𝑗) + 𝑋𝑖 𝛽 + 𝜋𝑏(𝑠) + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡

13

(1)

where 𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 is the end-of-year 𝑡 (the experiment year) test score in subject 𝑘 (math or reading)

for student 𝑖 assigned to teacher 𝑗 in school 𝑠. 15 The treatment indicator, 𝐸𝑃𝑃𝑠(𝑗) , varies only at

the school-level 𝑠. All estimates in the paper include randomization block fixed effects, 𝜋𝑏(𝑠) .
Throughout the paper, all statistical inferences account for error clustering within

schools. We report p-values obtained by the wild cluster bootstrap-t method suggested by
Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008). This approach provides asymptotic refinement when the
number of clusters is small, as in our setting with 14 clusters. Cameron and coauthors show that
rejection rates can be as high as 10 percent for a nominally 𝛼 = 0.05 test using conventional

clustering methods; using the wild cluster bootstrap-t method rejection rates approach 5 percent.
However, in this setting inference using conventional cluster-robust standard errors (as
implemented in Stata) turns out to be quite similar. 16
We report 𝛿̂ without and with additional covariates 𝑋𝑖 , which are included to improve

precision. The additional covariates include student 𝑖’s prior achievement—measured with the

average of student 𝑖’s math and reading scores from the prior school year (𝑡 − 1)—as well as her
gender, race/ethnicity, English language learner status, and special education status. 17 The vector
𝑋𝑖 also includes a pre-experiment “value added” measure of teacher 𝑗’s contributions to student
test scores in subject 𝑘; this measure comes from that state’s TVAAS system for 2011-12 and

15

The student-teacher link records allow students to be linked to more than one teacher for a given subject, though
three-quarters in our sample are linked to just one teacher. When a student has more than one teacher, the state
assigns a “percent responsibility” to each teacher. When a student has two or more teachers, we include one
observation for each student-by-teacher pairing and weight by the “percent responsibility.” But our results are robust
to assigning students to the one teacher with the highest weight.
16
Errors may also be correlated within a group of students taught by the same teacher. In our setting teachers are
nested within schools. Thus, clustering errors at the school level is equivalent to clustering at both the school and
teacher levels simultaneously (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2011).
17
While the field experiment occurred only in one district, we observe student test scores throughout the state. As a
result we have very little missing data in 𝑋𝑖 , for example, less than 4 percent of students are missing baseline
achievement. When baseline achievement or another given covariate is missing, we replace it with a value of zero
and include an indicator = 1 for all students missing the given covariate. Our results are robust to excluding these
approximately 4 percent of students.

14

2012-13. Last, 𝑋𝑖 includes grade-by-subject fixed effects and we allow the slope on prior
achievement score to differ by subject and grade.

Estimates of the average treatment effect on student achievement, 𝛿 in Equation 1, are

reported in Table 3 Panel A. These are school-level intent-to-treat effects, and do not use any

variation in assigned teacher roles or treatment take-up. 18 Students in treatment schools score
about 0.06σ (student standard deviations) higher than their peers in control schools, on average
pooling math and reading outcomes. The difference is marginally statistically significant
(𝑝 = 0.08) when we control for pre-treatment covariates.

The estimated average treatment effect is somewhat larger when we focus on math

achievement alone (0.07σ; 𝑝 = 0.040) and somewhat smaller for reading and language arts

alone (0.05σ; 𝑝 = 0.072). This is consistent with the typical pattern in empirical research on

schooling: most general interventions affect reading achievement less than math achievement.
Additionally, the reading estimates are more sensitive to the inclusion of pre-treatment
covariates, though we cannot reject that the reading estimates in Column 1 and 2 are equivalent
statistically.
These average differences in student achievement can be interpreted as causal effects of
treatment under the traditional experimental design assumption: At the beginning of the
experiment, there was no difference in potential outcomes—student achievement growth, teacher
or school performance, etc.—between treatment and control samples. This assumption rests

18

We focus the paper’s discussion on ITT estimates. Only one of the seven treatment schools did not participate at
all in the Evaluation Partnership Program. The non-participating treatment school received the partnership match
lists and program materials just as the other six schools did, but chose not to move forward. Thus the implied firststage for a school-level TOT estimate would be about 0.86, suggesting the TOT estimates would be about 15 percent
larger than the numbers reported in Table 3 Panel A.

15

largely on the success of random assignment; evidence in support of successful random
assignment is presented in Table 2.
These positive average treatment effects are educationally and economically meaningful.
Gains of 0.06σ represent roughly one-third of a standard deviation in teacher performance, which
is typically estimated at 0.15-0.20σ in math and somewhat smaller in reading (Hanushek and
Rivkin 2010, Jackson, Staiger, and Rockoff 2014). Put differently, the 0.06σ difference is
roughly equivalent to the difference between being assigned to a median teacher and a 63rd
percentile teacher. Additionally, these average treatment effects are also roughly one-quarter the
estimated gain from reducing class size by 30 percent in elementary grades (Kruger 1999), or the
estimated gain from doubling the amount of class time middle and high school students spend in
math (Taylor 2014, Cortes, Goodman, and Nomi 2015). However, unlike reducing class size or
increasing class time, the current treatment—pairing classroom teachers to work together on
improving skills—does not require any meaningful increase in teacher salary expenditures.
2.2 Treatment Effects for Target Teachers and Other Teachers
Next we estimate treatment effects separately for teachers with different roles in the
partnership program. The experiment was designed first to improve the job performance of lowperforming “target” teachers; thus, the estimates in the top panel of Table 3 may mask important
heterogeneity by role. Teachers were assigned to one of three roles: (i) low-performing target
teachers, (ii) high-performing potential partner teachers, and (iii) all other teachers who were not
assigned a role in partnerships.
Building on Specification 1, we estimate the following regression to test for differences
by assigned teacher role:

16

𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 = 𝛿 𝑇 �𝐸𝑃𝑃𝑠(𝑗) ∗ 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑗(𝑖) � + 𝛿 𝑃 �𝐸𝑃𝑃𝑠(𝑗) ∗ 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑗(𝑖) � + 𝛿 𝑁 �𝐸𝑃𝑃𝑠(𝑗) ∗ 𝑁𝑜𝑅𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑗(𝑖) �
+ 𝛼 𝑃 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑗(𝑖) + +𝛼 𝑁 𝑁𝑜𝑅𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑗(𝑖) + 𝑋𝑖 𝛽 + 𝜋𝑏(𝑠) + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡

(2)

where 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑗 , 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑗 , and 𝑁𝑜𝑅𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑗 are a set of mutually-exclusive and exhaustive indicator

variables varying between teachers. This specification is algebraically equivalent to a more

conventional specification with a main effect of treatment and interactions with two of the three
teacher roles. 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑗 = 1 if teacher 𝑗 was listed as a low-performing target teacher on the

principal’s Evaluation Partnership Program report. Recall that the report was created for both
treatment and control schools, but only provided to treatment schools. Similarly, 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑗 = 1 if
teacher 𝑗 was listed as a high-performing potential partner (either in the recommended pairings

list or list of other potential partners). All other teachers have 𝑁𝑜𝑅𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑗 = 1, and were not listed

on the principal’s report. The estimates from Specification 2 are best interpreted as intent-to-treat
because the role indicators are based on the original reports created by the research team, and not
based on any post-randomization endogenous decisions by principals or teachers. All other
details of estimation are the same as for Specification 1.
Treatment effects are largest for low-performing target teachers. As reported in the
bottom panel of Table 3, treatment leads to test-score gains of 0.12σ in target teachers’
classrooms (compared to students of teachers who would have been target teachers in control
schools, pooling math and reading). The estimates for high-performing partner teachers are
positive, but much smaller and not statistically significant. Indeed the estimates for partner
teachers are quite similar to the estimates for teachers who were not assigned a role in the
program.

17

Again, these improvements are meaningful. A gain of 0.12σ is roughly equivalent to the
difference between being assigned to a median teacher instead of a bottom quartile teacher. A
gain of 0.12σ is also at least as large as the difference in performance between a novice teacher
and a 5 to 10 year veteran (Rockoff 2004, Papay and Kraft 2015). However, the gains for target
teachers are not necessarily substituting for experience gains. Later in the paper we examine
heterogeneity of treatment effects by experience.
Moreover, 0.12σ likely underestimates the effect of treatment on teachers who actually
participate in the program. Table 4 reports estimates of program take-up by teacher role (the first
stage results from a traditional 2SLS estimate of TOT). 19 Among treatment teachers assigned by
the research team to the target role, 61 percent participated in the program in the target role,
suggesting a treatment-on-the-treated estimate of about 0.20σ (= 0.12/0.61). These

improvements are large but similar to the gains documented by Taylor and Tyler (2012) studying
a program of evaluation and feedback, especially the gains Taylor and Tyler estimate for the exante lowest performing teachers.
2.3 Treatment Effects After Two Years
Last we estimate treatment effects one year after treatment. Table 5 shows estimates of
Specifications 1 and 2 using test score data for students taught by treatment and control teachers
in 2014-15. 20 The improvements in teacher performance persist, and perhaps grow, in the year
after treatment. The estimated effect for low-performing target teachers is 0.25σ, and marginally

19

The sample and specification are identical to Table 3 Panel B Column 1 following Equation 2, except that the
dependent variables are indicators for participation in a specific role.
20
Some of the 136 teachers in the sample switched schools between 2013-14 and 2014-15. As long as a teacher is
working in a Tennessee public school teaching grades 4-8 we include her in the sample. In these cases “school”, s, in
Specifications 1 and 2 for purposes of estimation is her school during 2013-14. For all teachers “role” is her program
role during 2013-14.

18

significant (𝑝 = 0.068, Column 1 Panel B). The estimated average treatment effect is also larger
at 0.11σ, though the p-value is 0.22 (Column 1 Panel A).

Two considerations are important in interpreting these second-year results. The first
consideration is attrition. The sample for Table 5 Column 1 includes 96 of the original 136
treatment and control teachers. Some teachers were not working in Tennessee public schools;
others switched to teaching non-tested grades or subjects. 21 To assess the potential influence of
this attrition, Columns 2 and 3 provide bounds for the treatment effect following the approach
described by Lee (2011). 22 Bounds for the average treatment effect are 0.05σ and 0.14σ. Bounds
for the effect among low-performing teacher teachers are 0.21σ and 0.34σ (with p-values of
0.052 and 0.040 respectively). In short, the continued performance improvement among target
teachers is robust to attrition, in part, perhaps, because attrition was relatively well balanced.
The second consideration is teachers who were target teachers in 2013-14 and again in
2014-15. In 2014-15 the treatment schools continued to use the Evaluation Partnership Program,
and teacher roles and partnerships were re-assigned based on evaluations from 2013-14. Two
teachers were recommended as target teachers in both years. These repeat target teachers may
have an outsized influence on the estimated year-two effect if the effect is increasing in the dose
of treatment, or if the improvement in performance only occurs in years when a teacher is
21

We find no statistically significant treatment effects on the probability that teachers leaving their school or stop
teaching altogether (at least in Tennessee public schools, results in Appendix Table A3).
22
Our setting requires one modification to the standard Lee bounds procedure. We are concerned about attrition at
the teacher level, but have outcome data at the student level. Thus determining which teachers to “trim” is not a
simple function of an observed variable. To determine which teachers to trim we follow these steps: (i) Estimate the
number of teachers who should be trimmed separately by role. The answer turns out to be trim one control target,
one treatment partner, and three control teachers with no role. (ii) Repeatedly estimate 𝛿̂ 𝑇 in Specification 2
excluding one control target teacher in each iteration. Identify the control target teacher 𝑗 whose exclusion
minimizes 𝛿̂ 𝑇 . (iii) Repeat step (ii) excluding partner teachers to find the exclusion which minimizes 𝛿̂ 𝑃 . (iv) Repeat
step (ii) excluding no-role teachers to find the exclusions which minimize 𝛿̂ 𝑁 . In this case each iteration excludes a
unique combination of three control no-role teachers. (v) The five teachers identified in steps (ii)-(iv) are the
teachers we trim to estimate the lower bound estimate. (vi) Repeat steps (ii)-(iv), this time maximizing each 𝛿̂ . , to
identify the five upper-bound teachers.

19

actively participating in a partnership. In Table 5 Column 4 we report estimates from a
specification identical to Column 1, except that treatment effect for target teachers is interacted
with an indicator = 1 if teacher 𝑗 was a target teacher in both years. Column 4 does not provide

causal estimates of one versus two years of treatment; being treated a second year is endogenous.
Column 4 does provide evidence consistent with improvements in job performance for target
teachers persist, perhaps grow, after treatment ends. The 0.25σ improvement holds for teachers
who were targets just one year, though it is not statistically significant.

3. Growth in Teachers’ Skills and Other Potential Mechanisms
While the previous section documents educationally meaningful and economically
significant impacts, the average effect estimates do not shed light on the mechanisms through
which the peer pairings influence productivity. We now move on to our second empirical
question: Can the improvements in student learning—the positive average treatment effects—be
attributed to growth in teachers’ skills from peer learning? Or are other changes in behavior or
effort behind the treatment effects?
In treatment schools, low-performing teachers were paired with a high-performing
partner, and each pair was explicitly asked to work together on improving teaching skills. Thus
our first hypothesized mechanism is teacher skill growth. Nevertheless, there are at least two
other potential mechanisms that could contribute to the treatment effects: changes in teachers’
motivation or effort, and changes in shared tasks (joint production) or resources. These three
categories of mechanism are not mutually exclusive; all three could be contributing, to varying
extents, to the average treatment effects. Jackson and Bruegmann (2009) describe how these
three categories of teacher spillovers likely affect performance in a typical school context. Our

20

discussion of these three mechanisms focuses on how the treatment’s pairing of teachers may
have changed that typical context. The experimental setting and control counterfactual rule out
many first-order features of these mechanisms as we highlight in the next paragraphs. Later we
present empirical tests of predictions from these three hypothesized mechanisms. We cannot test
all predictions empirically, especially in the case of the effort or motivation hypothesis, and thus
the analysis is not definitive. However, the tests we can conduct are a step toward sorting out the
relative contributions of different mechanisms.
While the stated purpose (to participating teachers) of the intervention was to improve
teacher instructional skills, a second potential mechanism is that program participation could
result in changes in teachers’ motivation or effort. Asking a low-performing teacher to spend
more time with a high-performing colleague, and talk together about performance explicitly, may
have made her more optimistic or enthusiastic about work or made her more embarrassed about
her poor performance. Similarly, treatment teachers may have felt more accountability to their
new partner. These interactions may, in turn, lead to increased effort—either transitory increases
in effort (e.g., motivated by specific accountability to ones’ partner or direct monitoring by ones’
partner) or lasting increases in effort (e.g., finding a new preferred equilibrium level of effort as a
result of interacting with ones’ partner). There is evidence for coworker effects on effort outside
the education sector (for example, Mas and Moretti 2009). However, the scope for changes in
optimism, embarrassment, or accountability is limited in the current experimental comparison:
the treatment likely increased the degree of interaction with one coworker, but the mix of
coworkers and typical coworker interactions were the same in treatment and control schools.
Furthermore, teachers (and particularly low-performing teachers) in Tennessee already face
fairly strong extrinsic incentives to increase their performance, as their schools are under

21

substantial test-based accountability pressures and as individuals they are at risk of losing their
jobs for low evaluation ratings. The effect of any marginal accountability to one’s partner is
likely to be small.
The third potential mechanism to consider is changes in teachers’ opportunities to share
resources or production tasks. Teacher partnerships formed by the treatment program may have
expanded to activities outside the original program scope. For example, teachers paired by the
treatment may have been more likely to share existing lesson plans or cooperate in creating new
lessons in ways that benefited productivity. Again, the control counterfactual rules out the
typical, first-order resource or task sharing among teachers within a school. For example,
teachers in treatment and control schools could exchange lessons and have group collaboration
time; thus, to explain treatment effects, the shared production must be a specific result of the new
partnership.
Our objective in this section is to present empirical evidence to help discriminate among
these three potential mechanisms. We have already seen two important empirical results that are
consistent with teacher skill growth. First, improvements in performance are largest for the lowperforming target teachers; the average effect was perhaps entirely driven by target teacher
improvements. Second, the performance improvements persisted, and perhaps even grew, in the
year after treatment ended. However, the pattern of larger effects for target teachers could result
from an asymmetric change in teachers’ motivation or effort, or an asymmetric change in
resource or tasks sharing as a result of treatment. Such changes might then persist after the
partnership has formally ended. In the remainder of this section, we present several additional
empirical tests. In short, we examine whether treatment effects vary with the characteristics of

22

teacher pairings in ways that are most consistent with skill growth or with either of the other two
potential mechanisms.
3.1 Learning Skills
First, if low-performing target teachers did learn new skills from their high-performing
partner, we would expect larger treatment effects when the partner teacher’s specific skill
strengths matched the target teacher’s specific weaknesses. In Table 6 Columns 2 through 5 we
test this prediction. (For ease of comparison, we reproduce our main results from Table 3 in
Column 1.) In Column 2, for the target teachers, we interact the treatment indicator with the
proportion of teacher 𝑗’s weak skill areas matched by her recommended partner’s strong skill
areas. 23 The “proportion skills matched” measure is based on the one-to-one pairings

recommended in the original principal reports (in the spirit, again, of intent-to-treat estimates).
We have standardized the “proportion skills matched” (mean 0, s.d. 1) for comparison with other
measures of pair characteristics in Table 6. Consistent with peer learning, the coefficient is
positive and statistically significant (𝑝 = 0.052). Student achievement gains are larger in pairs
where the high-performing teacher is better suited to teach new skills to her low-performing
partner.
Moreover, the result for “proportion skills matched” is not driven by target teachers who
simply have more weak skills to match on. In Column 3 we replace “proportion skills matched”
with “number of skills attempted to match”, and in Column 4 we include both simultaneously.
The target teacher’s number of weak skills does not itself predict a larger treatment effect; the

23

Recall that proposed pairings were determined algorithmically based on matches in 19 specific skill areas
measured in each teacher’s prior evaluation micro-data. We count up the number of skill areas in which there is a
match: the target teacher has a score less than 3 and the recommended partner has a score of 4 or greater (see
Section 1). Then, we divide the number of matches by the number of areas in which the target teacher scored less
than 3.

23

effect is larger only when weak skills are matched. By contrast, if attention to low skill scores, by
the program or by the partnership, generated a change in teacher effort, we would have expected
a positive coefficient on “number of skills attempted to match.”
In Column 5 we replace the continuous proportion matched with an indicator = 1 if the

proportion skills matched is above the pair median (about 0.5). This less-parametric approach
also shows larger performance improvements when target and partner teachers are better
matched on skills, and the estimates are more precise. In fact, the treatment effects appear

concentrated among target teachers who were better matched to partners with relevant skills to
share. By contrast, if low-performing target teachers’ motivation, effort, or joint production
behavior changed, we would likely see positive treatment effects even when there are few or no
strength-to-weakness skill matches. This is apparently not the case. The estimated treatment
effect when the proportion skills matched is below median (Column 5 Row 1) is positive
(0.036σ; 𝑝 = 0.340), but not statistically significant and similar in size to the point estimates for
partner and no assigned role teachers.

Evidence for skill growth is also apparent when we examine other aspects of teacher
performance. To this point we have focused on performance as measured by student test score
growth. Table 7 reports treatment effects for a second measure of teacher performance:
evaluation scores from direct, in-class observations of teaching practices. (These are observation
scores from teachers’ formal evaluations described in Section 1.) In Column 1 the outcome is
teacher 𝑗’s average score across all 19 skills and all classroom observations. 24 All outcome

variables are standardized (mean 0, s.d. 1). As measured in direct observations, target teachers’
24

As described in Section 1, teachers are scored on 19 skills multiple times per year. We first calculate an average
score for each skill, standardize the skill scores, and then average the skill scores to obtain the overall average. We
use all post-randomization scores from 2013-14 and 2014-15. We regress each outcome on a treatment indicator,
randomization block fixed effects, and controls for teacher experience to improve precision.

24

skills improve on average by a marginally significant 0.05 teacher standard deviations. The
coefficients for partner teachers are similar in magnitude, but estimates for both partner and norole teachers have very wide (implicit) confidence intervals.
Consistent with the skill growth mechanism, notably, target teachers’ improvements are
concentrated in skills where there was a match—a match between the target’s weak skills and
her partner’s strong skills. We examine treatment effects separately (Column 2) for the subset of
skills where was a match—the target scored less than 3 and her partner scored 4 or higher—and
(Column 3) the subset of skills where the target was weak—she scored less than 3—but there
was no match. We also report (Column 4) the effect for skill areas where we did not attempt to
match because the target scored 3 or higher. 25 In matched skills target teachers improved 0.27
teacher standard deviations. But, by contrast, target teachers improved much less, if at all, in
weak skill areas where there was no match with a partner strength. In summary, performance
gains are larger in skill areas where the high-performing teacher is better suited to teach new
skills to her low-performing partner. 26
3.2 Motivation or Effort
The evidence presented above is largely consistent with teachers building skills, rather
than simply increasing motivation or effort. Here, we present additional evidence to differentiate
between these mechanisms. If changes in effort contributed to the treatment effects, we might
expect the treatment effect to be positively correlated with the size of the gap between the target
25

For any individual teacher these three categories are mutually exclusive. Each of the 19 skills must belong to one
and only one of matched, no matched, or not attempted to match.
26
One note of caution in interpreting these classroom observation results. Many of the observations are conducted
by the school principal who, in treatment schools, was certainly aware of the program and its goals of improved
practices and improved evaluation scores. Treatment principals may have, consciously or unconsciously, inflated
observations scores to recognize participation in the program; or, alternatively, principals may have been more
critical or more aware of low-performance as a result of the program. However, to produce the results in Table 7, the
principals would have had to differentially score target teachers on the matched skills specifically.

25

teacher’s baseline job performance and her partner’s baseline performance. For example, Mas
and Moretti (2009) find that low-performing grocery check-out clerks increase their work effort
when a higher-performing peer works at the same time and can observe the low-performer’s
effort; but high-performers are not affected by other high-performers. We test this prediction in
Table 6 Columns 6-9, interacting the treatment indicator with the difference in prior-year skill
measures. Note that while a positive correlation would be consistent with motivation, it might
also be consistent with peer learning. A larger gap in skills may indicate a pair where the highperformer has more things to teach her partner.
Looking across the estimates in these columns, we do not find evidence of such a positive
correlation. In fact, the imprecise point estimates are all negative. In Column 6, we examine
differences in prior-year classroom observation scores (partner teacher minus target teacher).
These observation scores are the rubric scores gathered in the formal evaluation process
described in Section 1. The point estimate is small, negative, and not statistically significant. In
Column 7 we include interactions for both difference in observation scores (possibly indicative
of effort) and proportion skills matched (indicative of learning). Both measures have been
standardized (mean 0, s.d. 1 throughout Table 6) to facilitate comparisons like Column 7. If
anything, the coefficient on proportion skills matched is more positive than in Column 2, and the
coefficient on observation scores more negative than in Column 6.
In Columns 8 and 9 we use an alternative measure of the gap between the target and
partner baseline performance: the difference in prior “value added scores”. 27 Value added scores
are designed to measure each individual teacher’s contribution to student test score growth. The

27

We use value added scores provided by the state’s TVAAS evaluation system. We calculate an overall value
added score for each teacher by averaging all her subject-by-year value added scores from 2011-12 and 2012-13.

26

pattern for difference in value added is quite similar to the pattern for difference in observation
scores.
3.3 Sharing Resources or Tasks
The third mechanism category concerns new opportunities to share productive resources
or job tasks. Being paired with another teacher may foster willingness or opportunities to
collaborate at work in ways that improve performance even if the target teacher’s skills do not
change. Under this hypothesis we would expect the treatment effect to be greater when teacher
pairs teach the same grade-level or subject area. The assumption motivating this test is that, even
absent the treatment, shared production activities are easier or higher-return when teachers teach
the same grade-level or subject. Sharing lesson plans is a simple concrete example: for a 6th
grade mathematics teacher, sharing plans with another 6th grade math teacher would be more
helpful than with an 8th grade teacher or a social studies teacher. To test this mechanism, in
Column 10, we interact the target treatment effect with an indicator = 1 if the target and partner
teachers are both teaching the subject 𝑘. In Column 11, we interact the effect with an indicator

= 1 if the target and partner are both teaching the same grade level(s). 28 In both cases the point

estimate is positive, which would be consistent with this third mechanism. But in both cases the
estimates are small and (implicit) confidence intervals are quite wide—we could not reject large
negative effects inconsistent with this mechanism. Furthermore, the estimated treatment effects
for teachers in non-matched grades and subjects remains large, statistically significant, and of
approximately the same magnitude as in Column 1. And, as above, this effect could derive in

28

In practice teachers often teach more than one grade level, especially in middle and high school. We calculate the
student-weighted average of grade level for each teacher. The indicator is = 1 if the difference in that average grade
level is less than one.

27

part because peer learning is facilitated by shared subject or grade level. In short, we do not find
strong evidence for a shared production mechanism.
To summarize the results across the three mechanism categories, first, we find evidence
consistent with the hypothesis that low-performing target teachers learn new skills from their
high-performing partner. Namely, improvements in performance, as measured by student test
scores, are concentrated among target teachers; improvements are larger when more deficient
skills are matched by the partner’s skills; and improvements persist, perhaps grow, in the year
following treatment. Additionally, improvements, as measured in classroom observations, are
concentrated in matched skills. By contrast, predictions for other mechanisms are not borne out
in our data. We do not find evidence consistent with a motivation or effort hypothesis, nor a
shared resources or task hypothesis. Our empirical tests are partial and the three mechanisms are
not mutually exclusive, so we cannot rule out any of these mechanisms. However, the available
evidence suggests skill growth accounts for part of, perhaps much of, the average treatment
effect.

4. Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper we study on-the-job learning among classroom teachers, especially learning
skills from coworkers, in a field experiment. We document meaningful improvements in job
performance among treatment teachers, and the patterns of performance gains suggest teachers
learned job skills from their colleagues. The gains are empirical evidence of the intuitive, longtheorized benefits of coworkers in human capital development.
The relatively low-performing teachers targeted by our intervention—and ultimately their
students—benefited substantially from partnering with a higher-performing colleague at their

28

school. Target teachers’ performance improved 0.12 student standard deviations in the year of
treatment, and perhaps double that much in the following year. These performance
improvements were larger when teacher partnerships were better matched on strong and weak
skills, but otherwise we find little evidence of heterogeneity.
Our estimates are consistent with prior evidence of learning from coworkers among
teachers. Jackson and Bruegmann (2009) find that when a teacher begins working with higherperforming colleagues her own performance improves as a result. A one standard deviation
increase in peer performance, as measured by prior contributions to student test score growth,
generates a 0.03-0.04σ improvement in own performance, also measured with current student
test scores. Importantly, Jackson and Bruegmann define “working with” as teaching in the same
grade and school as the peer; the peer work we study is more direct, and the effects are larger.
Taylor and Tyler (2012) find that teacher performance improves 0.05σ during a school year in
which a teacher from a different school and the school principal conduct classroom-observationbased evaluations and subsequently provides feedback. Both Jackson and Bruegmann (2009) and
Taylor and Tyler (2012) report that the gains in performance are sustained into the future; indeed
in the latter case the effects grow from 0.05σ during the peer evaluation year to 0.10σ in the
years after the peer evaluation year. We similarly find that performance improvements persist,
perhaps grow, in the year following treatment.
Particularly notable, the treatment effects for target teachers appear to hold for both
experienced and inexperienced teachers. In other words, the treatment is not simply substituting
for the returns to experience. If anything, the treatment effect was 0.03σ larger for target teachers
with more than ten years of experience, though the result is far from statistically significant
(Appendix Table A2). Performance growth for experienced teachers is rare in the literature, but

29

this result is consistent with results in Taylor and Tyler (2012). In Appendix Table A2 we
examine several potential sources of heterogeneity, including teaching experience, prior
performance, school level, and the difference in experience between target and partner. None
show a statistically significant relationship to the treatment effect.
The experiment and results suggest practical alternatives to formal on-the-job training,
especially in professional occupations. The contrast in approaches is particularly strong in the
case of teachers. Formal courses, called “professional development,” are today the primary
approach to on-the-job training for public school teachers. Collectively K-12 schools spend
about $18 billion per year on professional development courses, of which $3 billion is paid to
external providers (Gates Foundation 2014); the average teacher spends at least 20 hours each
year in “professional development”. 29 Despite the substantial commitment of resources, the
empirical evidence suggests little effect on teacher performance (see reviews by Jackson,
Rockoff, and Staiger 2014, and Yoon et al. 2007). Similarly, public school systems spend
tremendous resources paying for teachers’ graduate tuition, and paying higher salaries once
teachers’ obtain their graduate degree. There is limited evidence that such degrees significantly
improve teacher effectiveness (Jackson, Rockoff, and Staiger 2014).
By contrast, the one-on-one personalized approach to on-the-job training we study in this
paper is apparently much more successful and much less costly. The primary marginal cost for
treatment schools was the time that target and partner teachers allocated to working with each
other. The opportunity cost of that time is important, although it could plausibly substitute for the
time teachers would have spent in formal professional development courses. The cost is low in
part because the high-performing coworker provides the teaching expertise. There could be
29

Author’s calculation from the Schools and Staffing Survey 2011-12.

30

additional costs if higher-performing partners substitute away from other activities, especially
attention to their own students. However, we do not find evidence of reduced performance
among the higher-performing partners. If anything, the high-performers may have also benefited
from participating in the pairings.
One important contextual feature of the experiment is the formal teacher evaluation
system. All teachers in our study—treatment and control, target and partner and no role—are
subject to Tennessee’s new formal performance evaluation system. Teacher pairs were identified
based on prior evaluation results, and teacher pairs were encouraged, in part, to work on
improving evaluation results. These connections to formal evaluation likely influenced
principals’ and teachers’ willingness to participate, and the nature of their participation. For these
reasons we think this study has contributions for the small, still-developing literature on how
evaluation affects teacher performance (Taylor and Tyler 2012, Steinberg and Sartain 2015,
Bergman and Hill 2015). One additional result on this subject comes from a survey of teachers at
the end of the experiment. Teachers were asked a series of questions to measure their attitude
toward formal evaluation, for example, “I have a favorable impression of the teacher evaluation
system” rated on a six point agree/disagree scale. 30 Judging from survey responses, teachers in
treatment schools left with more favorable opinions of evaluation: attitudes about evaluation
were 0.23 standard deviations more positive, as measured by a composite of the four survey
questions. However, survey response rates were lower in treatment schools (approximately 45
30

The other three questions on this topic were: “In general, my colleagues have a favorable impression of the
teacher evaluation system” and “I receive valuable feedback and guidance through teacher evaluation that helps me
improve” both rated in the six point agree/disagree scale. And “What do you feel is the primary purpose of the
teacher evaluation system? To help teachers improve. To rate teachers. Some of both.” Surveys were collected by
the authors working directly with participating schools.
To create a composite score for evaluation attitudes we conducted a factor analysis of these questions and use the
predicted first factor as our dependent variable. The factor analysis inputs were the three agree/disagree responses
and separate binary indicators for “To help teachers improve” and “To rate teachers”. The first factor explains nearly
100 percent of the variation in responses to these four questions.

31

percent versus 66 percent), and thus this result should be interpreted with caution. If treatment
suppressed responses from teachers with negative opinions, then the treatment effect on attitudes
could easily be negative, but the empirical direction of any non-response bias is not clear.
The teacher job performance improvements documented in this paper suggest learning
from colleagues is at least as valuable as formal on-the-job training or the gains from experience
in developing teaching skills. Indeed peer learning may be a key contributor to the oft-cited
estimates of returns to experience in teaching. Most practically, the treatment and results suggest
promising ideas for managing the sizable teacher workforce.

Pre-experiment covariates

Note: Panel A: Each cell is an estimate from a separate regression. The dependent variable is a student test score,
standardized (mean 0, standard deviation 1) within subject by grade-level cells using the statewide student
distribution. All regressions include randomization block fixed effects. The vector of pre-experiment covariates
includes: (i) Baseline student achievement: the average of each student's prior year math and reading scores. Prior
test-score slope is allowed to vary by outcome subject and grade-level. (ii) Teacher pre-experiment value-added in
the outcome subject: the average of 2012-13 and 2011-12 TVASS scores. (iii) Indicators for student gender,
race/ethnicity, English language learner status, special education status, and whether the student is repeating the
grade. When baseline test scores or value-added are missing we set the value to zero and include an indicator = 1 for
missing. If the student had two or more teachers in a given subject, we include one observation per teacher and
weight each observation by the proportion of responsibility allocated by the state to the teacher. Three quarters of
students had one teacher in a given subject.
Panel B: Each column reports estimates from a separate regression. Estimation is identical to Panel A, except that
the single treatment indicator is replaced with three indicators: treatment * target teacher, treatment * partner
teacher, and treatment * no assigned role. The specification also includes main effects for teacher role (i.e., "partner"
and "no assignment" with "target" the omitted category).
P-values in brackets for the test that the coefficient equals zero. P-values estimated using wild cluster (school)
bootstrap-t methods (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008) with 500 replications

roles respectively. The sample includes 14 schools, 2,947 students, and 136 teachers.

Note: Each column within panels reports estimates from a separate regression. The dependent variable is a student
test score from spring 2015, standardized (mean 0, s.d. 1) within subject by grade-level cells using the statewide
distribution. All regressions include randomization block fixed effects, and the vector of pre-experiment covariates
described in Table 3. Additionally, Panel B regressions include main effects for teacher role (i.e., "partner" and "no
assignment" with "target" the omitted category). Columns 2 and 3 report lower and upper bounds on the treatment
effect estimate following the approach suggested by Lee (2009). We trim at the teacher level (dropping all students
assigned to the trimmed teachers) within groups defined by teacher role (target, partner, no role) as described in the
text. Column 4 repeats the specification and sample in Column 1, but adds an interaction between the target
treatment effect and an indicator = 1 if the teacher was a target in year two. Regressions are weighted as described in
Table 3. The sample includes 14 schools, 2,876 students, and 96 teachers.
P-values in brackets for the test that the coefficient equals zero. P-values estimated using wild cluster (school)
bootstrap-t methods (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008) with 500 replications.

Note: Each column reports estimates from a separate regression. Column 1 is identical to Table 3 Panel B Column 2. For Columns 2-11, all details of estimation
are the same as Column 1 (see notes for Table 3), except that we add various characteristics of the target teacher and teacher pair as additional right-hand-side
variables, and interact those characteristics with the treatment indicator for target teachers. The interaction coefficients are shown above. In each case the
regression also includes a main effect for characteristic shown above. A "skill match" occurs when the target teacher has a score below 3 in the skill and the
assigned partner has a score of 4 or higher (19 skills possible). The denominator in "proportion skills matched" is the number of skills where the target has a low
score. All "difference" measures are partner score minus target score. The "proportion", "difference", and "number" measures have been standardized (mean 0,
s.d. 1) within the sample. "Both teaching the same subject" is an indicator = 1 if assigned partner and target both teach the subject of the outcome score (math or
reading). "Both teaching the same grade" is an indicator = 1 if the difference in average grade level of the assigned partner's students and the average grade level
of the target's students is less than one. When a pair characteristic is missing we set the value to zero and include an indicator = 1 for missing. Regressions are
weighted as described in Table 3. The sample includes 14 schools, 2,947 students, and 136 teachers.
P-values in brackets for the test that the coefficient equals zero. P-values estimated using wild cluster (school) bootstrap-t methods (Cameron, Gelbach, and
Miller 2008) with 500 replications.

Note: Each cell reports an estimate from a separate regression. The dependent variable is a measure of observed
teaching practices from formal classroom observations conducted as part of the teacher's performance evaluation
(see text for more details). In Column 1 the outcome is the teacher's average score across all 19 skills. In Columns 2
through 4 the outcome is the target teacher's average score across a specific subset of skills described in the column
headers. The skills which contribute to each subset differ from teacher to teacher. But for any given teacher the three
columns are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Evaluation scores contributing to the dependent variables are from
the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years. Dependent variables are standardized (mean 0, standard deviation 1), and
each of the 19 skill scores was standardized before taking averages. All regressions include randomization block
fixed effects, and controls for teacher experience (indicators for quartiles of teacher experience).
P-values in brackets for the test that the coefficient equals zero. P-values estimated using wild cluster (school)
bootstrap-t methods (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008) with 500 replications.

Note: Each column reports estimates from a separate regression. The dependent variable is a student test score,
standardized (mean 0, s.d. 1) within subject by grade-level cells using the statewide distribution. All regressions
include randomization block fixed effects, and the vector of pre-experiment covariates described in Table 3.
Additionally, all regressions include main effects for teacher role (i.e., "partner" and "no assignment" with "target"
the omitted category). In each specification we interact the treatment indicator with a characteristic of the target
teacher, pair, or partner teacher. When a characteristic is missing we set the value to zero and include an indicator =
1 for missing. Regressions are weighted as described in Table 3. The sample includes 14 schools, 2,947 students,
and 136 teachers.
P-values in brackets for the test that the coefficient equals zero. P-values estimated using wild cluster (school)

Note: Each column within panels reports estimates from a separate LPM regression. The dependent variable is an
indicator = 1 if the teacher is no longer teaching in the same school (or in the state of Tennessee) in 2014-15 the year
after treatment in 2013-14 (or 2015-16 two years after treatment). All regressions include randomization block fixed
effects. Additionally, all regressions in Panel B include main effects for teacher role (i.e., "partner" and "no
assignment" with "target" the omitted category). The sample includes 14 schools, and 136 teachers.
P-values in brackets for the test that the coefficient equals zero. P-values estimated using wild cluster (school)
bootstrap-t methods (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008) with 500 replications.
