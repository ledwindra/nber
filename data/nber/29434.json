    "abstract": "\n\nIn a deterministic overlapping-generations economy with production and physical capital, the market value of debt is not necessarily equal to the present discounted value of future budget surpluses: it can be positive without any budget surpluses being in the o\ufb03ng, because debt incorporates a rational bubble. Yet the dynamics of debt remain a function of the dynamics of the primary budget de\ufb01cit. The true \ufb01scal cost of excessive government debt issuance cannot be assessed just from the current rate of interest or any current macroeconomic variable. Rather, it should be assessed in a dynamic context re\ufb02ecting anticipated de\ufb01cits and population growth going forward. As a way to study their joint behavior, we specify the variation of a structural de\ufb01cit in the form of an underfunded social-security scheme. We de\ufb01ne debt capacity as the level of debt that can be just sustained without a change of policy all the way to an unstable steady state. When it starts below the capacity, the debt converges to a stable steady state, in which the bubble is sustained. Above capacity the bubble unravels and the de\ufb01cit cannot be \ufb01nanced. In several realistic scenarios occurring in economies, we calculate the needed policy response, which is the true \u201c\ufb01scal cost\u201d of exceeding debt capacity.\n\n",
