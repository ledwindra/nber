The Reaction of Reduced-Form Coefficients to Regime Changes:
The Case of Interest Rates

ABSTRACT

This study investigates whether the apparent intertemporal
instability of a particular reduced-form equation (that for interest rates)
can be explained by changing government policy parameters, or regimes, and

otherwise stable structural parameters. We hypothesize that major fiscal,
monetary, and regulatory policy parameter shifts have been important

sources of that instability. Direct tests imply that reduced-form
coefficients move by statistically significant and economically meaningful

amounts in response to policy parameter change. Allowing for this
systematic parameter variation produces greater stability in the remaining

parameters. Furthermore, in-sample and out—of-sample forecasts from the
proposed model outperform those from the non-responsive parameter
specification.

A. Introduction
For more than a decade, empirical studies have sought to determine whether
nominal interest rates adjust such that real rates are unaffected by changes in

the anticipated inflation rate (the Fisher neutrality hypothesis).

An

unsettling aspect of these studies is the volatility of the estimated interest
rate response to anticipated inflation over various sample periods.' Estimates

based on data for the 1950s provided low and insignificant values for the
response.2

As the sample period was extended, larger point estimates of the

response were obtained, finally approaching unity. Carlson (1979), Cargill and
Meyer (1980) and Levi and Makin (1979) produce estimated interest rate responses

that decline, often dramatically, when the sample period is extended to include

the first half of the 1970s. Peek and Wilcox (1983) find that the inclusion of
income tax and aggregate supply shock effects reduces, but does not eliminate,

the observed coefficient instability.

This suggests other relevant factors

remain.

The Lucas (1976) critique suggests that conventional reduced—form coef-

ficients may vary over time due to the dependence of private sector expec—
tational parameters on government policy parameters.

Sims (1982) has recently

countered that this objection should be regarded as no more than a "cautionary
footnote" (p. 108) since policy rules "have not changed frequently or by large
amounts" (p. 138). He argues that in fact there has been little drift in (final

form) parameter estimates through time. Here we test directly whether changes

in policy parameters have produced changes in reduced—form parameters.

We

hypothesize that significant, quantifiable changes have occurred in the policy
parameters that are especially relevant to the reduced form for interest rates.

We incorporate these para—meters in our model and investigate whether the

—1—

apparent intertemporal instabil—ity of the reduced—form equation for interest
rates can be explained by the changing values of government policy parameters
through time and otherwise stable structural parameters.

We address three major sources of change in the government's policy parame—
t ers :

1) changes in fiscal policy parameters,
2) changes in monetary policy parameters, and
3) changes in financial regulatory policy parameters.
The first category is exemplified by changes in personal tax rates. Peek (1982)

presents evidence that changing tax rates significantly affect interest rates
and that incorporating their movements substantially reduces the instability of
interest rate coefficients.

Furthermore, Peek and Wilcox (1984) find that such

tax effects are complete; that is, there is no evidence of the 'fiscal illusion

suggested by Tanzi (1980).

The second category of policy parameter change is

typified by the October 1979 change in monetary policy (as well as by the 1951

Treasury Accord). The creation of negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) in
the early 1960s and of six—month money—market certificates in the late 1970s and

the elimination of interest rate ceilings on large CDs in the early 1970s
exemplify the regulatory changes most directly relevant to financial markets.

By reducing the degree of disintermediation when rates rise, these financial
innovations may have reduced the impact of monetary restraint through credit

availability and thus may have decreased the interest elasticity of private
expenditures. To the extent each of these policies influence structural para-

meters, the reduced—form response of nominal interest rates to anticipated
inflation (and to other factors) will vary with regime changes.

Below we present a simple macro model which highlights the link between

—2—

policy parameters and reduced—form coefficients. Sections C and D describe the

estimation and measurement methodology and present our empirical results. The
final section concludes.

where t is the marginal tax rate on interest Income and pe is the anticipated

Real expenditures depend on the real after—tax interest rate, an investment

accelerator term, exogenous real export and real government demand, and real

shocks emanating from the supply side.

In addition, the presence of the

liquidity variable (LIQ) allows us to capture the difference between short—run

and long—run IS curves. This difference follows from the assumed differential
adjustment speeds in real and financial markets. Since real variables (such as

—4—

output) adjust more slowly than financial variables (such as interest rates), we

hypothesize a steeper (e.g., vertical) short—run IS curve. The liquidity term
represents accelerations (or decelerations) in nominal money growth relative to
normal. Given an acceleration in nominal money growth, the LM curve would shift

to the right and the economy would move from point A to point B along the verMovement down the short—run IS curve is

tical short—run IS curve in Figure 1.

captured by a temporary downward shift of the flatter long—run IS curve to IS'.

Thus, this term allows us to capture the well known liquidity effect.

If this

higher growth rate persists, LIQ returns to its long—run value of zero and the
IS curve returns to its original position.

Money demand is hypothesized to depend on output and on the after—tax nomi-

nal interest rate, which represents the opportunity cost of holding money when

interest income is taxed. The third argument in the money demand function (a)
represents a measure of the capital—value risk associated with holding bonds as

alternatives to money in wealth portfolios (see Slovin and Sushka (1983) for
discussion and empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis). The wage and
price equations embody the natural rate hypothesis.

Equation (5) posits a monetary authority (Fed) policy whereby the money
supply rises and falls with the expected price level, natural real output, and

the real interest rate. The Fed almost certainly has reacted to other factors
as well, e.g., cyclical unemployment, inflation, international forces, and the
preferences of individual policymakers.

Shifts in the slope parameter ei in

(5), however, can be viewed as capturing some of the major policy shifts of the

postwar period. That parameter measures the extent to which the Fed stabilizes

interest rates in practice, i.e., accommodates. This parameter can be thought

of as a measure of the degree to which the nominal money supply (given e and

pegging of interest rates after the 1951 Treasury Accord, the increased emphasis

on monetary aggregates in the l970s, and the October 1979 shift to reserves
targeting can each be represented by changes in the policy parameter ei. Since
each of these changes involved moving toward a less procyclical monetary policy
(and a steeper effective LM curve), each can be characterized as a reduction in
e1.

The sign of f is Indeterminate a priori.

An adverse supply shock reduces

investment and real wages and thus the interest rate, while at the same time
increasing input costs operating through the aggregate supply equation which
raises the interest rate. The investment—real wage effect might be expected to
dominate, suggesting a negative value for 86. The results presented in Peek and
Wilcox (1983) and Wilcox (1983a, 1983b) support this interpretation.

The three policy parameters t, e1, and ai are of particular interest. To
the extent that any of these parameters (or for that matter, any of the struc-

tural parameters) vary over time, the reduced—form coefficients will also
change.

Insofar as the structural parameter in question enters more than one

reduced—form coefficient, the B's will covary deterministically. For example,

the marginal tax rate (t) enters all of the reduced—form coefficients in the

same way. An increase in the tax rate will raise not only the interest rate
response to expected inflation, but also all of the other reduced—form coefficients. A decrease in the response of private expenditures to the real after—
tax interest rate (ai) will reduce the denominators of all eight B's by the same
amount.

However, since a1 also appears in the numerator of 81, the interest

rate response to the expected inflation rate will be differentially affected;
the decrease in a1 will raise all of the other reduced—form coefficients, while

the response to expected inflation will be reduced.

Similarly, a decrease in

e1 will raise all of the B's except Bi through its effect on D. But, as with

—8--

al, ei also enters the numerator of .

In

this instance, however, the direc-

tion of the net effect of the change in e1 on

is ambiguous a priori.

C. Methodology
Equations (9)—(17) Illustrate the relationship between policy parameters and

the reduced—form coefficients.

Our hypothesis is that failure to allow for

movements over time in these policy parameters has contributed to observed
reduced—form estimate instability.

We rectify this shortcoming by including

values of the time series of the proxies for fiscal, monetary, and regulatory
policy parameters.

This allows us to test directly for the significance of

policy changes in explaining reduced—form coefficient variability and to evaluate whether the remaining, deeper parameters are stable. Incorporating fiscal

policy parameter movements requires a measure of the marginal tax rate of the
marginal investor, t. If a tax—exempt institution is the marginal investor, the

marginal tax rate is zero.

If individuals are the marginal investors, the

appropriate tax rate is the marginal personal income tax rate. The progressi—
vity of the personal income tax rates makes measuring that rate problematic. As

our measure of t, we use the average marginal tax rate on interest income
constructed from data contained in annual editions of Statistics of Income,
Individual Income Tax Returns (see Peek (1982)). The tax rate is calculated as

a weighted average of the marginal personal income tax rate for each adjusted
gross income class.

The weight for each class is equal to its share of the

total interest received by all income classes.4

A downward drift in the measured interest rate response to expected inflation as the sample period was extended into the 1970s has been noted by Carison
(1979), Cargill and Meyer (1980), and Levi and Makin (1979). This may be due to

the continuing financial institution deregulation and consequent reduction In

—9—

disintermediation.

A number of regulatory changes reduced the potential for

disintermediation throughout that period (e.g. ,

the creation of negotiable cer-

tificates of deposit, increases in Regulation Q ceilings, the introduction of
six—month money market certificates).

Such changes might reduce the interest

response of private expenditures (a1), thereby lowering the reduced—form coef—
5

ficient on expected inflation (see equation (10)).

We allow for changing regulatory policy (and innovation) with a measure of
the effect of such changes rather than attempting to quantify the changes them-

selves. To do so, we take as our regulatory policy indicator, s, the share of
commercial banks' and thrift institutions' liabilities that pay market—related
interest rates. We assume that the interest response of expenditures is a function of s and DCC:

a1 =

f + (f1 + f2/s)DCC,

(18)

where DCC is a dummy variable that takes a value of unity when the three—month

Treasury bill yield exceeds the regulation Q ceiling interest rate on savings
deposits and is zero otherwise. Thus, DCC switches on when disintermediation is

likely. The extent to which a1 changes then depends upon the share of liabilities subject to disintermediation. We also allow the IS curve intercept (a) to
move during these periods so as not to constrain the IS function to pivot about
its horizontal intercept:

a =

In this specification, f(>0) represents the (absolute value of the) interest

response of expenditures in the non—disintermediation periods.

included to pick up the long—term increase in velocity. The last term in (20)
indicates a first—order autocorrelation correction coefficient estimate of 0.90.
This specification allows e1 ,

the reaction of the money supply to expected

real interest rates, to vary across the regimes of the different Fed chairmen,
but restricts it to be constant within regimes. The four intercept dummies are
included to lessen the likelihood that variations in the overall stringency of

monetary policy across regimes be mistakenly attributed to variations in the
systematic—response coefficient, i.e., to avoid empirically confusing intercept

and slope shifts in the money supply function.

The estimated time series for

the money supply reaction coefficient can be read directly from (20).

The

values for e1 are 0.35, 1.38, 1.12, and —0.012 for 1952:06—1970:06,
1970:12—1978:06, 1978:12—1979:06, and 1979:12—1983:06, respectively.

This

series suggests that the Voicker regime has accommodated real rate shocks least

while the Burns and Miller years saw the most accommodation.

The William

McChesney Martin regime appears to have been in between. F—tests allow us to
reject the hypothesis that the money supply reaction coefficient, e1, was the

same across Fed chairmen.6 M is also based on (20). M is

minus the

estimated trend, credIt control and real—rate—reactIon elements. Movements in
the intercept dummies plus the error term, u, imply that monetary policy
loosened from the latter 1950s until the early 1970s and has been tighter than
average since the tnld—1970s, especially during the Voicker years.

D. Empirical Results

This section presents the results of estimating (8) subject to (9)—(19).
When e1, f1, f2, and f4 are taken to be zero through time, constant—coefficient,

ordinary least squares (OLS) suffices.

These restrictions are equivalent to

setting M to equal (M_pe_YN), e1 equal to zero, and a1 equal to a constant. As
a result, (8) can be expressed as:

Tanzi (1980) suggests that individuals have suffered from "fiscal illusion"

by falling to take complete account of tax rates.

Peek (1982), using a

1960—1979 sample, can be interpreted as testing the hypothesis that individuals
rather than tax—exempt institutions are the marginal investors in the six—month

and one—year Treasury bill market. Alternatively, the null hypothesis could be
that individuals are the marginal investors but ignore income tax considerations

In making their financial decisions. Using the Davidson—McKinnon (1981) non—
nested model specification test, the non—tax adjusted model (equivalent to our
equations (21)—(23) with t = 0) was rejected in favor of the tax—adjusted for-

mulation (equations (21)—(23)) using an index of marginal personal income tax
rates. Employing a more detailed model incorporating supply shock and foreign—

held bond effects, Peek and Wilcox (1983) reconfirmed these results for the
entire 1952—79 period for the one—year Treasury bill rate. We also showed how
changes over time in the correlations between the anticipated inflation rate and
the tax rate and supply shock variable contributed to previously measured inter—

temporal instability in the estimated expected inflation coefficients. Further,
Peek and Wilcox (1984) estimate a specification similar to (21)—(23) with (1—t)

replaced by (1—Ot), where 8 reflects the degree of (lack of) fiscal illusion.
Using nonlinear least squares, the estimate of 8 closely approximates one, indi-

cating no fiscal Illusion.

Therefore, we here restrict 8 to unity, implying

complete adjustment to changes in tax rate policies. From (23), it can be seen
that (1—t) can be factored Out of the coefficient of each explanatory variable.

Using our tax rate series, we can express (21) with constant reduced—form coef-

ficients when we divide each of the right—hand—side variables by (1—t).

The

implied reduced—form coefficients at any time are then the estimated constant
coefficients times the value of (1—t) for that period.

Table 1 presents the results of estimating (21). June and December averages

of the secondary market yield (on a bond equivalent basis) on one—year U.S.
Treasury bills are used as the dependent variable. e is the Livingston one—
year expected inflation rate, recorded in June and December. This measure of
expected inflation has the advantages of being truly ex ante and of embodying
whatever sophistication agents actually use to form their expectations.7

The

remaining variables are measured with second and fourth quarter data (except a).

Ml is the nominal money supply. e is the price level expected six months ahead

from the Livingston survey data. N, natural real output, is from the Council
of Economic Advisors.

(M_Pe_YN) has been detrended by regressing its log on a

linear time trend and using the residual as M'. LIQ is the difference between

the annualized growth rate of Ml measured from the current to the previous
quarter and its four—quarter growth rate up to that previous quarter. X' is the
logarithm of the ratio of real government expenditures plus real exports to real

natural output. LY is the four—quarter growth rate of real CNP up to the preceding quarter.

SS is the ratio of the import deflator to the CNP deflator,

adjusted for exchange rate changes. a is the 18—month moving standard deviation

of the after—tax nominal interest rate, lagged one month.

D7983 is a dummy

variable that takes the value one starting with the December 1979 observation.

The June 1980 observation has been omitted due to the presence of credit
controls; otherwise, the full sample is 1952:06—1983:06.

The estimates in row 1 imply that rises in expected inflation, exogenous
spending, faster real growth, and more volatile interest rates raise rates while

accelerations in money growth, higher real balances, and positive supply shocks

each lower them.

After 1979 interest rates were both surprisingly high and

volatile. Row 2 shows that when the post—1979 period is added to the sample,

the standard error of the estimate rises by 69 percent and the measure of
interest rate variability gains in significance.

This appears to confirm the

popular attribution of the high post—1979 interest rates to sharply increased
interest rate volatility. Including D7983 in row 3, however, reduces the effect
of volatility to insignificance. The coefficient of 4.21 on D7983 in row 3 indi-

cates that the surprises were large and primarily on the upside.

However, even

allowing for this nonexplained upward shift leaves the standard error of the
estimate much larger than before 1979.

Adding the post—1979 period seems to change the estimated coefficients rela-

tively little. When a time series of the expected inflation coefficient esti-

mate is generated by rolling over a fourteen—year (n=28) sample using the
specification of rows 1 and 2, however, a different picture emerges. Figure 2

plots this series.

Although these coefficients abstract from changes due to

changes in tax rates, they still exhibit considerable movement. In particular,
the sharp jump in the series after the 1952 and 1953 observations are eliminated

and the early 1970s observations are added to the rolling sample, the downward

drift as the sample leaves the 1950s and enters the 1970s, the rise as the

sample moves into the second half of the 1970s, and the resumption of the
decline as the 1980s observations are included, suggests that major movements
are left to be explained.

2. Estimates based on Changing Policy Parameters

To estimate (8), allowing for variations in monetary and regulatory policy
as well as tax policy changes, we substitute (18) and (19) for a1 and a. Later

we wish to calculate the marginal significance levels of each explanatory
variable.

We require an estimate of the numerator of

significance level on M. To obtain a unique set of parameter estimates when

They are calculated as the square

root of the chi—square test statistic used to perform the likelihood ratio tests

of the restriction that each of the relevant coefficients was zero.8

The

general pattern of signs and significance of the coefficients in (35) mirrors

the OLS results of Table 1.

The coefficients of particular concern here,

however, are those associated with the regulatory and monetary policy parameters, s and e1.

The estimates of their coefficients are both positive and decisively signi-

ficant, indicating that the reduced form coefficients do in fact respond to
regime changes.

As e1 falls, i.e., as monetary policy becomes less accoin—

modative of real rate shocks, D falls.

The response of interest rates to

changes in the explanatory variables (except possibly for e) then rises, as the

economy is effectively operating with a steeper LM curve. As s rises, i.e., as
the share of liabilities which are unregulated rises, D falls, increasing all of

the reduced—form coefficients except that on e Due to the effect of s on the

numerator of , the increase in s (reduction in a1) will reduce the reduced—
form expected inflation coefficient. As fewer liabilities are regulated, market
interest rate increases induce less disintermediation and less credit rationing.

Less expenditure is deterred by given interest rate increases, generating an
effectively steeper IS curve, as hypothesized.

Adding D7983 to this specification (not shown) permits us to test whether
the reduced—form coefficient movement that we ascribe to policy shifts remains

when a dummy variable for the later part of the sample is included. The coef—

—19—

ficient estimate of 2.87 (t—statistic =

2.67) on D7983 does indicate that our

model still leaves an important part of the recent interest rate story to be
told. Our expanded specification has reduced the post—1979 dummy coefficient by

one—third, however, and the coefficients associated with e1 and s retain their
significance.

The summary statistics listed in Tables 1 and 2 suggest that allowing for
changing policy parameters improves the interest rate model. The standard error
of the estimate falls 24 and 30 percent for the short and long samples, respec—

tvely, when we incorporate policy—induced parameter movement. Likelihood ratio

tests more formally confirm the improvement.

The specification that jointly

restricts the a and a parameters to be constant and e to be zero in favor of
0

the expanded model that posits their movement according to (18)—(20) is rejected

at the 5 percent level. This is true for the shorter sample (1952:06—1979:06)

as well as for the sample that includes the post—1979 period, either with or
without the D7983 dummy. For the longer period, the data also decisively reject
the hypotheses that the coefficients associated with monetary policy and regula—

tory policy individually were zero.

Further, the expanded model is statisti-

cally superior in—sample to the model that includes D7983 but ignores regulatory

and monetary policy changes. Thus, in addition to producing reduced—form coefficients that move as our theory hypothesizes, allowing for structural change in
response to policy change produces a significantly improved specification.

Figure 3 plots the estimated time series values for , the reduced—form
coefficient for expected inflation implied by (36) and (37). The implied coef-

ficient exhibits a slight downward drift until the mid—1960s, due to a small
decline in the effective tax rate series. Tax schedule reductions in 1954 and
1964—65 and a slight cyclical response to economic slack in the late 1950s and

1970 with the higher e1 of the Burns regime. The large fall—off in

in 1979

Is associated with the dramatic decline in e1 attributed to the Voicker regime.

The sharp upward spikes in

reflect the disintermediation effects.

During

potential disinterinediation periods (when DCC takes on a nonzero value), the
interest sensitivity of expenditures (a1) and

rise. The magnitude of these

increases is related to the share of financial institutions' liabilities that
pay market—related interest rates (s).

As s increased over time, the size of

the spikes diminished. After the removal of interest ceilings on large CDs in
the early 1970s, the spikes become almost indistinguishable.

Though the two series are not directly comparable, the pattern in Figure 3
broadly mirrors the rolling sample estimates in Figure 2 (with the exception of
Figure 2's mid—sample spike). The implied time series of the other reduced—form

coefficients are proportional to (lID).

Given the form of the model and the

particular set of coefficient estimates, changes in a1 and e1 produce values for

these remaining reduced—form coefficients that move inversely to

Figure 3

and the mirror image of the movements of the other

reduced—form coefficients. Changes in t move all coefficients proportionately.

Ignoring regime changes may have been responsible for spuriously unstable
estimates over this period. Our model explains not only statistically significant movement of structural, and thus reduced—form, coefficients, but economically meaningful changes in those parameters. Stability tests conducted over a
mid—sample split using the constant policy parameter specification indicate that

specification Is unstable. By contrast, when we allow reduced—form parameters
to respond to regime changes, the resulting specification Is stable.8

Table 3 lists the actual values of interest rates and the values predicted

out—of—sample by row 1 and in—sample by rows 2 and 3 from Table 1 (constant
policy parameters) and Table 2 (variable policy parameters). The 1980:06 credit
control observation is omitted. The summary measures in Table 3 show that, out—

of—sample or in, the Table 2 equations outperform those from Table 1 over the
most recent period.9 The relative improvement appears to be approximately the
same for either in— or out—of—sample forecasts. In the out—of—sample case, the
mean error is reduced by (4.33—3.01=) 132 basis points (or 30 percent) and the
mean square error by 45 percent.

Fama and Gibbons (forthcoming) suggest that interest rate—based forecasts
may be better predictors of inflation than survey—based forecasts. To investigate the robustness of our findings, we have substituted a measure of expected

Inflation based on prior interest rates for the Livingston survey measure. We

generate these forecasts using only Information publicly available when the
interest rate was determined each period. The forecast during June depends on
the six, monthly—average Treasury bill yields from December to May and on the
forecast equation coefficients.

The coefficients are obtained by regressing

inflation on a constant and six lags of one—month Treasury yields over the
forty—eight months ending two months before the forecast is made. Using coefficient estimates from a sample that edged closer to the forecast dates (June

and December) would require more information than agents actually had. Using
these expected inflation proxies, likelihood ratio tests of the hypotheses that

the coefficients on the regulatory regime measures and the coefficient on the
monetary regime proxy are zero are rejected for both the pre—1979 and the longer

sample period.

Thus our finding that the reduced—form coefficients respond

systematically to government policy parameter shifts is further substantiated.

E. Concluding Remarks
There is considerable intertemporal instability in previous interest rate
equation estimates. We hypothesize that major fiscal, monetary, and regulatory

policy parameter shifts have been important sources of that instability.

We

embed estimates of the time series values of these policy parameters in our
model and estimate the deeper, more stable, underlying parameters. The estimates generate reduced—form coefficients that move by sizeable amounts in response

to policy parameter change.

Statistical tests imply that allowing for varying

policy parameters provides a significantly better explanation of interest rates.

These explainable movements in the reduced—form coefficients correspond rather
closely to the heretofore unexplained movements in the rolling sample estimates

obtained from the constant policy parameter model.

The variable policy para-

meter model passes the test of stability that the model which ignores regime
switches cannot.
