We consider the chosen means of exchange when both monetary and non-monetary exchange mechanisms are available.  We illustrate three potential reasons for the emergence of non-monetary trade.  First, a willingness to barter may reveal information that cannot be revealed solely through monetary trade.  Second, non-monetary trade may constrain the ability of agents to engage in inefficient rent-seeking activities.  Finally, non-monetary trade improves the ability of agents to impose trade sanctions on those who act dishonestly.  We consider a number of applications of each of these ideas.\n\n",
