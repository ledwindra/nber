The Role of Transportation Speed in Facilitating High Skilled Teamwork

NBER Working Paper No. 24539
April 2018
JEL No. O15,O31,R4
ABSTRACT
High skilled workers gain from face to face interactions. If the skilled can move at higher speeds,
then knowledge diffusion and idea spillovers are likely to reach greater distances. This paper
uses the construction of China’s high speed rail (HSR) network as a natural experiment to test
this claim. HSR connects major cities, that feature the nation’s best universities, to secondary
cities. Since bullet trains reduce cross-city commute times, they reduce the cost of face-to-face
interactions between skilled workers who work in different cities. Using a data base listing
research paper publication and citations, we document a complementarity effect between
knowledge production and the transportation network. Co-authors’ productivity rises and more
new co-author pairs emerge when secondary cities are connected by bullet train to China’s major
cities.

1. Introduction
Worker productivity is higher in high human capital cities (Moretti 2004, Rauch 1991).
These cities offer greater learning opportunities but the knowledge spillovers are localized
(Glaeser and Mare 2001, Rosenthal and Strange 2003, 2004). The localization of spillovers
emerges in an economy where low transportation speeds limits who can interact with whom.
The most productive and ambitious workers often migrate to major cities and then
become even more productive through interactions and learning. This dynamic is playing out
now in China. In China today, basic research takes place at the major universities that are
disproportionately concentrated in a small number of major cities (Figure 1-A). 1 If cross-city
transportation costs are high, researchers working in secondary cities will have fewer
opportunities to visit major cities and to interact with leading researchers there. Transportation
costs limit the ability of a talented professor at a top university to work with researchers with
complementary skills who works in another city.
This paper uses China’s recent investment in the creation of the high speed rail (HSR)
network as a natural experiment to test for the role of cross-city transportation speed as a key
determinant of urban productivity. We study whether reductions in cross-city transportation
costs facilitate matching and interactions between scientists. This process results in more
research ideas and higher quality research ideas. The academic production process creates
published papers and yields research citations. This output offers us quantitative metrics for
measuring the economic geography of productivity dynamics and for identifying cross-city flows

than two top universities.

of ideas and teamwork (Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Henderson 1993, Henderson, Jaffe and
Trajtenberg 1998). While our empirics focus on university researcher knowledge creation, we
posit that cross-city transportation speed also facilitates private sector R&D as firms that site
their labs in different locations can more frequently meet. 2
China’s HSR allows individuals to move across cities at speeds of roughly 175 miles per
hour. Such increased speed (a doubling of past train speeds) increases the menu of locations that
have access to mega cities. By the end of 2020, the HSR network will connect 113 Chinese cities
with population greater than one million. These trains offer a high quality comfortable ride and
greatly reduce the travel time of commuting across cities. There are many pairs of cities such as
Beijing and Shijiazhuang, Shanghai and Hefei, that are too far apart to drive and too close to fly.
Below, we will explicitly test for whether HSR is associated with a larger increase in trade in
ideas between these cities.
Using a data set of academic publications in the Web of Science (WoS, run by Thomson
Reuters), we document that researchers working in second tier cities enjoy a productivity boost
when their city is HSR-connected with the major cities. With increased travel speeds, individual
researchers in HSR connected secondary cities can visit top universities in mega cities more
frequently, listening to lectures and attending conferences. Such spillover effects may directly
improve their productivity by facilitating the learning process. Furthermore, in this age of
specialized knowledge production, complex research tasks need to be completed by a team
composed of individuals with complementary skills. Of all the papers in our data set, 97% are
co-authored.

Chinese patent citation data is publicly unavailable, which makes it difficult to test similar mechanisms in the
private sector.

3

We explore the matching and interaction of research teams. We test three possible
channels through which the HSR could cause a growth in researcher productivity. First, existing
pairs of co-authors located in two bullet train connected cities might interact more (“the intensive
margin”). Second, new matches might now take place because the bullet train increases the
interactions between scientists in these two cities (“the extensive margin”). This mechanism
builds on the claim that information technology is a complement for urbanization (Gaspar and
Glaeser 1998). They document that information technology accelerates the speed that ideas flow
across cities. In our case, the bullet train increases the speed that people move across cities. If
face-to-face interaction did not matter in the scientific idea creation process, then the bullet train
would have little marginal value added in an economy featuring widespread information
technology access.
The third channel focuses on the locational choice of scholars. Once cities are connected
to the HSR network, these secondary cities become more attractive locations for young scholars
because of their cheaper living cost and greater access to the mega city scholars. Such rising
scholars can now more easily visit the mega city to attend conferences, and network with the big
city star scientists.
We recognize that the Chinese central government is unlikely to randomly choose which
cities to connect by high speed rail. To address this concern, we implement an instrumental
variables (IV) regression approach and compare these results to the results based on ordinary
least squares (OLS) regressions. This endogeneity issue is less of a concern for our city-pair
analysis because cities are not connected by the bullet train to achieve the goal of promoting
more cross-city research collaboration.

4

We find that after a city is connected by high speed rail, the city’s academics production
of academic papers increases on average by 30.1% in quantity (# of papers) and by 30.9 % in
quality (impact-factor weighted # of papers) in the following years. At the city-pair level, higher
travel speed facilitates matching and idea flows between two HSR-connected cities. We estimate
that there are larger productivity gains for the subset of secondary cities most likely to gain the
most from HSR. These are cities too close to the major cities for there to be active air travel but
too far from the big cities to facilitate short vehicle rides. It is this subset of cities that would be
expected to gain the most from the HSR.
Our finding that HSR connections increase cross-city trade in ideas and research
partnerships has implications for the urban growth and human capital literature. Rauch (1991)
and Glaeser et. al. (1995) have implicitly assumed that human capital spillovers benefit the
geographic area in question (such as the metro area or county) but do not spillover across
geographic units. In contrast, our study highlights that the extent of the interaction across
geographic boundaries is related to travel speeds. As travel speeds increase (and the cost of
cross-city interactions decline), the stock of human capital in one area may increase economic
growth in HSR connected cities that now have greater “labor market access”. In this sense, our
paper contributes to the market potential literature (Harris 1954, Hanson 2005). The past market
potential literature has emphasized the earnings possibilities for a geographic area increases as a
function of its proximity to populations with high incomes (consumers). In our setting, the
productivity of scientists in smaller cities increases as their “proximity” to major cities in China
increases.

5

Our findings also have implications for cross-city inequality across China. Since more
people living in HSR connected secondary cities directly benefit from greater access to the
superstar researchers in the small number of mega cities, high speed rail effectively reduces the
sharp human capital inequality across cities and contributes to urban economic growth in the 2nd
tier cities.
Our study builds on previous research investigating the consequences of HSR for
different aspects of the Chinese economy. Zheng and Kahn (2013) document that this transport
innovation is associated with rising real estate prices in the nearby secondary cities. Lin (2017)
reports that an HSR connection increases the city’s passenger flows by 10% and employment by
7%. Industries with a greater reliance on non-routine cognitive skills benefit more from HSRinduced market access to other cities.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present our conceptual framework in
Section 2. Section 3 discusses the economic geography of China cities, the spatial distribution of
research productivity and the high speed rail system’s development. Section 4 presents our
empirical models and results.

2. Travel Speed and Knowledge Creation
Given the specialized nature of knowledge creation, many research teams engage in
complex tasks completed by individuals with complementary skills. If knowledge is produced
by scientists employed by for-profit firms, then the firm will locate its scientists efficiently
because all of the spillovers are internalized within the firm (Rossi-Hansberg and Sarte 2009). In

6

cases where there are cross firm spillovers, then firms will co-agglomerate in close physical
proximity (Arzaghi and Henderson, 2008).
Within a university, the spatial proximity of various researchers facilitates learning and
spillover effects (Claudel, et. al., 2017). A major city will be the home to many universities so
the local matching pool is larger. However, in this age of specialized research, even for the major
cities with thousands of researchers, the gains to trade knowledge may not be exhausted. In this
sense, transportation costs between cities limit the ability of research teams to effectively work
together, and the marginal benefits of connections to more scholars in other cities could be large.
Although researchers can discuss ideas via email and Skype, such information technologies are
not a perfect substitute for face to face interactions for these high-skilled workers (Catalini,
Fons-Rosen and Gaule, 2016).
High speed rail increases the travel speed across cities, and thus creates a larger local
market for highly productive workers. Starting with the work of Mortenson and Pissarides
(1999), labor economists have modeled the search process such that workers and firms are
matched through a matching function. The extent of the creation of new hires is a function of the
count of people seeking a job and the count of posted jobs and a stochastic process determining
how quickly they are matched. The matching possibilities in a city are a local public good that
all entrants enjoy (Helsley and Strange,1990). Low transportation speeds limit the entry of
individuals from other cities to enjoy these local public goods.
In the formation of new research teams, scientists who seek to co-author with other
scientists face a search process for meeting and interacting. Major academic conferences in large
cities can solve this co-ordination issue. In this case, new research teams may form due to better
7

matching of researchers with complementary skills in a larger academic labor market. Such
matching is facilitated by the increased cross-city travel speed. We call this channel the
“extensive margin”.
There is also an “intensive margin”. For those research teams that have already formed,
high speed rail reduces the price of face to face interaction. This encourages such teams to work
together more and perhaps to invest in pair specific human capital because they expect to interact
more often in the future. If scientists scattered across universities in different cities can easily
meet and interact with each other, then aggregate productivity increases.
Scholars can move across cities and universities. New Ph.D. graduates will choose which
city to start their academic career, and senior researchers may change their job and move to other
cities. The increase in cross-city transportation speed expands the “menu” of cities that
researchers can consider when searching for a job. This will influence human capital investment
strategies given the uncertainty in researchers’ future locations. Suppose a superstar researcher is
training a new set of PhD students. She will make more matched specific investments in these
young scholars’ skills if she knows her students will continue to work with her in the future.
Young researchers will be more likely to invest in relationship specific human capital if they
anticipate that they will have easy access to the superstar researcher in the future (Azoulay,
Graff-Zivin and Wang, 2010). This channel highlights the complementarity between specific
skill development and the extent of the market.
2.1 Testing for the Productivity Effects of Increased Cross-City Travel Speeds
Our empirical work features three different units of analysis: the city, the city-pair, and
the researcher level. At the city level, we examine whether the HSR connection increases a
8

city’s academic productivity. We construct two instrumental variables to address the possible
endogeneity in HSR placement (see Section 4.2). The rise in a city’s academic productivity may
come from better matching and interactions between scientists in connected cities (knowledge
trade), or from individual scientists’ learning process facilitated by easier and more frequent
travels to great conferences (knowledge spillover). We are not able to disentangle these two
sources. Nevertheless, in this age of specialized knowledge production and the prevalence of
teamwork in the academia (97% of the papers in our data set are co-authored papers), better
matching and interactions may be the dominant mechanisms here.
After establishing that HSR-connected cities do enjoy an increased research productivity,
we then test several plausible mechanisms at the city-pair level and at the researcher level. Citypair level models are estimated to study idea flows across cities. For example, one city-pair is
Beijing and Tianjin. Such idea flows represent a cross-city trade of knowledge. The HSR
facilitates this knowledge trade. The co-authorship structure in our journal paper data set
provides us with the opportunity to track such idea flows.
Throughout this paper, we define treatment as representing whether a city is connected to
the HSR network, or whether two specific cities are HSR connected. We test whether treatment
is associated with an increase in the quantity and quality of co-authored papers written by
scientists located in HSR-connected cities. We then restrict our sample to “non-movers”
(scientists who continue to live in the same city after its connection to the HSR network) to
highlight that high speed rail facilitates inter-city matching and interactions without requiring an
influx of new scholars. We also document evidence of the role of both the extensive and
intensive margins by splitting our researcher sample into “first-time co-authors” and “incumbent
9

co-authors”. Travel time should matter here –those city pairs with the distance within HSR’s
comparative advantage (i.e., within a three-hour travel time) should experience larger gains.
At the researcher level, we focus on a subset of “movers” (scientists who move to another
city during our study period). For each researcher in our sample who has moved across cities,
we know her origination city and destination city. We use a conditional logit model of locational
choice to explore whether she is more likely to move to cities with an HSR connection. Each
scholar faces a tradeoff. The mega cities with top universities have excellent academic resources
and a large pool of star scholars, but living costs (e.g. home prices) there are extremely high
(Zheng et. al. 2016). After being connected by HSR, those secondary cities with a reasonable
commute time to the major cities may gain by attracting more researchers to live there.

3. The Geography of Research Productivity and the High Speed Railway
3.1 Knowledge Production in Chinese Universities
China started to build its modern universities in the late Qing Dynasty (around 1890).
Peking University and Tsinghua University were founded in 1898 and 1911, respectively. The
elite universities were founded in major cities and have received state investment during the
Republic of China era, and later from the Chinese Communist Party starting in 1949. As of 2016,
there are 803 universities in China and 98% of them are public universities. This system is quite
hierarchical. At the top, there are 39 first-tier universities that receive favorable research and

10

teaching funds from the State (called the “top universities” thereafter). 3 They have excellent
laboratories, libraries and databases and attract the best scholars and talented students. This
human capital agglomeration process reinforces itself.
China has 287 prefecture-level cities, but 60% of the top universities in China are
concentrated in nine major cities. 4 In China, the best universities are disproportionately
concentrated in a small number of mega cities (Figure 1-A). Beijing, Shanghai, Changsha,
Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Tianjin, Chengdu and Xi’an, all have more than two top
universities, and together they account for 64% of all top universities. Beijing has eight top
universities, and Shanghai has four . On the other end of the spectrum, almost 100 cities (most
are small cities) have no universities. The medium sized cities feature the largest count of
average quality universities. Such a spatial concentration of top universities generates a clear
disparity in academic productivity across Chinese cities. To develop world-class universities, the
Chinese government allocates most funding to a few elite universities which house the most
productive researchers and the most advanced laboratories (Freeman and Huang 2015). During
the years 2006-2016, more than half of peer-reviewed international journal papers were produced
by scholars at the universities in the aforementioned nine mega cities (Figure 1-B).
To measure academic productivity, we collect all of the international journal publications
from Chinese universities during the years 2001 to 2016 (featuring at least one author from
Mainland China) from the database of "Web of Science". To increase the international visibility
of Chinese research, the number and quality of WoS papers have been widely used by the

3

These universities are included in the “985 Program”. This Program is a constructive project for founding world-class
universities in the 21st century conducted by the government of the People’s Republic of China on May 4 1998. In the initial
phase, 9 universities were included in the project. The second phase, launched in 2004, expanded the program until it has now
reached 39 universities.
11

Chinese government to evaluate the research performance since late 1990s. Chinese scholars are
required to publish WoS papers to be promoted, while their affiliated universities need WoS
papers to rise in the rankings and to increase their funding from the government. Universities
offer preferential policies and monetary rewards to encourage their scholars to publish in the
WoS-indexed journals with high impact factors (Quan, et. al., 2017). Such policies provide a
further incentive for researchers to work with stars at elite universities.
For each paper, we obtain the paper’s title, the names and affiliations of the authors, the
publication date, journal field, journal impact factor, and the citation count (as of December
2016). 5 Our final data set includes roughly 1.5 million journal papers. Figure 1-B shows that
these papers are disproportionally authored by researchers who are concentrated in a few mega
cities where the top universities are located.
We construct both quantity and quality measures for academic papers. We count the
number of papers as the quantity measure. To measure quality, we create two indicators–the
journal impact factor weighted number of papers (as a measure of how many papers are
published in impactful journals) and the citation weighted number of papers (as a measure of
how impactful the papers are). Both indicators yield very consistent and similar results. We will
mainly report the results using the first indicator.
The importance of face-to-face interaction and the publication cycle vary across fields.
Using each journal’s academic field information in the “Web of Science” database, we classify
all papers into five fields:(1) Arts& Humanities; (2) Social Science; (3) Life Sciences and

5

For the author records with the same first name, last name and affiliation, we assume they are written by the same
person. Miscoding may occur when two scholars at one affiliation have exactly the same first name and last name,
but such cases should be very rare.

12

Biomedicine; (4) Physical Sciences; and (5) Technology. In our regressions, we control for city
fixed effects and field fixed effects. When testing for the heterogeneous effect of high speed rail
connection on academic publication, we combine (1) and (2) into a broad category of social
science, and (3), (4) and (5) into a broad category of science and technology. We expect that
researchers in the social sciences may benefit more from increased travel speeds across cities
because social scientists spend less time in labs but more time in face-to-face discussions.
3.2 The Economic Geography of the High Speed Rail Routes
The HSR network information is collected from the official website (www.12306.cn) of
the National Railway Administration of the People Republic of China (see Figure 2). On this
website, we identify whether and when a city is connected by HSR, and also calculate the travel
time between any two cities (by HSR or regular train). The “CONNECT” dummy equals one
once a city is connected by HSR, or once the two cities in a city-pair are connected by HSR. We
then construct a city-city matrix including all cities with at least one co-publication where in
each cell we have the travel time between these two cities by train. This cross-city travel time
shrinks after the two cities are connected by HSR.
Given that a city’s HSR treatment status is not randomly assigned, we must address the
site selection issue. If the local governments in second-tier Chinese cities anticipate that there are
beneficial synergies between their ordinary universities and easier access to the mega cities, then
the leaders will invest more in the local universities in those newly HSR connected secondary
cities.

Such a complementarity between public infrastructure (high speed rail) and university

investment would lead the econometrician to over-estimate the role of HSR alone. We note that
if we seek to estimate HSR’s “total effect” on research productivity then OLS estimates yield the
13

right answer. In this case, we would be assuming that all of the new investment by universities
was caused by the construction of the HSR. To test this complementary investment hypothesis,
we collect the amount of investment in each university by year using data from the China
Education Statistical Yearbook and other sources. We do not observe significant increases in the
research funding after HSR connection (See Appendix 3). But our investment variable might not
capture all the resources city leaders put on the universities in their jurisdiction.
In the second case, investments in universities and cities are correlated with HSR
connection but not caused by it. For instance, booming cities have a rising demand for
transportation so that the central government places HSR stations there, and at the same time
those cities have a greater fiscal capacity to invest in universities and other infrastructure. Or the
State chooses to connect the weak cities into the HSR network to help them to grow, but the
investment on universities there still lags behind.
We employ an instrumental variables approach to address this omitted variables concern.
We seek city level instrumental variables that are correlated with the likelihood that a city is
connected by HSR but that are unlikely to be correlated with the unobserved determinants of a
city’s academic output. Following the transportation economics literature, we construct two
instrumental variables for the city level analysis. The first one (𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖i ) is based on the nation’s
historical railway network (Baum-Snow et. al. 2017; Zheng and Kahn 2013), and the second one
(𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_military𝑖𝑖 ) is based on the spatial distribution of major military troop deployments in 2005

14

(Zheng and Kahn 2013). One purpose for China’s central government to build high speed rail
network is to ship troops in case of emergency. 6
The endogeneity issue is a lesser concern for the city-pair analysis. It is not plausible that
cities are connected by the bullet train because of the goal of promoting more cross-city research
collaboration. Therefore, we employ the IV estimator in the city-level analysis but not in the
city-pair level analysis.
3.3 Descriptive Evidence on Team Production and Cross-City Travel Speed
97% of the papers in our data set are co-authored papers. Co-authoring represents team
production of knowledge. Each research partner must volunteer to join the team and thus must
receive some benefits from the participation. Face-to-face interactions are crucial for the
knowledge flows and diffusion between coauthors. That is why in this modern era with advanced
online communication technologies (Email, Skype, mobile phone, etc.), scholars are still willing
to attend conferences and seminars to present their research work, and interact with other
scholars. High speed rail causes a large decline in transportation costs and thus facilitates faceto-face communications between coauthors.
We take advantage of this co-authorship structure to examine the idea flows before and
after the introduction of HSR. For papers with multiple authors, we work with the first three
authors, and their corresponding affiliations and cities 7. We then construct one-to-one author

In Chinese universities, the order of authors is very important for judging a specific author’s contribution to the
paper. This information is used for promotion and performance evaluation purposes.

15

pairs between the coauthors. For instance, if a paper has two coauthors: A and B, then we will
construct one coauthor pair A-B. If another paper has three coauthors: C, D and E, then we will
construct three co-author pairs: C-D, C-E, and D-E. Since we know the city name each author
was working in when publishing this paper, we count the number of paper publications (or
weighted by impact factor, citation count) for each city-pair by year. Figure 2 shows the spatial
distribution of the co-publications between cities. Mega cities with top universities represent the
cores in the co-authorship rays.
*** Insert Figure 2 about here ***
We seek to identify whether an author in our data set is a “mover” (who moves to another
city in our study period) or a “non-mover” (who continues to live in the city). CV information is
publicly unavailable for most of the researchers in our data set, so we have to rely on the
affiliation information in their papers. For an author who appears more than once in our
database, we check if his/her affiliation has changed in our study period – if yes, he/she is
defined as a “mover”, otherwise a “non-mover”. 8 For those authors who only published one
paper (accounting for 36% of all authors in our data set during our whole study period), we are
unable to tell whether they are mover or non-mover. Our labels of movers and non-movers are
“narrowly-defined” and they only apply to a subset of authors with multiple publications. For coauthor pairs, we define this pair as a non-mover pair only if both authors in a pair did not move
in our study period. When we use the author-level data to explore moved researchers’ location

8

We do not observe the migration of a new researcher before she publishes her first paper.

16

choices, we only track the affiliation change of each paper’s first author to construct the
subsample of moved researchers.
We collect additional time varying city variables as controls. The main data source is the
China City Statistical Yearbook covering the years 2004 to 2016. We collect data on the
passenger volumes in both airport and highway for each city to control for other transportation
modes. The total population and GDP per capita are also included as controls.
Table 1 provides the summary statistics of the key variables, for both city level and citypair level.

4. Empirical Models and Results
At the city-level and city-pair level, we employ fixed effects and instrumental variable
estimation techniques to measure the association between HSR connection and the quantity and
quality of cross-city research scholarship. Then we employ a conditional logit model to explore
a moved researcher’ city choice.
4.1 Growth in city research productivity
At the city level, we examine the relationship between the academic productivity measure
Y in city i in field s in year t (Yist, representing either research quantity or quality measure) and
the city’s status in the HSR network –the year which the city was firstly connected by the bullet

17

train network (with at least one high speed railway station) (connectit). Our benchmark fixed
effects specification is:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡0 + 𝛽𝛽 ′ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 + 𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(1)

Where Xit are time-variant controls for city i.𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is either the number of papers (papers),

or the number of impact factor-weighted papers (weighted_papers)in city i in field s in year t for
the quantitative and qualitative analyses, respectively. We include city fixed effects(𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 ), year

fixed effects(𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 ) , and field fixed effects (𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠 ), which account for many omitted variables and
some sources of endogeneity. For example, cities with a strong industrial base may be more

likely to have a HSR connection, and at the same time they may also have good universities in
the engineering field and thus produce more papers in that field. To account for serial
correlation, standard errors are clustered at province level.
We expect that when a city is connected by bullet train (the connect dummy turns on), it
will enjoy a significant increase in academic productivity Y. Since the academic publication
review process takes time, we introduce a lagged term for connect (the lag period is t0).
Table 2 reports the effects of HSR connection on the academic productivity at city level,
based on a panel data set. Panel A of Table 2 presents OLS regressions of equation (1). The
dependent variable is log of the (1+count of papers) or the log of (1+quality weighted papers). 9
Column (1) and column (2) present the OLS regressions based on the full sample. The number of
papers and impact factor weighted papers for cities after the HSR connection increases by 7.8%
and 6.3%, respectively, although the latter estimate is statistically insignificant.

9

The regression controls include the GDP per capita, population, airport ridership, and highway ridership. Standard errors are

clustered by province level, and we also include city fixed effects, field fixed effects and year dummies.

18

*** Insert Table 2 about here ***
There are two possible reasons for this insignificant effect. First, 38% of the observations
have the value of zero publication. Although we add one to the number of publications and then
take logarithm, the distribution of this dependent variable is still far from being normally
distributed. Second, as discussed above, there may be endogeneity issue between a city’s academic
productivity and its probability of HSR connection.
We employ zero-inflated negative binomial regression technique to address the first issue
(see panel B).The coefficients of connect_1 is statistically significant with a value of 0.339. This
indicates that the HSR connection is associated with a 40% increase in the quantity of
publications in a city (e0.339 − 1). Column (2) shows that this increase is 36% for quality-

weighted papers. We now restrict our sample to the “narrowly-defined” non-movers, and the
effect of bullet train connection is larger for the paper quality improvement for this subgroup in
Panel B. Note that such effects include both the benefit from knowledge trade (generated by
interactions between researchers) and knowledge spillovers (received by individual researchers)
brought by the HSR connection. In Appendix 2 we report the regressions of equation (1) with the
current year or 2-year lag HSR connection indicators. The results are similar with those in Table
2.
The effect of HSR connection differ by discipline. Social science is expected to rely more
on face-to-face communication. We report the results for publication quality by discipline in
column (5) and (6). As expected, the HSR effect is statistically significant for both disciplines but
it is slightly larger for social science papers.

We now employ the IV estimator. Since our two instruments are time-invariant, we are
unable to run the IV regression using the panel data set. Instead, we estimate the following longdifference equation over the years 2006 to 2015:
log(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2015 ) − log(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2006 )

Where 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2015 ) − 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2006 ) measures the growth rate in the number of papers

(papers), the number of impact factor-weighted papers (weighted_papers)in field s in city i of
province p during 2006 to 2015. 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2006−2015 equals one if this city is connected by HSR
during this study period. Time-varying city attributes (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ) are also first-differenced. Field fixed
effects (𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠 ) and province fixed effects(𝜇𝜇𝑝𝑝 )are included. Following Agrawal et. al.(2017) and

Faber(2014), we also control for the research productivity in the initial year (𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2006 ), and a set of

variables measuring pre-existing demographic, economic and political conditions of city i

(𝑋𝑋′𝑖𝑖,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝−𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 ). The identifying assumption is that our two instrument variables affect changes
in academic productivity only through HSR connections, conditional on all the controls we include
in Equation (2).
Table 3 presents both OLS and IV regression results based on the long difference equation
(2). Column (1) and (2) are for all cities. The OLS coefficients in Panel A are still insignificant,
but the IV regressions in Panel B yield significantly positive effects of HSR connection on the
city’s academic productivity. HSR connection is associated with around a 30% increase in both
publication quantity and quality. This magnitude is quite similar to the zero-inflated negative
binomial regressions reported in Table 2. Such effects are even larger for non-movers. Columns
20

(5) to (8) illustrate that scholars in social science benefit more from this new transportation
technology than those in science and technology.

4.2 HSR Boosts Productivity at the Intensive Margin
We take advantage of the pair structure of the coauthored papers to examine the idea
flows between cities. In this section, our unit of analysis is the city-pair by year. We count the
number (or the quality-adjusted number) of publications for the co-author pairs in city i and city j
(for each pair, one author in city i, and the other in city j)in year t (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 ), and estimate:
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾1 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−𝑡𝑡0 + 𝜌𝜌′𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(3)

In equation (3) Xijt are time-varying controls for city i and j in year t. We include year
fixed effects (𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 ), and city pair fixed effects (𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) which account for time-invariant omitted
variables for these two cities, and standard errors are clustered at the province pair level.

𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−𝑡𝑡0 measures whether the city pair was first connected by the bullet train (with at least

one bullet train connecting two cities directly) in this year.

Table 4 presents the city-pair results. The dependent variable is impact factor-weighted
papers. Panel A and B show the results of OLS and Zero-inflated binomial regression (ZINB)
results, respectively. In column (1) for all city-pairs, for the ZINB specifications, HSR
connection (with one year lag) has significantly positive effect on the coauthored papers between
HSR-connected city pairs.
As discussed in Section 2, it is possible that when cities are connected by HSR, scholars
will permanently move to other cities (we will explicitly test this in section 4.3). An important
21

channel we want to highlight here is that the HSR effect also exists for those who do not choose
to move (Agrawal, Galasso and Oettl, 2017). Our results are robust when focusing on a subsample of “narrowly-defined” non-movers, whose affiliations do not change during our study
period (column (2)). This reinforces our view that bullet trains facilitate the circulation of ideas
even in the absence of scholar migration.
*** Insert Table 4 about here ***
Secondary cities may benefit more when they are connected to a mega city featuring
brilliant scholars and advanced labs at the leading universities. In columns (3) - (5) we explore
the heterogeneous effect of HSR connection on three different types of city pairs: mega city secondary city, secondary city with secondary city, mega city with mega city. The subgroup of
mega and secondary city pairs receives the largest benefit from bullet train connection. The
connection between two mega cities creates little effect, perhaps because they have already been
well connected by other transportation networks like airline and highway and had intensive
academic interactions.
In Table 5 we decompose the effect between pairs of scholars who collaborate both
before and after HSR connection (the intensive margin pairs) versus pairs of scholars who
collaborate after the connection (the extensive margin pairs). We find a stronger effect for
intensive margin pairs (column (1) and (2)), consistent with the idea that even a few, additional
face-to-face communications could have a tangible impact on the rate of academic collaboration.
At the same time, the HSR connection also enables experimentation in the form of new
collaborations of academics in different cites (column (3) and (4)), but this extensive margin is
smaller than the intensive margin.
22

*** Insert Table 5 about here ***
HSR enables scholars to move faster across space. The HSR service has a comparative
advantage over air travel for journeys of up to three hours or 750 km. 10 Here we test whether
those cities located in this travel time “sweet spot” to mega cities benefit more from the
intellectual spillovers. Those secondary cities become “closer” (measured in travel time) to the
mega cities because bullet trains connect them. We construct a set of dummies to measure a
city’s travel time by train to the closest mega-city. 11 Table 6 shows that this publication premium
due to the HSR connection exhibits a clear decay pattern as the secondary city is further away
from the mega city. The premium is the largest for secondary cities within a 1.5-hour travel
distance, followed by those in a 1.5-hour to 3-hour travel distance, and lose its significance for
the cities outside the 3-hour radius.

4.3 Researcher Migration Patterns
We focus on a subsample of researchers who have migrated and track which cities they
move to. This subsample has 58,460 movers and each of them face a choice set of 286
prefecture-level cities (all 287 prefecture-level cities minus the origination city), so the expanded
sample size is huge. We randomly pick up a 1% subsample to run a conditional logit model. Let
𝑠𝑠 = 1,2, … , 𝑁𝑁 denote moved researchers, 𝑖𝑖 = 1,2, … , 𝐼𝐼denote researcher k’s origination city, and
𝑗𝑗 = 1,2 … ,287denote the choice set of destination cities (including all 287 prefecture-level

10

According to the World Bank Working Paper “High-Speed Rail: The Fast Track to Economic Development?”
(No. 55856), a high-speed rail service has a time advantage over air travel for journeys of up to three hours or 750
km. For short journeys, up to 100 km, the private vehicle is the bullet train’s main competitor.

For each city, we identify its closest mega cities by its distance using ArcGIS. Here, travel time=Min(travel time
by ordinary train, travel time by bullet train)

cities). We estimate the conditional logit model based on the utility function presented in
equation (4):
2
𝑈𝑈𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ∗ = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
+ 𝛽𝛽3 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 (4)

In equation (4) 𝑈𝑈𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ∗ is the latent variable of researcher k’s utility from moving from city i

to j. This researcher will compare her utility from each possible destination and select the utilitymaximizing choice. 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 measures the travel distance by ordinary train between city 𝑖𝑖 and

city 𝑗𝑗. 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗 is a dummy indicator of whether city j is a mega city. 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻_𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗 is a dummy of
whether city 𝑗𝑗 has been connected to a mega city by direct bullet train in the year that this

researcher makes the decision to move. We also control for city j’s population size. We estimate
this conditional logit model for the 1% sample, and then by two sub-groups – highly productive
researchers, and others (impact factor weighted number of publications above or below the
sample’s median value).
Table 7 presents the estimation results. The likelihood of migrating decreases nonlinearly
with respect to the travel distance between origination city and the destination city (column (1)).
Researchers do favor mega cities. Controlling for travel distance and whether the destination is a
mega city, they also have a strong preference of moving to the secondary cities that are directly
connected to mega cities by HSR (the default group includes other cities). In column (2), we
further control for city size, and the patterns are similar. Using the two coefficients of HSR_mega
and log(pop), our calculation shows that the “attractiveness” a secondary city gains after being
connected by high speed rail is equivalent to a population growth by 80%. We then divide this
sample into highly productive researchers and other researchers (column (3) and (4)). Comparing
the two marginal effects of mega and HSR_mega, we see that high-productively researchers have
24

a slightly higher probability of moving to mega cities. This is suggestive evidence of researchers’
sorting. HSR-connected secondary cities provide a new choice for the researchers who have
chosen not to move to mega cities but still want to access the star researchers there.

5. Conclusion
In the classic monocentric model, increases in within-city travel speeds lower real estate
prices at the center and cause the city to spread out further into the suburban fringe (Wheaton
1977). Such within city speed facilitates increased trade, matching and learning (Prud'homme
and Lee 1999). Singapore's adoption of road pricing is an example of a policy that increases
such speeds.
In the classic Roback (1982) system of cities model, migration costs are assumed to be
zero but workers do not have the option of working in one city and living in another city.
However, this might be a very attractive option to young people in cities featuring high
productivity and high housing prices. Increases in travel speeds across cities increases the set of
possible joint work and residential decisions.
In this paper we have studied a special segment of the labor market: academics in China.
Such scholars are footloose with flexible work schedules that allow them to travel to work face
to face with collaborators. Cross-city transportation time and financial costs limit the extent of
these possibilities.
This paper argues that China's investment in High Speed Rail creates an integrated,
regional system of cities close enough to travel by fast train but far enough to not be car
25

friendly.

We have studied the productivity impacts of cross-city transport improvements by

focusing on publication and citation patterns of China's university researchers.
The empirical results in this paper show that once a city is connected into the HSR
network, the researchers in that city will experience significant productivity increase in terms of
quantity and quality of journal publications. We find that travel speed facilitates matching and
idea flows between two HSR-connected cities. Larger productivity gains are observed for the
secondary cities close enough to the mega cities to access them by HSR. We find larger
productivity effects for social scientists and for the incumbent coauthors (the intensive margin).
For the subsample of migrants, we find that they are more likely to choose those secondary cities
that are directly connected with mega cities by HSR, compared to other secondary cities. These
empirical findings bolster our claim that cross-city speed facilitates learning and matching across
cities.
This finding has implications both for efficiency and for equity in the modern Chinese
economy. In a human capital based economy, high speed rail induced reductions in
transportation costs increase regional productivity by improving matching and lowering the cost
of face-to-face interaction. At the same time, in China where the best universities and most
productive people are concentrated in a handful of cities, there is the possibility of extreme
spatial income inequality. China’s richest cities are towards the east. Cities such as Beijing and
Shanghai are home to the nation’s most talented workers and most productive firms. These cities
feature very high pay and real estate prices. 12

12

While there is not complete free mobility in China, the loosening of the domestic passport system varies by city
type such that smaller cities are home to workers and firms with less human capital and lower overall productivity.
26

The Chinese Communist Party is deeply concerned about such inequality. The provision
of transportation infrastructure is one of the major policies that China’s central and local
governments implemented to spur regional economic growth through its effect on productivity,
employment and investment. We have argued that highly skilled researchers in secondary cities
in China become more productive and their partnerships with star scientists in mega cities yield a
greater quantity and quality of research as cross-city travel time declines . This flattening of the
hierarchy of human capital distribution in Chinese cities helps to promote both economic growth
and reduces within region human capital inequality. Therefore, our findings also have macroimplications for the long-run sustainability of China’s economic growth.
Our main finding that faster cross-city commuting speeds enhance productivity extends
the original Gaspar and Glaeser (1998) work in a new direction. They argue that cities and
information technology are complements and not substitutes. The benefits of face to face
interaction increase if strangers recognize that once they have met that they can subsequently
connect again by phone, Skype and email. Cities exist because they economize on transportation
costs. The boundary of a city’s agglomeration area is endogenous and hinges on transportation
speed. If new technologies such as high speed rail effectively make nearby cities “closer” to
superstar cities (through moving at a faster speed), then agglomeration benefits spread out further
across space.

Notes: All regressions include a constant. *, **,***: indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, 1% level. "connect_0615" indicates whether the city is
connected by HSR during 2006 and 2015. The dependent variable is change in the logarithm of “the count of papers (or the count of impact-factor weighted
papers) plus 1”, from 2006 to 2015. All regressions control for the initial value of the dependent variable in 2006, the growth of city GDP per capita, the growth
of city population, and a group of geographic and political characteristics (the city’s latitude and longitude, province capital dummy, historical colonial status
dummy). “Non-movers” are defined as those first authors who publish at least two papers in our study period and do not change the city they work in. "Social
Science" includes the fields of Arts & Humanities and Social Science, and "Science and Technology" includes the fields of Life Sciences and Biomedicine,

“hour” in column (1) and (2) measures the actual travel time by HSR between the city pair, and in column (3) and (4)
it measures the actual travel time by HSR to the closest mega city. Column (1) and (2) show the estimation result for
city-pair level analysis, and the default category is the city pairs with HSR travel time longer than 5 hours. Column
(3) and (4) are for city-level analysis. We only include secondary cities, and the default category is the secondary
cities with HSR travel time longer than 5 hours to its closest mega city. In column (3) and (4), "connect_mega" equals
1 after this city is connected to the closest mega city by HSR. The default category is the secondary cities with HSR
travel time to the closest mega city longer than 5 hours. "Mega cities" are defined as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing,

Appendix 1: The construction of the two instrumental variables for determining the HSR’s
placement

Following the transportation economics literature (Duranton and Turner 2012; Duranton
el al.,2014), the first instrument variable we use is based on the nation’s historical railway
network. Baum-Snow et al. (2017) rely on the Chinese railroad networks from 1962 as sources
of quasi-random variation in their regressions predicting roads’ effect on regional economic
growth. Zheng and Kahn (2013) also use China’s 1961 railway road map to construct an IV to
investigate HSR’s effect on housing prices. They collect information based on historical Chinese
railroad maps indicating whether the city had at least one station on the railway map (connected
by the train network) in 1961 (rail1961i). The second instrument variable we use is the spatial
distribution of major military troop deployments in 2005(militaryi). China's central government
built the network to ship non-war military troops and light equipment in case of emergency.
The validity of the instruments relies on the assumption that, conditional on controls,
factors that do not directly affect city academic performance determine both the instruments
distribution and current HSR network, and these factors are the only channel through which HSR
connection affects city research productivity. However, the exclusion restriction could be
violated if locations among the historical rail route in 1961 or the military deployment are
correlated with economic city characteristics due to history or geography. We therefore estimate
regressions including a set of additional controls that could be correlated with the instruments
while also affecting the bullet train connection.
