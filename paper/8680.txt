Corporate Governance and the Home Bias

ABSTRACT
In most countries, many of the largest corporations are controlled by large shareholders. We show
that, under reasonable assumptions, this stylized fact implies that portfolio holdings of U.S. investors
should exhibit a home bias in equilibrium. We construct an estimate of the world portfolio of shares
available to investors who are not controlling shareholders. This available world portfolio differs sharply
from the world market portfolio. In regressions explaining the portfolio weights of U.S. investors, the
world portfolio of available shares has a positive significant coefficient but the world market portfolio
has no additional explanatory power. This result holds when we control for country characteristics.

The home bias is perhaps the least controversial stylized fact in international finance. There is now
much evidence that investors overweight domestic stocks in their common stock portfolio. Excellent data
on stock ownership is available for the U.S. for 1997. U.S. investors have roughly 91% of their stock
investments in U.S. stocks, but U.S. stocks represent only 49% of the world market portfolio. If investors
minimize the variance of the real return of their portfolio subject to a constraint on the expected real return
of their portfolio, they should hold the world market portfolio of common stocks if the joint distribution of
real returns on securities is the same across investors. U.S. investors are not close to holding the world
market portfolio of common stocks.
Many authors have attempted to explain the home bias.1 Explanations proposed in the literature
include barriers to international investment, departures from purchasing power parity, information
asymmetries between domestic and foreign investors, hedging of human capital or other non-traded assets,
and over-optimism of domestic investors toward home assets. This vast literature has not succeeded in
providing a generally accepted explanation for the home bias.
In this paper, we show that another stylized fact in international finance has important implications
for estimates of the magnitude of the home bias. La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) establish
that firms outside the U.S. are typically controlled by a large shareholder. The large shareholder is most often
a family. In countries where controlling shareholders are economically important, we would expect to see
a large home bias in equity holdings since a large fraction of the outstanding shares will be held by local
controlling shareholders. However, less intuitively, we show that the economic importance of controlling
shareholders outside the U.S. helps explain the home bias of U.S. investors.
The world market portfolio used as a benchmark for estimates of the extent of the home bias is
constructed assuming that all shares issued by a corporation could potentially be held by foreign investors.
This is not correct. If a firm has a controlling shareholder who holds 51% of the firm’s shares, only 49% of
1

the firm’s shares will be available for purchase by small shareholders. An increase in the demand for a firm’s
shares by small shareholders will not lead the controlling shareholder to lower his holdings to less than 50%
because in doing so he would lose the benefits from controlling the company. The controlling shareholder
is therefore only willing to sell his shares as a controlling block for a price significantly above the price at
which shares trade on the stock market – he demands a control premium to sell. Nenova (2000) and Dyck
and Zingales (2001) show that the benefits from control are substantial in most countries. We call portfolio
investors those investors whose return from shares consists only of dividends and price appreciation, so that
the shares these investors hold yield no private benefits from control for them. Shares held by investors who
are controlling shareholders or who belong to a coalition of shareholders who control the firm cannot be
bought by portfolio investors and therefore should not be included in the world market portfolio when
estimating the home bias of these investors.
We construct estimates of the fraction of the shares that are closely held for 51 countries in 1997.
Our estimate can also be thought of as measuring the float of shares in each market as a fraction of the
market’s capitalization, which would be one minus the fraction of closely-held shares. We define closely-held
shares to be those held by a stockholder with a block of shares that he would not sell without being paid a
premium to reflect the benefits he derives from control. We call such a shareholder a controlling shareholder.
We classify as controlling shareholders all shareholders who are known to hold more than 5% of a firm’s
shares. Our estimates can overstate the holdings of shares unavailable for stock market trading, since it may
well be that some of the large shareholders do not belong to a coalition of controlling shareholders and might
be willing to alter their holdings without receiving a control premium. Yet, it is also possible that our
estimates understate the holdings of shares unavailable for trading because many shareholders that may
belong to a control coalition hold too few shares to be included in the database we use. For instance, a firm
controlled by a coalition of shareholders where each shareholder in the coalition owns less than 5% of the
shares would be viewed as a firm with no controlling shareholder in our study. Across the 51 countries, the

2

average estimate is that 32% of the shares are not available for trading. However, there is substantial
variation across countries in the fraction of shares that can be held by portfolio investors. Not surprisingly,
the U.S. is the country where controlling shareholders are least important. In nine countries, tradeable shares
(i.e., float) represent less than half of the market’s total capitalization.
We show that, under some assumptions, portfolio investors hold the world market portfolio of
available shares. We construct an estimate of this portfolio, which we refer to as the world float portfolio.
The U.S. market weight in the world float portfolio is 58.32%, which is substantially higher than the 49.60%
weight in the world market portfolio. Consequently, portfolio investors should overweight the U.S. in their
holdings relative to the share of the U.S. in the world market portfolio. Controlling shareholders are typically
residents – the management team belongs to the coalition of controlling shareholders and has to be resident.
Since the stock market wealth of U.S. investors is estimated to be 101.53% of the capitalization of U.S.
equities and closely-held shares are estimated to represent 7.94% of U.S. equities, we expect U.S. investors
to hold at least 61.28% of their equities in U.S. shares.2 Taking into account the role of controlling
shareholders has the effect of increasing the share of the U.S. in the world portfolio of available shares,
thereby reducing (but not eliminating) the home bias of U.S. investors as traditionally measured.
We show that controlling shareholders directly affect the investment of U.S. shareholders in a
country. The share of a country’s equities in the stock portfolio of U.S. investors is negatively related to the
share of the stock market capitalization of the country held by large shareholders. The literature has
2

The Treasury reports that U.S. investors hold $1,207,787 million in foreign equities at the end
of 1997. The IFC reports the U.S. market capitalization to be $11,308,779 million. According to flow of
funds data, U.S. investors hold 90.85% of their stock market wealth in U.S. equities. Consequently, U.S.
investors’ holdings represent 101.53% of U.S. stock market capitalization. U.S. portfolio investors hold
all the stocks held by U.S. investors minus 7.94% of U.S. market capitalization representing closely-held
shares. This means that U.S. portfolio investors hold stocks worth $10,666,149 million, of which they put
58.32% in the world float portfolio assuming they hold that portfolio. Total U.S. equities held by U.S.
investors are therefore $10,666,149 x 0.5832 + $815,766 million, which corresponds to 62.22% of U.S.
stock market wealth if controlling shareholders hold only equities in the firms they control.

established that financial markets are more developed in countries where investors’ rights are better protected
and controlling shareholders are more important in countries where investors’ rights are less protected (see
La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (2000)). Hence, it could be that U.S. investors are more
reluctant to invest in countries with poorer investor rights and that our estimate of shares held by controlling
shareholders serves as a proxy for investor rights. We investigate this issue in multiple regressions and find
that differences in investor rights and financial development across countries cannot explain why U.S.
investors invest less in countries where large shareholders own a larger fraction of the market’s
capitalization.
The paper proceeds as follows. We first present in Section I a simple model to show the conditions
under which portfolio investors hold the world float portfolio. We then estimate in Section II the fraction of
shares held by large shareholders for 51 countries. In Section III, we compare the world market portfolio to
the world float portfolio. In Section IV, we show that the fraction of shares held by U.S. investors in 50
foreign countries is negatively related to the proportion of shares held by controlling shareholders. We
further show that the world float portfolio explains the stock holdings of U.S. investors better than the world
market portfolio. Section V concludes and discusses some additional implications of our results.

Section I. A simple model of portfolio holdings with controlling shareholders.
Consider a world with perfect financial markets. Risky assets include both domestic and foreign
stocks. For simplicity, there is no inflation and no exchange rate uncertainty.3 The investment opportunity
set is constant and asset prices follow lognormal diffusions. Define V to be the variance-covariance matrix

3

See Karolyi and Stulz (2001) for a review of how inflation and exchange rate uncertainty affect
portfolio choice in open economies. Models that focus on barriers to international investment usually
ignore inflation and exchange rate uncertainty like we do. The model we present is unchanged in the
presence of inflation and exchange rate uncertainty provided that returns are real returns, that purchasing
power parity holds, and that there is an asset that has a risk-free real return.

of domestic currency returns on risky assets,  the vector of expected domestic currency returns of risky
assets over the risk-free rate, and wki the vector of weights of risky assets in the portfolio of investor i of
country k. Investors can borrow or lend at the risk-free rate to satisfy their wealth constraint. If 1 is a vector
of ones, then 1'wki is the investor’s allocation to risky assets. Investors maximize the expected utility of their
terminal wealth. With these assumptions, each investor chooses the portfolio that minimizes volatility of
return subject to a constraint on expected return. Any investor holds the following portfolio of risky assets
regardless of the country he is from:

w ki =λ ki V -1μ

(1)

where ki is the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the constraint on expected return. Since all investors
hold the same portfolio of risky assets up to a scalar multiple, the fraction of holdings of risky assets a U.S.
investor invests in the U.S. must be the same as the fraction of holdings of risky assets any investor in the
world invests in the U.S. Since all investors hold any two risky assets in identical proportions regardless of
the country they are from, these proportions must be the proportions of the world market portfolio. Investors
therefore put their wealth in the riskless asset and in the world market portfolio of risky assets. With this
model, investors in a country have a home bias if the weight of home country risky assets exceeds the weight
of these assets in the world market portfolio. The world market portfolio includes all assets in positive net
supply. For simplicity, we assume that only common stocks are in positive net supply.
Let’s now add controlling shareholders to this simple world. Each one of these shareholders owns
a large stake in a firm and, as a result, controls that firm. To simplify the analysis, we assume that a
controlling shareholder has a control block in the firm that will not be sold, so that we do not analyze the
controlling shareholder’s decision to keep the block intact. There are no restrictions on borrowing and
lending, so that the controlling shareholder can always make the required investment to have a controlling
stake. We therefore model the controlling shareholder as a shareholder who chooses a portfolio by

5

minimizing return volatility subject to a constraint on the expected return of the portfolio and subject to the
constraint that he must hold enough shares of the firm to retain control.
We assume that to keep control the controlling shareholder has to own a fraction 7kj of the shares
of the firm he controls, firm kj. It will simplify the notation to adopt the convention that the controlling
investor of firm j in country k is investor j in country k. Throughout, when we refer to firm (or controlling
shareholder) xy, we mean firm y in country x. Controlling shareholders belong to the set c and portfolio
investors belong to the set nc. For all investors kj in c, let Wkj be the controlling investor’s wealth and Mkj
be the market capitalization of the firm that the investor controls. The controlling shareholder must invest
at least 7kjMkj/Wkj of his wealth in the equity of the firm to have control assuming that an investor’s
proportionate ownership of cash flow rights is his proportionate ownership of voting rights. The controlling
shareholder then solves his portfolio optimization problem subject to this constraint on his holdings of
shares:

where Qkj is the investor’s required expected return for the portfolio and hkj is a vector that has zeroes
everywhere except in its kj-th element. Solving for the optimal portfolio, we obtain:

kj

, the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the constraint that the controlling investor must hold enough

6

shares in the firm to have control, is equal to zero if the firm does not have a controlling shareholder. Absent
controlling shareholders, the log portfolio is proportional to the market portfolio. With controlling
shareholders, it no longer is. This is because the controlling shareholders do not divide their holdings
between the market portfolio and the risk-free asset.
The controlling shareholders divide their wealth among three portfolios: the risk-free asset, the log
-1

kj

portfolio, and the portfolio V h . The portfolio

V -1h kj is investor-specific. For controlling investor kj,

it is the minimum-variance portfolio that is constrained to have a portfolio weight of one in the common
stock of firm kj. To construct this portfolio, controlling shareholder kj must take long and short positions in
risky assets that reduce the risk he bears from his controlling stake. Suppose that all securities have zero
covariance with security kj except one security, security kv, which has positive covariance. In this case, the
hedge portfolio would have a short position in security kv given by the slope in a regression of the return of
security kj on the return of security kv.
In equilibrium, the demand for risky securities must equal their supply. Let M be the vector of the
capitalizations of common stocks so that Mkj, the capitalization of the common stock of firm kj, is the element
kj of the vector. Ww is the sum of the wealth of the investors in the world, then M/Ww corresponds to the
vector of portfolio shares of the world market portfolio, which we write wM. Capital market equilibrium
requires that:

The first term in the brackets is the covariance of a security with the world market portfolio – the numerator

7

of the security’s CAPM beta. Absent controlling shareholders, the term z in the square brackets is equal to
zero and the Sharpe-Lintner model holds. In the presence of controlling shareholders, z is not equal to zero,
so that the term in the brackets is not equal to the covariance of a security with the world market portfolio.
To understand how the presence of controlling shareholders affects the expected return of stock kj, we need
to consider the determinants of zkj.
The vector z is an adjustment factor due to the differential portfolio demands of the controlling
shareholders. The element kj of that adjustment factor is:

 ω kjM kj



where L is the expected excess return of the log portfolio and

(5)

kj
is the expected excess return on the
µ Hedge

hedge portfolio for controlling investor kj. Note that L must be positive.
From equation (4), the expected return on stock kj falls as zkj increases. Consider a stock that is
uncorrelated with all other stocks. The return on this stock cannot be hedged, so that the expected excess
return of the hedge portfolio for that stock is zero. Keeping the expected excess return on the log portfolio
constant, an increase in the fraction of the stock held by the controlling shareholder and an increase in the
capitalization of the stock both increase zkj and hence decrease the expected excess return on the stock.4
These results follow from the fact that as a stock’s ownership becomes more concentrated, portfolio investors

4

Note that the denominator is unchanged as the fraction of the stock held by the controlling
shareholder increases. The first term in the numerator increases. As the first term increases, the weight of
the stock in the log portfolio falls because the expected excess return of the stock falls, which decreases
the second term. However, the second term has a minus sign, so that the decrease in that term increases
the numerator.

8

hold less of the stock in their portfolio, so that they require a smaller risk premium to hold the supply of the
stock available to them.
In general, the portfolio share of a stock in the log portfolio will be trivial relative to the portfolio
share of that stock for the controlling shareholder. Consequently, the numerator of the term in brackets of
equation (5) will be positive. In the special case where stock returns are uncorrelated, there is no hedge
portfolio and the denominator is

μ L /σ kj2 , which is positive. We expect the denominator to be generally

positive because the hedge portfolio has primarily short positions if stock returns are positively correlated.
This means that the existence of a controlling shareholder for firm kj reduces the required return of that
firm’s stock relative to the CAPM for a given expected return on the market portfolio.
It is important to note that this result does not imply that going from an economy with no controlling
shareholders to one with controlling shareholders lowers expected returns on common stocks. This is because
introducing controlling shareholders affects 1/w. In the Sharpe-Lintner model, 1/w is the price of risk.
With controlling shareholders, it is not. An analysis of how 1/w changes as the degree of ownership
concentration in the economy changes is beyond the scope of this paper since portfolio shares are unaffected
by 1/w. Further, the value of a firm’s equity equals the expected cash flows to equity discounted at the
required return for equity. Because controlling shareholders extract private benefits of control, the expected
cash flows to minority shareholders are lower when the firm has a controlling shareholder, so that it would
not be correct to infer that firms with concentrated ownership are worth more than other firms for minority
shareholders because the discount rate for these firms is lower.
We can now solve for the holdings that portfolio investors must have in this model by substituting
equilibrium expected returns given by equation (4) into equation (1):

(6)

It immediately follows from equation (6) that portfolio investors do not hold the world market portfolio.
Consider two stocks, pq and kj. There is no controlling shareholder for firm pq, but there is one for firm kj.
If we ignore the impact of controlling shareholders, we would predict that each investor in the world should
hold the two shares in the ratio

M
wM
pq / w kj . Now, using equation (6), suppose that firm kj is uncorrelated

with all other securities. In this case, our model predicts that portfolio investors hold the two shares in the
M
2
ratio of w M
pq /(w kj − z kj / σ kj ) . We know already that in this case zkj is positive, so that portfolio investors

allocate more of their wealth to stock q relative to stock j than they would in a world without controlling
shareholders. With our assumptions, equation (6) therefore predicts that the portfolios of portfolio investors
in countries with few controlling shareholders will appear to have a home bias since portfolio investors
underweight stocks of firms with controlling shareholders.
The key implication of the asset demand equation for a controlling shareholder is that he uses risky
assets to reduce the risk resulting from his controlling stake. In a world where the investor could hedge his
controlling stake exactly, he would do so and then choose the same portfolio as any other investor.
Obviously, the investor is not able to hedge his controlling stake exactly – he cannot go short a security with
a return perfectly correlated with the return of the stock of firm kj. This leaves the investor in a situation
where he will choose to go short in the portfolio whose return is most highly correlated with the stock of firm
kj without including the stock of firm kj. In general, stocks from the investor’s home country, country k, are
likely to be positively correlated with the stock of firm kj. In perfect financial markets, we would therefore
expect controlling shareholders to go short stocks from their home country to hedge their controlling stake.

10

This would reduce the home bias predicted by our model since foreign investors and local portfolio investors
would have to buy the shares sold short by the controlling shareholders.
Selling stocks short is difficult and expensive in most countries. In addition, selling stocks short to
hedge a controlling stake requires the short-sale positions be kept in place as long as the investor holds the
controlling stake. If there is a chance that the investor would have to close the short sale, the investor might
have to sell shares from his controlling stake if the shares sold short have appreciated. Because of the risk
involved in shares, the controlling stake cannot be fully used as collateral for margin requirements for the
short sale. As a result, if the shares sold short appreciate, it is highly likely that eventually the controlling
shareholder would become liquidity constrained and would have to sell shares from his stake to meet margin
requirements. Consequently, hedging the controlling stake through short sales creates a substantial risk for
the controlling investor, making it unlikely that he will establish a hedge portfolio even if short-sales are
feasible.
If the controlling shareholder cannot sell shares short, an interesting case to consider is the one where
the controlling shareholder’s stock holdings consist only of his control block. This case assumes that the long
positions in stocks of controlling shareholders besides the control positions are economically unimportant.
Consequently, the market-clearing condition for the common stock of firm kj is:

∑

ki ∈ nc

λ ki V -1 µ W ki h kj = (1 - ω kj )M kj

where nc is the set of portfolio investors.
Solving for the asset demands of portfolio investors in equilibrium, we have:

 W w λ ki 

where (1 − ω ) ⊗ w

(8)

(1 − ω kj )w kjM , Wwnc is the aggregate wealth

of investors who are not controlling shareholders, and wnc is the wealth-weighted average of the Lagrangian
multiplier across investors who are not controlling shareholders. In this model, portfolio investors do not hold
the world market portfolio. More precisely, portfolio investors hold firms in the ratio:

(9)

The portfolio weight of stock pq falls relative to the portfolio weight of stock kj as the fraction of the shares
of firm pq held by the controlling shareholder increases. Stocks with the same proportional holdings by
controlling shareholders are held in the same proportion as their proportion in the world market portfolio,
but not other stocks.
We can also express holdings of firm pq as a fraction of the portfolio of risky assets of an investor
relative to what the holdings would be without closely held shares:

 w kipq
 M
 w pq


(1 − ω pq )

(10)

ki

where w pq denotes the portfolio weight of asset pq in investor ki’s portfolio of risky assets. The portfolio

weights

ki

w pq

sum to one, while the

w kipq

weights do not. The numerator on the right-hand side is the

fraction of the stock pq not held by controlling shareholders. The denominator of the right-hand side of this
expression corresponds to the fraction of a dollar of the world market portfolio that can be held by portfolio
investors. In the traditional CAPM, this fraction is one, and since there are no controlling shareholders, the
numerator is one also. Therefore, with the CAPM assumptions, each investor’s portfolio of risky assets is
the world market portfolio. The right-hand side of equation (10) exceeds one when a firm’s controlling
shareholders own a smaller fraction of the firm’s stock than the fraction of the world stock market wealth
held by controlling shareholders, and will be smaller than one otherwise.
In the presence of controlling shareholders, portfolio investors overweight the shares of countries
where the fraction of total capitalization held by controlling shareholders is smaller than the fraction of the
world market portfolio held by controlling shareholders and underweight the shares of other countries
relative to the world market portfolio weights. The U.S. is a country where the fraction of total capitalization
held by controlling shareholders is low. Suppose that the controlling shareholders in the U.S. hold 10% of
the U.S. market portfolio and the U.S. market portfolio is 49% of the world market portfolio. Suppose further
that, outside the U.S., controlling shareholders hold 50% of the capitalization of firms. The numerator of
equation (10) is 0.9. The denominator is 0.9 x 0.49 + 0.5 x 0.51, or 0.70. Consequently, for portfolio
investors, the U.S. has a weight equal to 1.29 times its weight in the world market portfolio, or 0.63. Assume
further that U.S. stock market wealth equals the capitalization of the U.S. stock market. With 10% of the U.S.
market held by controlling shareholders, our model predicts that U.S. shareholders hold 67% of the U.S.
market portfolio. With this example, roughly half of the home bias of U.S. investors is explained. As we will
see, the assumptions made in this example are not unreasonable. We can also predict the extent of the home

13

bias in a typical foreign country. We assume that controlling shareholders are domestic shareholders, which
is generally the case.5 Consider then a country that is 5% of the world market portfolio where controlling
shareholders hold 50% of the market capitalization. In this country, local shareholders hold more than 50%
of the market capitalization, even when portfolio investors do not have a home bias in that country.
There are good arguments for why asset demands of portfolio investors include hedging terms and
why foreign investors might be less well informed than domestic investors. The existing literature on the
home bias has analyzed how departures from mean-variance optimization can help explain the home bias.
Departures from mean-variance optimization would affect the holdings of portfolio investors in our model,
but they would not change the two key points we make, namely that the existence of controlling shareholders
implies that there is an inherent home bias in how investors in a country invest their wealth and that the
existence of controlling shareholders increases the portfolio shares of countries with dispersed firm
ownership for portfolio investors.

Section II. Controlling shareholders and the world market portfolio.
Our sample of U.S. investor holdings of foreign securities is taken from the 2000 version of the
Report on U.S. Holdings of Foreign Long-term Investments published by United States Department of
Treasury. The report examines foreign equity holdings in 164 countries by U.S. investors as of the end of
1997. The equity holdings are obtained from a survey by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve
Board of major custodians and large institutional investors. Participation in the survey is mandatory and lack
of compliance is subject to penalties. The primary source for the world market portfolio is the 1998
Emerging Markets Fact Book of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). We also use the data reported
by the Fédération Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs (FIBV), the World Bank, and the Salomon Guide
5

Unfortunately, except for Doidge (2001), the residence of controlling investors has not been
investigated in the literature. Doidge (2001) provides evidence that in a sample of firms that have ADRs,
almost all firms have resident controlling shareholders.

to World Equities of 1999. All sources report market capitalizations as of the end of 1997. For most
countries, the numbers provided by these various sources are very similar. However, there are some countries
with large differences – Ireland has a capitalization of $24 billion according to IFC but $49 billion according
to FIBV.6 We therefore make sure that our conclusions are not sensitive to these differences. We define
country k’s weight in the world market portfolio,

wM
k , as the ratio of the market capitalization of country

k divided by the market capitalization of all equity markets in the world as reported by the IFC.
To obtain the fraction of a firm’s shares that are closely held,

ω kj , we use the data on closely held

shares from the Worldscope Database. Closely-held shares correspond to shares held by insiders. Insiders
are considered to be officers, directors, and their immediate families, shares held in trusts, shares held by
another corporation (except shares held in a fiduciary capacity by financial institutions), shares held by
pension benefit plans, and shares held by individuals who hold 5% or more of the outstanding shares. For
Japanese firms, closely held shares represent the holdings of the ten largest shareholders.
The first column of Table 1 shows the number of firms in each country for which Worldscope has
any information for 1997. Worldscope typically has information on large firms in a country. Not surprisingly,
the number of firms in the dataset varies dramatically across countries, going from Slovakia, which has 2
firms in the dataset, to Japan, which has 2,409. Among the firms for which Worldscope has information, it
has ownership information for only a subset of firms. The second column in the table reports the number of
firms in each country for which ownership data is available. In some countries, the number of firms for which
ownership data is available is close to the number of firms in the Worldscope dataset. In other countries, only
a small fraction of firms have ownership information. For instance, Worldscope has ownership data on 2,392

6

As Ahearne, Griver, and Warnock (2001) point out “Differences between the two sources were
for the most part small or nonexistent, except for in the data for Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand,
where the IFC number was based on an incorrect currency conversion.” We use the FIBV number for
Ireland.

of 2,409 Japanese firms, but only 15 of 166 firms in Taiwan.
Our estimate of the fraction of

ω kj has an upward bias and several downward biases. The upward

bias is that the measure includes large holdings from shareholders who may not be part of the controlling
coalition. For instance, when T. Boone Pickens attempted to acquire a board seat at Koito Manufacturing
in the 1980s, he owned 26% of that company. With our approach, this stake would be part of the closely held
shares of the company, so that we would overstate the ownership of the controlling coalition for that
company.7 The downward biases appear more significant. The first downward bias is that if part of the stake
of a controlling shareholder is held through third parties, such as other corporations, that own small stakes
in the firm, we might miss these stakes altogether. For instance, a company with a controlling shareholder
who exerts control through fifteen stakes of 4% would appear to have no controlling shareholder with our
data. La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) show both that indirect ownership is important and
that finding the ultimate owner of a corporation is difficult. However, their analysis would also miss a
controlling shareholder who exerts control through fifteen stakes of 4%. The second downward bias is that
poor reporting and difficulties in identifying large blocks mean that some large blocks will not be noticed.
Importantly, disclosure requirements vary across countries and the disclosure requirements are not
consistently enforced. Worldscope cannot report undisclosed holdings. This may lead us to especially
understate the fraction of closely held shares in countries with poor disclosure requirements. The third
downward bias is that Worldscope has only the largest companies in a country. Controlling shareholders are
even more prevalent in the smaller companies, so that our estimate for a market is downward biased. This
third bias may not be important because the market portfolio for a country is value-weighted. Our dataset has
an extremely large number of firms, so that it would not be feasible for us to attempt to improve on the
Worldscope dataset.

This particular example does not affect our results because our data come from 1997. The
example is merely illustrative of possible biases.

16

The model of Section I assumes that there are no barriers to international investment. Such barriers
exist and they contribute to the home bias. In particular, in many countries, some shares cannot be held by
foreign investors. We use a market portfolio for each country that ignores the ownership restrictions against
foreign investors. The reason for proceeding this way is that we cannot distinguish within the controlling
block which shares have ownership restrictions and which do not. Consequently, what we call the portfolio
of available shares may include some shares that are not available to foreign investors. This would lead us
to underestimate the extent to which the existence of controlling shareholders reduces the home bias.
In order to aggregate the firm level data to the country level, we estimate the percentage of shares
closely held in a country by forming a value-weighted average of controlling stakes for the firms for which
Worldscope reports the data. The value-weighted estimate divides the sum of the market value of all closely
held shares in a country by the sum of the market value of all shares. We then use this value as our estimate
of the fraction of shares held by controlling shareholders for the country. This is shown in equation (11)
below where 7kj x Mkj is the market value of closely held shares in firm kj and Mkj is the market value of all
shares in firm kj. We construct this index for each country using only the firms with available data on
closely held shares in that country. Data on closely held shares are available for 51 countries:

The third column of Table 1 reports our estimate of the fraction of closely held shares for country k.
Worldscope reports firm data for the end of a firm’s fiscal year. Different firms in a country can have
different fiscal years, so that the market values using Worldscope can be measured at different points in time.
We therefore compute the fraction of closely held shares using end of December stock prices. The difficulty

17

with this approach is that while all the stock prices are from December 1997, we are using the number of
shares outstanding measured at different month ends. We also compute the fraction of closely held shares
using end of fiscal year data. The two approaches lead to estimates of the fraction of closely held shares that
are virtually identical. Except for three countries, the two approaches lead to estimates that are within one
percent of the country’s market capitalization. The difference is largest for China, where it is 4.45% of the
country’s market capitalization.
Table 1 shows that the U.S. is unique among the countries for which we have data. For the U.S., the
fraction of shares that are closely held is 7.94%, which makes the U.S. the country with the lowest valueweighted controlling ownership. The U.K. is next with 9.93%. Except for Ireland, Sri Lanka, the U.S., and
the U.K., no country has a value-weighted controlling ownership of less than 20%. Only seven countries have
value-weighted controlling ownership between 20% and 30%. Twenty-three countries have value-weighted
controlling ownership in excess of 50%.
La Porta, et. al (2000) provide evidence that common law countries protect investor rights better than
civil law countries. We would therefore expect that ownership is less concentrated in common law countries.
Nenova (2000) shows that the value of control is lower in common law and Scandinavian law countries.
Eight out of the eleven countries where value-weighted controlling ownership is below 30% are either
common law countries or Scandinavian countries. The exceptions are Mexico, Switzerland, and Taiwan.
Though a country with low ownership concentration is almost surely a common law country or a
Scandinavian country, a country with common law does not necessarily have low ownership concentration.
Common law countries are almost equally split between value-weighted ownership below 50% (eight
countries) and value-weighted ownership above 50% (seven countries). There is stronger evidence that the
value-weighted controlling ownership is negatively related to measures of capital market development. The
U.K. and the U.S. have the lowest value-weighted controlling ownership and the most developed capital
markets.

18

The last three columns show the market value of the firms for which we have information about
closely held shares, the market value of the country’s firms, and the percentage of the market capitalization
of the country represented by the firms for which we have information about closely held shares. For 19
countries, we have information on closely held shares for more than 80% of the market’s capitalization. For
some countries, the value of the firms for which we have information on closely held shares exceeds the
reported value of the market capitalization. This could arise for a number of different reasons. First, in some
cases, the market capitalization of IFC is low compared to the estimate of FIBV. Second, shares could have
been issued since the end of the fiscal year. Third, firms have different classes of shares, so that estimates
of firm market values could differ because of differences in ways of treating different classes of shares.
Fourth, some firms could be traded only on regional exchanges that may not be included in the IFC or FIBV
estimates. In any case, for the purpose of this study, the conclusion one has to draw from the last column of
Table 1 is that for many countries the market capitalization of the firms for which we have closely held
shares information is close to the market capitalization of all firms. Note that we do not use the percentage
in the last column in our analyses. The number we use is the percentage of shares which are closely held and
that number varies little if we compute it at either fiscal year end or calendar year end. Consequently, we are
reassured that the percentage of closely held shares is not sensitive to timing issues.
We compute, but do not report, an equally-weighted measure of controlling ownership. With that
measure, we average controlling ownership across the firms for which data is available. That measure is
higher in almost every country than the value-weighted ownership. This is not surprising since it puts more
weight on smaller firms and smaller firms tend to be more closely held. There are exceptions, though, but
none dramatic.

Section III. The home bias after taking into account closely held shares.
In the first column of Table 2, we report the weight of each country in the U.S. investors’ portfolio.

19

The second column shows the world market portfolio weight for each country in our dataset. The portfolio
weights range from 0.01% for Zimbabwe to 49.60% for the U.S. Out of the 51 countries, 43 countries have
a world portfolio share below 2%. Of the countries that have higher portfolio shares than 2%, only the U.S.
has a portfolio share greater than 10%.
The third column of Table 2 shows the fraction of the world float portfolio, which is constructed
using only the shares that are not closely-held. For each country, the available shares of firm kj represent a
fraction (1 − ω

kj

)w kjM of the world market portfolio. However, the portfolio weights of the world float

portfolio do not sum to one. After making this adjustment and summing the available shares across a country,
we get the portfolio weight of the country in the world float portfolio,

w = ∑w = ∑

(12)

The denominator on the right-hand side of the equation is the fraction of available shares in the world market
portfolio. The numerator is the fraction of available shares in country p’s market portfolio. Consequently,
a country will have a larger weight in the world float portfolio only if the fraction of shares available in that
country is greater than the fraction of shares available in the world market portfolio. The only countries with
greater weights in the world float portfolio than in the world market portfolio are Ireland, Sri Lanka, Sweden,
the U.K., and the U.S. The weight of the U.S. in the world float portfolio is 58.32%, in contrast to 49.60%
in the world market portfolio. For a number of countries, the drop in the portfolio weight is proportionately
large. An example is Brazil which falls from 1.12% to 0.47%. The weight of Brazil in the portfolio of
equities held by U.S. investors is 0.24%. Though the share of Brazil in the portfolio of U.S. investors is 21%
of Brazil’s weight in the world market portfolio, it is 51% of Brazil’s weight in the world float portfolio. This

20

effect takes place across countries, but obviously its importance depends on the extent to which shares are
closely held in a country.
Ahearne, Griver, and Warnock (AGW, 2001) introduce a measure of the home bias defined as one
minus the ratio of a country’s weight in the portfolio of U.S. investors divided by the country’s weight in the
world market portfolio. In the presence of closely-held shares, our analysis predicts a bias:

Predicted Bias = 1 −

w kUS
(1 − ω k )
1
=
−
′ −ω) ⊗ wM ]
wM
1[(1
k

(13)

The fourth column of Table 2 shows the AGW bias measure. The bias measure exceeds 0.5 for all countries.
Our predicted bias is positive in all countries but five and exceeds 0.5 in 14 countries. A negative bias means
that we expect a country to be overweighted in the portfolio of U.S. investors. U.S. investors are only
expected to overweight Ireland, Sri Lanka, Sweden, the U.K., and the U.S.
The average AGW bias is 0.81 while our average predicted bias is 0.33. The home bias does not get
eliminated when we take into account closely held shares. The means of the predicted bias and the AGW bias
are significantly different. Taking into account closely held shares using our measure brings the unexplained
bias to 0.48. Using the world market portfolio as a benchmark for evaluating the extent to which U.S.
investors have a home bias therefore builds in a substantial bias in the comparison. When one starts from the
world float portfolio, the home bias is 41% smaller.

Section IV. The determinants of the weight of foreign countries in the portfolio of stocks of U.S.
investors.
The first column of Panel A of Table 3 shows that the portfolio share of a country for U.S. investors
is positively related to the weight of that country in the world market portfolio. Absent a home bias and

21

absent closely-held shares, the coefficient on the world market portfolio weight of a country should be one.
Instead, the coefficient is 0.1496 with a t-statistic of 5.59. When we use the weight of a country in the world
float portfolio, the coefficient is 0.1610 and the t-statistic is 14.68. The adjusted R-square of the regression
increases from 0.8416 to 0.8816 when we substitute the weight of the float portfolio for the weight of the
market portfolio. In the third column, we report a regression with both weights. The weight of a country in
the world market portfolio is not significant in that regression. Finally, in the last column, we include in the
regression the weight of a country in the world market portfolio and the fraction of shares closely held in that
country. The fraction of shares closely held has a significant negative coefficient, so that U.S. investors have
a lower portfolio share of countries with a larger fraction of shares that are closely held. All these results are
consistent with the model of Section I. However, it is also clear that taking into account the fraction of shares
that are closely held does not make the home bias disappear.
In the second panel of Table 3, we examine whether there is information in the country weights of
the world float portfolio that is not in the country weights of the world market portfolio. For that purpose,
we use as explanatory variables the country weight in the world market portfolio and the residual from a
regression of the country weight in the world float portfolio on the weight in the world market portfolio. It
is clear from the regression that the weight in the world float portfolio has information that is not in the
weight of the world market portfolio. We then reverse the procedure to show that the weights of the market
portfolio have no information for understanding the country portfolio shares of U.S. investors that the
weights of the float portfolio do not have. It follows from this that any attempt at understanding the home
bias of U.S. investors should start from the world float portfolio.
We find that the fraction of closely held shares helps explain the country weights of the portfolio of
stocks of U.S. investors. It could be, however, that the float portfolio better explains the country weights in
the portfolio of U.S. investors than the market portfolio simply because the fraction of closely held shares
proxies for country characteristics that explain the country weights in the portfolio. In that case, controlling

22

for country characteristics would remove the explanatory power of the world float portfolio in a regression
that also includes the world market portfolio.
In Table 4, we take the regression of Panel A of Table 3 that regresses the portfolio share of a
country in the portfolio of stocks of U.S. investors on the world market portfolio weight and the world float
portfolio weight of a country and show that our results are robust to controlling for country characteristics.
If investors were to hold the world market portfolio, the only country characteristic that would matter for
their portfolio would be the share of the country in the world market portfolio. However, since we show that
the fraction of shares held by controlling shareholders is significantly related to the weight of a country in
the portfolio of U.S. investors, we have to be concerned that the fraction of shares held by controlling
shareholders proxies for country characteristics correlated with the fraction of shares held by controlling
shareholders. The literature predicts that ownership is more concentrated when investor protection is weaker.
Greater investor protection leads to greater financial development. Consequently, we examine whether
controlling for measures of investor protection and financial development affect our conclusions.
In all regressions of Table 4, we control for GNP per capita in 1997 to take into account the
correlation between the other variables and economic development. GNP per capita is significant at the 10%
level in only one regression. In the first regression, we control for the La Porta et al. (1998) anti-director
index. A higher value of the index means greater minority shareholder protection. La Porta et al. (1998)
compute this index by adding up dummy variables that take value one if a country does not block shares
before the shareholder meeting, if a country allows voting by mail, if it allows for cumulative voting or
proportional representation, if it has a mechanism for shareholders to pursue redress against decisions of the
company that they believe to be harmful, if it has preemptive rights, and finally if less than 10% of the
shareholder vote can call a shareholder assembly. We then control for measures of judicial efficiency,
corruption, and expropriation risk. These indices are those used by La Porta et al. (1998). The indices are
constructed so that a value of one means low investor protection and a value of 10 means high investor

23

protection. Countries with greater expropriation risk have a lower share in the portfolios of U.S. investors.
We control for the stock market capitalization per capita and for equity issues to GDP. These two measures
are computed for 1997 and are obtained from Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (1999). These measures are
unrelated to the share of a country in U.S. stock portfolios. Finally, we control for trade openness, defined
as the average trade share in GDP from 1985 to 1995, obtained from Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine
(1999). It is not significant. When we use all these variables in a regression, they increase the adjusted R2
by 3%. The corruption index is the only significant variable besides the weight in the world float portfolio.
The weight in the world float portfolio is highly significant in all the regressions of Table 4, while the weight
in the world market portfolio is never significant. Adding the country control variables to the regressions of
Table 3 affects none of our conclusions.
Though we do not reproduce the results, we estimate the regressions of Table 4 imposing the
requirement that a country has to have at least 5, 10, or 20 firms to be included in the regression. Our
conclusions are not affected by this requirement. We also estimate the regressions of Tables 3 and 4 using
only countries for which we have ownership data for at least 75% of the country’s market capitalization. This
requirement reduces the number of countries, but none of the conclusions we reach are affected when we
impose this requirement.

Section V. Conclusion and additional implications.
In this paper, we show that the home bias is intricately linked to corporate governance. When
companies are controlled by large investors, portfolio investors are limited in the fraction of a firm they can
hold. Portfolio investors cannot hold the world market portfolio in a world with controlling shareholders. We
show that the home bias is significantly smaller when one takes into account the extent to which shares are
held by controlling shareholders across the world. With our results, the removal of barriers to international
investment cannot make the home bias disappear, however. For the home bias to disappear, it is necessary

24

that investor rights improve across countries where firms are mostly controlled by large shareholders so that
it becomes optimal for firms to have atomistic shareholders in these countries.
Though we have focused on holdings of foreign shares by U.S. investors across countries, our results
have implications for two additional issues that have received attention over time:
1) Turnover and home bias. Tesar and Werner (1995) showed that foreign investors have greater
turnover than domestic investors. Warnock (2001) using different data finds that U.S. investors turn over
their foreign shares faster than their holdings of NYSE stocks but more slowly than their holdings of
NASDAQ stocks. Since controlling shareholders do not trade their holdings, our evidence suggests that for
foreign investors to trade more than the domestic investors who trade, one should observe a turnover ratio
for foreign investors that exceeds the turnover ratio of domestic investors by more than 33%. Unless the
turnover ratio of foreign investors is much larger than the turnover ratio of domestic investors, one has to
conclude that foreign investors trade less than domestic investors.
2) Bias of foreign investors toward large firms. Kang and Stulz (1997) show that foreign investors
in Japan have a bias towards holding larger firms. This size bias has been confirmed for other countries.
There are a number of possible explanations for this bias. However, there is evidence in the U.S. that smaller
firms are more likely to have high inside ownership (see Demsetz and Lehn (1985)). If this stylized fact for
the U.S. holds across countries, then the fraction of shares that are available to foreign investors is likely to
be proportional to size.

Table 4: Regression results using flow of funds US ownership of foreign stocks.
The world float portfolio is the world market portfolio adjusted to reflect that not all shares are available for purchase by portfolio investors. US$ GNP
per capita is the 1997 GNP per capita for each country measured in U.S. dollars. Anti-director rights is an index of the six variables that measure
shareholder rights in each country. The judicial efficiency index is an index that measures the efficiency of a country's judicial system. The corruption
index is a measure of a country's government corruption, and the expropriation risk index measures the risk of expropriation. These indices are from
La Porta, Lopes de Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998). Average Openness is the average openness from 1985 to 1995 for each country. The financial
development and openness variables are from Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (1999). All regressions use White standard errors.
