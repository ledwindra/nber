ABSTRACT
In this paper we study the role of the transportation sector in world trade. We build a spatial
model that centers on the interaction of the market for (oceanic) transportation services and the
market for world trade in goods. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as
equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices). Using detailed data on vessel movements and shipping
prices, we document novel facts about shipping patterns; we then flexibly estimate our model.
We use this setup to demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) implies that net exporters
(importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading to misallocation of productive activities across
countries; (ii) creates network effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on
trade flows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade that
was previously concealed by the common assumption of exogenous trade costs. Finally, we
illustrate how our setup can be used for policy analysis by evaluating the impact of future and
existing infrastructure projects (e.g. Northwest Passage, Panama Canal).

1 Introduction
Whether by sea, land or air, the entirety of trade in goods is carried out by the transportation sector.
With world trade at full steam- the sum of world exports and imports is now more than 50% of the global
value of production- the transportation sector has become central in everyday life. Yet, little is known
about how the market for transportation services interacts with the market for world trade in goods.
In this paper, we study how this interaction shapes trade ows, trade costs, the propagation of shocks
and the allocation of productive activities across countries. As we demonstrate, the transportation sector
(i) implies that net exporters (importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading to misallocation of productive activities across countries; (ii) creates network eects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact
of shocks on trade ows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade
that was previously shrouded by the common assumption of exogenous trade costs.
The transportation sector includes several dierent segments which can be split into two categories:
those that operate on xed itineraries, much like buses, and those that operate on exible routes, much
like taxis. Containerships, airplanes and trains primarily belong to the rst group, while trucks, gas and
oil tankers, and dry bulk ships to the second. Here we focus on oceanic shipping and in particular, dry
bulk shipping; 80% of world trade volume is carried by ships and dry bulkers carry about half of that.

1

Dry bulk ships are the main mode of transportation for commodities, such as grain, ore, and coal. They
are often termed the taxis of the oceans, as an exporter has to nd an available vessel and hire it for
a specic voyage, with prices set in the spot market. Despite the operational dierences of the various
transport modes, we argue that the core economic mechanisms hold for most, if not all of them.
We leverage detailed micro-data on vessel movements, as well as rich data on contracts between exporters and shipowners to uncover some novel facts. First, satellite data of ships' movements reveal that
most countries are either large net importers or large net exporters and that, related to this, at any point
in time a staggering 42% of ships are traveling without cargo (termed ballast). This natural trade imbalance is a key driver of trade costs. Indeed, transportation prices are largely asymmetric and depend on
the destination's trade imbalance: all else equal, the prospect of having to ballast after ooading leads
to higher prices. For instance, shipping from Australia to China is 30% more expensive than the reverse:
as China mostly imports raw materials, ships arriving there have limited opportunities to reload. This
phenomenon is pervasive in most, if not all modes of transportation: trucks, trains, container air and

ocean shipping, all exhibit similar price asymmetries that correlate with trade imbalances (the direction
of the imbalance, however, may be the opposite). In fact, the US-China trade decit in manufacturing
has incentivized US exports of low value cargo, such as scrap or hay, to ll up the empty backhauls.

2

Second, we compute the elasticity of trade with respect to shipping costs, by regressing trade by
country pair on the corresponding shipping price. To do so, we employ a novel instrument inspired by
the insight that the shipping price exporters face depends on how attractive their destination is to the
ship in terms of future loading opportunities, as discussed above. The estimated trade elasticity indicates
that the transport sector has a substantial impact on world trade, especially given the large uctuations
in shipping prices.
Third, a number of features of dry bulk shipping, such as information frictions and port infrastructure,
can hinder the matching of ships and exporters.
lead to unrealized potential trade.

We propose a novel test to argue that these frictions

The test is based on weather shocks at sea that exogenously shift

ship arrivals at port: in a frictionless world, in regions with more ships than exporters, the change in
the number of ships does not aect matches, since the short side of the market is always matched. Here,
instead, matches are indeed aected by weather shocks. In addition, the law of one price does not hold:
shipping prices exhibit substantial dispersion within a time-origin-destination triplet, also consistent with
frictions. Finally, at any given time, in most countries there are simultaneous arrivals of empty ships that
load and departures of empty ships, even though ships are homogeneous. This also suggests wastefulness.
Inspired by these facts, we build a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the market for
transport and the market for world trade in goods, that is in the spirit of the search and matching
literature.

The globe is split into a number of regions that trade with each other.

Geography enters

the model both through regions' location in space, as well as their natural inheritance in commodities of
dierent value. In each region, available ships and exporters participate in a random matching process.
When matched with an exporter, ships transport the exporter's cargo to its destination for a negotiated
price, and restart there. Ships that do not get matched decide whether to wait at their current location

2

In 2005, about 60% of the containers sent via ships from Asia to North America came back empty (Drewry Consultants),

and those that did come back full were often transported at a steep discount for lack of demand (...) Shippers are so eager
to ll their vessels for the return voyage to East Asia that they accept many types of unprotable cargo, like bales of hay.
Similarly, airlines had become so eager to put something in their cargo holds on the inbound journey to China that rates go
as low as 30 to 40 cents a kilogram, compared with $3 to $3.50 a kilogram leaving China [...] Very bluntly speaking, they're
ying in empty and ying out full. (The International Herald Tribune, 01/30/2006)
In trucking,  [b]ackhaul practices are extremely important in explaining dierences in prices; i.e.

the truck companies

are compensating their expenses on the empty backhaul in the rst leg of the trip. (The World Bank, 2012). Even Uhaul
moving trucks are priced similarly, Rent a moving truck from Las Vegas to San Jose and you'll pay about $100.

In the

opposite direction, the same truck will cost you 16 times that. (...) What accounts for the dierence? (...) With so many
people leaving the Bay Area, there are not enough rental trucks to go around. (SFgate, 02/15/2018).

or ballast elsewhere to search there. Exporters that get matched have their cargo delivered and collect
its revenue, while exporters that do not get matched wait at port. Finally, a large number of potential
exporters decide whether and where to export, thus replenishing the exporter pool seeking transportation.
We derive the equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices), as well as an expression for the equilibrium
bilateral trade ows, that is reminiscent of a gravity equation. As ships are forward-looking, trade costs
depend on the attractiveness of both the origin and the destination, a rich object that captures a region's
location, freight values, matching probabilities, as well as its neighbors' attractiveness. This insight applies
beyond dry bulk. Although other transport modes require dierent modeling assumptions regarding their
operational practices, in equilibrium, prices are formed by the optimizing behavior of forward-looking
transport agents and unavoidably depend, as above, on the attractiveness of origins and destinations, as
well as that of their neighbors.

3

Next, we estimate the model using the collected data. We rst estimate the matching function, which
gives the number of matches as a function of the number of agents searching on each side of the market.
A sizable literature has estimated matching functions in dierent contexts (e.g. labor markets, taxicabs).

4

Here, we adopt a novel approach to exibly recover both the matching function, as well as searching
exporters, which, unlike ships and matches, are not observed.

Our approach draws from the literature

on nonparametric identication (Matzkin, 2003) and, to our knowledge, we are the rst to apply it to
matching function estimation. Our approach extends the literature in two dimensions. First, we do not
take a stance on the presence of search frictions. When one side of the market (in this case exporters)
is unobserved or mismeasured, it is dicult to discern whether search frictions are present. Second, we
avoid parametric restrictions on the matching function; this is important, since in frictional markets, the
shape of the underlying matching function is directly linked to welfare.
We then estimate the remaining primitives including ship costs, the values of exporters' cargo and
exporter entry costs. In particular, we recover ship sailing and port costs from the optimal ballast choice
probabilities, via Maximum Likelihood, following the dynamic discrete choice literature (Rust, 1987).
Then, we obtain exporter valuations directly from observed prices. Finally, we use trade ows to recover
exporter costs by destination.

3

For instance, a model for container shipping (or other modes operating on xed itineraries), would likely feature a small

number of shipping rms that decide on their itineraries, as well as route pricing. The itinerary decision involves similar
trade-os as the ballast choice here; e.g. what network of countries can be serviced or how to manage backhaul trips. Prices
similarly depend on the number and valuations of exporters, ship supply and crucially, the entire route serviced including
the backhaul trips.

4

For instance, in labor markets, data on unemployed workers, vacancies and matches delivers the underlying matching

function. In the market for taxi rides, one observes taxis and their rides, but not hailing passengers; in recent work, Buchholz
(2018) and Frechette et al. (2018) have used a parametric assumption on the matching function, to recover the passengers.

4

Why is it important to account for the transport sector to study international trade in goods? We
illustrate the role of endogenous trade costs through three experiments.
First, we compare our setup to one with iceberg trade costs that are exogenous and depend only
on distance and the cargo's value, as is the case in canonical trade models. Strikingly, we nd that the
transport sector acts as a smoothing factor that reduces world trade imbalances. Indeed, under endogenous
trade costs net exporters (importers) export less (more) than under exogenous trade costs, leading to a
misallocation of productive activities from (ecient) net exporters to (inecient) net importers.

This

happens because of ships' equilibrium behavior and in particular the strength of their bargaining position
at dierent regions. Net exporters oer loading opportunities to ships, thus allowing them to command
high prices, which in turn restrains their exports. The converse holds for net importers. This argument
extends to a country's neighbors: a net exporter close to other net exporters oers even more options to
ships and prices are even higher, which inhibits the neighborhood's exports.
Second, we illustrate that the transport sector dampens the impact of shocks on trade ows, by
considering a fuel cost shock. A decline in the fuel cost has a direct and an indirect eect. The direct
eect is straightforward: as costs fall, shipping prices also fall and thus exports rise. The novel indirect
eect is that a decline in fuel costs improves a ship's bargaining position, as it makes ballasting less costly.
This dampens the original decline in prices and increase in exporting. Indeed, the overall increase in world
trade would be

40%

higher if ships were not allowed to optimally adjust their behavior, in response to a

10% decline in fuel costs.
Third, we explore the spatial propagation of a macro shock: a slow-down in China. Besides the direct
eect to countries whose exports rely heavily on the Chinese economy, the optimal reallocation of ships
over space dierentially lters the shock in neighboring vs. distant regions. Because of the slow-down,
fewer ships ooad in China, reducing ship supply in the region. Although this impacts negatively China's
own exports by raising prices, it benets distant countries, such as Brazil, because ships reallocate there.
Finally, we consider the role of maritime infrastructure on world trade, as an illustration of how our
setup can be used for policy evaluation. To do so, we examine the opening of the Northwest Passage: the
melting of the arctic ice would reduce the travel distance between Northeast America/Northern Europe
and the Far East. Although the shock is local, it has global eects: as Northeast America becomes a more
attractive ballasting choice, ships have a stronger bargaining position and demand higher prices, pushing
exports down everywhere else. Moreover, we consider the impact of four natural and man-made passages:
the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, Gibraltar and the Malacca Straits and show that all passages tend to

5

substantially increase world trade.

Related Literature

We relate to three broad strands of literature: (i) trade and geography; (ii)

search and matching; (iii) industry dynamics.
First, our paper endogenizes trade costs and so it naturally relates to the large literature in international
trade studying the importance of trade costs in explaining trade ows between countries (e.g. Anderson
and Van Wincoop, 2003, Eaton and Kortum, 2002).

In much of the literature, trade costs are treated

as exogenous and follow the iceberg formulation of Samuelson (1954). Here, we consider what happens
to trade ows when the equilibrium of the transport market is taken into account, so that transport
prices (an important component of trade costs, at least as large or larger than taris; Hummels, 2007) are
determined in equilibrium, jointly with trade ows. Moreover, related to some of our empirical ndings,
Waugh (2010) has argued that asymmetric trade costs are necessary to explain some empirical regularities
regarding trade ows across rich and poor countries.
We also contribute to a literature that has considered the role and features of the (container) shipping
industry; e.g. Hummels and Skiba (2004) explore the relationship between product prices at dierent destinations and shipping costs; Hummels et al. (2009) explore market power in container shipping; Ishikawa
and Tarui (2015) theoretically investigate the impact of backhaul and its interaction with industrial
policy; Cosar and Demir (2018) and Holmes and Singer (2018) study container usage; Asturias (2018)
explores the impact of the number of shipping rms on transport prices and trade; Wong (2018) incorporates container shipping prices featuring a round-trip eect in a trade model. Finally, recent work has
explored the matching of importers and exporters under frictions (Eaton et al., 2016, and Krolikowski and
McCallum, 2018).
Our paper is also related to both old and new work on the role of geography in international trade (e.g.
Krugman, 1991, Head and Mayer, 2004, Allen and Arkolakis, 2014), as well as the impact of transportation
infrastructure and networks (e.g. Donaldson, 2012, Allen and Arkolakis, 2016, Donaldson and Hornbeck,
2016, Fajgelbaum and Schaal, 2017). We extend this literature by demonstrating that the transport sector
reveals a new role for geography through three novel mechanisms (it misallocates productive activities,
creates network eects and dampens the impact of shocks).
Second, our paper relates to the search and matching literature (see Rogerson et al., 2005 for a survey).
Our model is a search model in the spirit of the seminal work of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), where
rms and workers (randomly) meet subject to search frictions and Nash bargain over a wage. An important

6

addition in our case is the spatial nature of our setup: there are several interconnected markets at which
agents (ships) can search. Such a spatial search model was rst proposed by Lagos (2000) (and analyzed
empirically in Lagos, 2003) in the context of taxi cabs. We borrow heavily from his model; the key dierence
is that prices are set in equilibrium, while in the taxi market prices are exogenously set by regulation.

5 Finally, as discussed

This is crucial, as the role of endogenous trade costs is at the core of our paper.

above, our paper also contributes to the literature on matching function estimation (see Petrongolo and
Pissarides (2001) for a survey).
Third, we relate to the literature on industry dynamics (e.g. Hopenhayn, 1992, Ericson and Pakes,
1995). Consistent with this research agenda, we study the long-run industry equilibrium properties, in our
case the spatial distribution of ships and exporters. Moreover, our empirical methodology borrows from
the literature on the estimation of dynamic setups (e.g. Rust, 1987, Bajari et al., 2007, Pakes et al., 2007;
applications include Ryan, 2012 and Collard-Wexler, 2013). Buchholz (2018) and Frechette et al. (2018)
also explore dynamic decisions in the context of taxi cabs' search and shift choices respectively. Finally,
Kalouptsidi (2014) has also looked at the shipping industry, albeit at the entry decisions of shipowners
and the resulting investment cycles in new ships, while Kalouptsidi (2018) focuses on industrial policy in
the Chinese shipbuilding industry.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a description of the industry and
the data used.

Section 4 describes the model.

empirical strategy, while Section 6 presents the estimation results. Section 7 demonstrates the importance
of endogenous trade costs, while Section 8 assesses the role of maritime infrastructure projects. Section

further data and estimation details.

2 Industry and Data Description
2.1

Dry Bulk Shipping

Dry bulk shipping involves vessels designed to carry a homogeneous unpacked dry cargo, for individual
shippers on non-scheduled routes. Bulk carriers operate much like taxi cabs: a specic cargo is transported

5

There are several other dierences between our setup and that of Lagos (2000) and Lagos (2003): we model also the

demand side (exporters/passengers); we allow for the potential of frictions in each region, while Lagos (2000) assumes that
matching is frictionless locally; we allow for several sources of heterogeneity in dierent regions (travel/port costs, distances,
matching rates); we allow trade to be imbalanced, while Lagos (2000) relies on taxi ows in and out of each location to be
equal- this distinction is also crucial.

individually by a specic ship, for a trip between a single origin and a single destination. Dry bulk shipping
involves mostly commodities, such as iron ore, steel, coal, bauxite, phosphates, but also grain, sugar,
chemicals, lumber and wood chips; it accounts for about half of total seaborne trade in tons (UNCTAD)
and 45% of the total world eet, which includes also containerships and oil tankers.

6,7

There are four categories of dry bulk carriers based on size: Handysize (10,00040,000 DWT), Handymax (40,00060,000 DWT), Panamax (60,000100,000 DWT) and Capesize (larger than 100,000 DWT).
The industry is unconcentrated, consisting of a large number of small shipowning rms (Kalouptsidi,
2014): the maximum eet share is around 4%, while the rm size distribution features a large tail of
small shipowners. Moreover, shipping services are largely perceived as homogeneous. In his lifetime, a
shipowner will contract with hundreds of dierent exporters, carry a multitude of dierent products and
visit numerous countries; we discuss this further in Section 3.3.
Trips are realized through individual contracts: shipowners have vessels for hire, exporters have cargo
to transport and brokers put the deal together. Ships carry at most one freight at a time: the exporter
lls up the hired ship with his cargo.

In this paper, we focus on spot contracts and in particular the

so-called trip-charters, in which the shipowner is paid in a per day rate.

ship is responsible for the trip costs (e.g. fueling), while the shipowner incurs the remaining ship costs
(e.g. crew, maintenance, repairs).

2.2

Data

We combine a number of dierent datasets. First, we employ a dataset of dry bulk shipping contracts,
from 2010 to 2016, collected by Clarksons Research. An observation is a transaction between a shipowner
and a charterer for a specic trip.

We observe the vessel, the charterer, the contract signing date, the

loading and unloading dates, the price in dollars per day, as well as some information on the origin and
destination.
Second, we use satellite AIS (Automatic Identication System) data from exactEarth Ltd (henceforth
EE) for the ships in the Clarksons dataset between July 2010 and March 2016. AIS transceivers on the
ships automatically broadcast information, such as their position (longitude and latitude), speed, and level

6

As already mentioned, bulk ships are dierent from containerships, which carry cargo (mostly manufactured goods) from

many dierent cargo owners in container boxes, along xed itineraries according to a timetable.

It is not technologically

possible to substitute bulk with container shipping.

7

It is not straightforward to obtain information on the share of world trade value carried by bulkers. However, mining,

agricultural products, chemicals and iron/steel jointly account for about 30% of total trade value (WTO, 2015).

8

Trip-charters are the most common type of contract.

Long-term contracts (time-charters), however, do exist:

on

average, about 10% of contracts signed are long-term. Interestingly, though, ships in long-term contracts, are often relet
in a series of spot contracts, suggesting that arbitrage is possible.

of draft (the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the ship's hull), at regular intervals
of at most six minutes. The draft is a crucial variable, as it allows us to determine whether a ship is loaded
or not at any point in time.
We also use the ERA-Interim archive, from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(CMWF), to collect global data on daily sea weather. This allows us to construct weekly data on the wind
speed (in each direction) on a

0.75°

grid across all oceans. Finally, we employ several time series from

Clarksons on e.g. the total eet and fuel prices, as well as country-level imports/exports, production and
commodity prices from other sources (e.g. Comtrade, IEA).

Summary statistics. The contract price per day is reported by Clarksons. To create the price per trip, we

multiply price per day with the average number of days required to perform the trip. Contracts per ship counts the
number of contracts observed for each ship in the Clarksons dataset. To proxy for trip duration, we compute the
nautical distance in miles and divide it by the average speed observed in the EE data. The probability of staying
at port is calculated from the EE data by computing the frequency at which waiting ships that did not nd a
contract in a given week remain at port instead of ballasting elsewhere. We have 12,007 observations of shipping
contracts and 393,058 ship-week observations at which the ship decides to either ballast someplace or stay at its
current location.

Summary statistics

As shown in Table 1, the average price is 14,000 dollars per day (or 290,000 dollars for the entire trip),
with substantial variation.

Trips last on average 2.9 weeks.

Contracts are signed close to the loading

date, on average six days before. The most popular loaded trips are from Australia, Brazil and Northwest
America to China, while the most popular ballast trip is from China to Australia (5.7% of ballast trips).

its current location. Ships that do not sign a contract, remain in their current location with probability
77%, while the remaining ships ballast elsewhere. Finally, Clarksons reports the product carried in about
20% of the sample. The main commodity categories are grain (29%), ores (21%), coal (25%), steel (8%)
and chemicals/fertilizers (6%).

3 Facts
In this section, we present some novel facts about the transport sector and trade: we rst discuss the
implications of trade imbalances (section 3.1); then, we quantify the impact of transport costs on world
trade (section 3.2); nally, we provide evidence of frictions (section 3.3). Throughout the paper, we most

11

often split ports into 15 geographical regions, depicted in Figure 10 in Appendix B.

3.1

Trade Imbalances

World trade in commodities is greatly imbalanced. Indeed, most countries are either large net importers
or large net exporters. This is shown in Figure 1, which plots the dierence between the number of ships
departing loaded and the number of ships arriving loaded, over the sum of the two. Australia, Brazil and
Northwest America are big net exporters, whereas China and India are big net importers.
The fact that global trade features such large imbalances is not as surprising; to a large extent, this
is due to the dierent natural inheritance of countries.
America are rich in minerals, grain, coal, etc.

For instance, Australia, Brazil and Northwest

At the same time, growing developing countries require

imports of raw materials to achieve industrial expansion and infrastructure building.

For instance, in

recent years, Chinese growth has relied on massive imports of raw materials. As a result, commodities
ow out of producers such as Australia and Brazil, towards China and India.
As a consequence of the imbalanced nature of international trade, ships spend much of their time
traveling ballast, i.e. without cargo. Indeed, we nd that 42% of a ship's traveled miles are ballast, so that
a ship is traveling empty close to half the time.

12 Finally, the trade imbalance is a key driver of the trade

costs that exporters face. First, a quick inspection of the data reveals that there are large asymmetries in
trade costs across space: for instance, a trip from China to Australia costs on average 7,500 dollars per

11

The trade-o is that we need a large number of observations per region, while allowing for sucient geographical detail.

To determine the regions, we employ a clustering algorithm that minimizes the within-region distance between ports. The
regions are: West Coast of North America, East Coast of North America, Central America, West Coast of South America,
East Coast of South America, West Africa, Mediterranean, North Europe, South Africa, Middle East, India, Southeast Asia,
China, Australia, Japan-Korea. We ignore intra-regional trips and entirely drop these observations.

This percentage is lower for smaller ships it is 32% for Handysize, 41% for Handymax, 45% for Panamax and 49% for

Capesize.

i to j

13 In fact, most trips

over the price from

j

to

i (highest

over lowest), is 1.6 and can be as high as 4.1.
We further investigate the determinants of trade costs by considering how shipping prices are associated
with the attractiveness of the destination, such as its demand for shipping. Indeed, ships may demand a
premium to travel towards a destination with low exports (e.g. China), to compensate for the diculty of
nding a new cargo originating from that destination. As shown in Column III of Table 2, shipping to a
destination where the probability of a ballast trip afterwards is ten percentage points higher, costs 2.3%
more on average. Similarly, a 10% increase in the average distance traveled ballast after the destination,
is associated with a 1.7% increase in prices.

3.2

Trade Elasticity

Do shipping prices have an impact on world trade? In this section we address this question in the context
of bulk shipping. Ideally, we would like to regress bilateral trade ows on shipping prices, i.e.,

log Qi→j
= β0 + β1 log τti→j + ijt

13

This price asymmetry has been documented also in container shipping; see e.g. Wong (2018) and references therein.

The instruments are

two countries are aected by shipping conditions on other routes, creating inter-dependencies and network
eects in trade costs; this mechanism, which is formalized in our model and is central to the paper, is
quantitatively important.
The second stage of the IV regression produces a trade elasticity of 1.02 with respect to shipping prices.

Recall that here we focus only on raw materials, hence

the supply chain should not be a concern (e.g. the instrument would be problematic if
we considered taris on cars). Moreover, we control directly for the taris from

15

We obtain yearly country-level trade ows from Comtrade and taris from the World Bank (WITS) and we focus only on

bulk commodities; yearly average shipping prices come from our Clarksons dataset. The results are robust if we add country
xed eects, or if we use the weighted average of taris instead.

13

In other words, a 1% increase in shipping prices leads to a 1.02% decline in trade ows. This elasticity
indicates that the transport sector has a substantial impact on world trade, especially given the large
observed uctuations in shipping prices (for instance, shipping prices experienced an 8-fold increase in the
late 2000s, see Kalouptsidi, 2014).
A few recent papers have estimated the same elasticity for the case of container shipping. Asturias
(2018), who uses population as an instrument, nds the elasticity to be about 5. Wong (2018), who uses
the round-trip eect as an instrument (in particular, for route
proxy for the predicted trade volume on route

i, j

she uses a Bartik-style instrument to

j, i) nds an elasticity of about 3.

It is also worth comparing

the elasticity of trade with respect to shipping prices to that with respect to taris, which is estimated to
be between 1.5 and 5 on average (e.g. Simonovska and Waugh, 2014, Caliendo and Parro, 2015, Brandt
et al., 2017 and Arkolakis et al., 2018).
somewhat lower.

The two elasticities are comparable, with our estimate overall

Recall, however, that we use total rather than waterborne trade value; therefore our

estimate should be considered a lower bound of the trade elasticity with respect to shipping prices, as it

ignores substitution towards other modes of transportation.

3.3

Search Frictions

A number of features of dry bulk shipping, such as information frictions and port infrastructure, can hinder
the matching of ships and exporters. In this section we argue that these frictions indeed lead to unrealized
potential trade. Consider a geographical region, such as a country or a set of neighboring countries, where
there are

s

ships available to pick up cargo and

e

exporters searching for a ship to transport their cargo.

We dene search frictions by the inequality:

m < min {s, e}

where

m

(1)

is the number of matched ships and exporters. In other words, under frictions there is potential

trade that remains unrealized; in contrast, in a frictionless world, the entire short side of the market gets
matched, so that

m = m(s, e),

m = min {s, e}.

When (1) holds, matches are often modeled via a matching function,

as is done extensively in the labor literature. As Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) note,  [...]

the matching function [...] enables the modeling of frictions [...] with a minimum of added complexity.
Frictions derive from information imperfections about potential trading partners, heterogeneities, the

16

For instance, if we exclude EU countries, which can easily substitute from oceanic shipping to land shipping, the elasticity

increases to -3.

commodities. To construct taris, we consider the minimum between the most favored nation tari and preferential
rates, if applicable, and consider a weighted average across commodities. Shipping prices are calculated from the

absence of perfect insurance markets, slow mobility, congestion from large numbers, and other similar
factors.
We present three facts consistent with frictions, as dened by (1). These facts are inspired by labor
markets, where search frictions are generally thought to be present. In particular, we (i) provide a direct
test for inequality (1); (ii) we document wastefulness in ship loadings; (iii) we document substantial price
dispersion.
First, we provide a simple

test for search frictions.

If we observed all variables

s, e, m,

it would be

straightforward to test (1); this is essentially what is done in the labor literature, where the co-existence
of unemployed workers and vacant rms is interpreted as evidence of frictions. However in our setup, as
discussed at length in Section 5.1, we observe

m

(i.e. ships leaving loaded) and

s,

but not

e;

we thus need

to adopt a dierent approach.
Assume it is known that there are more ships than exporters, i.e.

min (s, e) = e.

We begin with this

assumption, because our sample period is one of low shipping demand and severe ship oversupply due to
high ship investment between 2005 and 2008 (see Kalouptsidi, 2014, 2018). If there are no search frictions,
so that

m = min (s, e) = e,

small exogenous changes in the number of ships should not aect the number

of matches. In contrast, if there are search frictions, an exogenous change in the number of ships changes
the number of matches, through the matching function

m = m(s, e).

We thus test for search frictions by

using ocean weather conditions (unpredictable wind at sea), which aect travel times, to explore whether
exogenously changing the number of ships in regions with a lot more ships than exporters aects the

are more ships than exporters, for each region we consider weeks when there are at least twice as many
ships waiting in port as matches. Table 4 presents the results. We nd that indeed matches are aected
by weather conditions in all regions, consistent with the presence of search frictions.
Second, we document

empty ships.

simultaneous arrivals

of empty ships that then load

and departures of

Indeed, the rst two panels of Figure 2 display the weekly number of ships that arrive

empty and load, as well as the number of ships that leave empty, in two net exporting countries: Norway
and Chile. In Norway, several ships arrive empty and load, but almost no ship departs empty. In Chile,
however, the picture is quite dierent: it frequently happens that an empty ship arrives and picks up
cargo, while at the same time another ship departs empty.

17

This is suggestive of wastefulness in Chile:

In particular, we divide the sea surrounding each region into zones; for each zone we use information on the wind speed

at dierent distances from the coast and in dierent directions. To obtain the unpredictable component of weather we run
a VAR regression of these weather indicators. The results are robust to the lag structure, as well as estimating jointly for
neighboring zones.

Test for search frictions.

Regressions of the number of matches in each region on the unpredictable

component of weather conditions in the surrounding seas. For each region we use weeks in which there are at least
twice as many ships as matches.

The rst column reports the number of observations; the second column joint

signicance; and the third column the average ratio between matches and ships in each region during these weeks.
To proxy for the unpredictable component of weather, we divide the sea surrounding each region into 8 dierent
zones (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest both within 1,500 miles of the coast and betwen 1,500 and
2,500 miles from the coast), and we use the speed of the horizontal (E/W) and vertical (N/S) component of wind
in each zone to proxy for weather conditions.

We run a VAR regression of these weather variables on their lag

component and season xed eects and use the residuals, together with their squared term, as independent variables
in the regression.

why does the ship that depart empty, not pick up the cargo, instead of having another ship arrive from
elsewhere to pick it up?
This pattern is observed in many countries. Indeed, the third panel of Figure 2 depicts the histogram
of the bi-weekly ratios of outgoing empty ships over incoming empty and loading ships for net exporting
countries. In the absence of frictions, one would expect this ratio to be close to zero. However, we see that
the average ratio is well above zero. Moreover, this pattern is quite robust in a number of dimensions.
Third, again inspired by the labor literature, we investigate

dispersion in prices.

18

In markets with no

frictions, the law of one price holds, so that there is a single price for the same service. This does not hold
in labor markets, where there is large wage dispersion among workers who are observationally identical.

18

This gure is robust to alternative market denitions, time periods and ship types. Capesize vessels exhibit somewhat

larger mass towards zero, consistent with the somewhat higher concentration of ships and charterers, as well as the ships'
ability to approach fewer ports. The gure is also similar if done by port rather than country. To control for repairs we
remove stops longer than 6 weeks. Finally, we only consider as ships arriving empty the ships arriving empty and sailing
full towards another region, and we consider as ships leaving empty ships sailing empty toward a dierent country; so
movements to nearby ports are excluded. This denition also implies that refueling cannot explain the fact either- though
there are very small dierences in fuel prices across space anyway (less than 10%).

Simultaneous arrivals and departures of empty ships: The rst two panels depict the ow of ships

This observation has generated a substantial and inuential literature on frictional wage inequality, i.e.

19 As we already saw in Table 2 there is substantial

wage inequality that is driven by search frictions.

price dispersion in shipping contracts. More specically, at best we can account for about 70% of price
variation, controlling for ship size, as well as quarter, origin and destination xed eects. Moreover, the
coecient of variation of prices within a given quarter, origin and destination triplet is about 30% (23%)
on average (median). In the most popular trip, from Australia to China, the
is on average 34% and ranges from 15% to 65% across weeks.

weekly

coecient of variation

In addition, it is worth noting that the

type of product carried aects the price paid and overall more valuable goods lead to higher contracted
prices, as shown in Table 2. In the absence of frictions, if there are more ships than exporters, as is the
case during our sample period, we would expect prices to be bid down to the ships' opportunity cost.

20

In contrast, in markets with frictions and bilateral bargaining, as shown formally in the model of Section
4, the buyer's valuation aects the price he pays and exporters with higher valuations pay more.
As in labor markets, a multitude of factors can lead to frictions (i.e. unrealized matches) in shipping.
First, the decentralized and unconcentrated nature of the market and the mere existence of brokers, suggest
that information frictions are present.

21 Port infrastructure, congestion or capacity constraints may also

hinder matching. In addition, regulations may impose special ship requirements (e.g. ags, environmental

19
20

See for instance Burdett and Mortensen (1998), Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002), Mortensen (2003) and references therein.
In a frictionless market with more ships than freights and homogeneous ships, in equilibrium the price from an origin to

a destination would be such that ships are indierent between transporting the cargo and staying unmatched.

The meeting process involves a disperse network of brokers; oftentimes more than two brokers intervene to close a deal,

suggesting that the ship's and the exporter's brokers do not always nd each other, and that an intermediate broker was
necessary to bring the two together (Panayides, 2016). In interviews, brokers claimed to receive 5,000-7,000 emails per day;
sorting through these emails is reminiscent of an unemployed worker sorting through hundreds of vacancy postings.

rules). Finally, heterogeneities, such as long-run relations or special cargo requirements in ship investments
may result in unrealized trade.
While in labor markets, as some researchers have argued, observed or unobserved heterogeneity may
partly explain the documented facts, in shipping heterogeneity is much more limited. Indeed, the data
suggests that ship heterogeneity alone is not a prominent explanation for search frictions. Ships do not
specialize neither geographically, nor in terms of products: the majority of ships deliver cargo to 13 out of
15 regions and carry at least 2 of the 3 main products (coal, ore and grain). Moreover, neither shipowner
characteristics, nor shipowner xed eects have any explanatory power in price regressions, as shown in
Table 9 in Appendix B, while ballast decisions of ships in the same region are concentrated around the
same options.

22 Nonetheless, despite the anecdotal and descriptive evidence presented, it is not possible

to reject that heterogeneity can also play a role in the market.

4 Model
In this section, motivated by the above ndings, we introduce a spatial model that centers on the interaction
between the market for transport and the market for world trade in goods. In each period, the timing is as
follows: In each region, available ships and exporters participate in a random matching process. Ships that
get matched transport their exporter's cargo to its destination for a negotiated price, and restart there.
Ships that do not get matched decide whether to wait at their current location or ballast elsewhere and
search there. Exporters that get matched have their cargo delivered and collect their revenue. Exporters
that do not get matched wait at port. Finally, a large number of potential exporters decide whether and
where to export, thus replenishing the exporter pool seeking transportation the following period.
We rst lay out the model's setup; we then present the agents' value functions and derive the equilibrium objects of interest: trade costs (shipping prices) and trade ows (gravity equation). We close the
section with a detailed discussion of our main assumptions.

destinations is higher than 70% in most regions). Moreover, home-ports are not an important consideration for shipowners,

As discussed in

Section 3.3, the matching function captures the implications of frictional trading, in a parsimonious fashion.
In other words, we do not explicitly model the meeting technology between exporters and ships, which
would introduce intractable complexities; instead, the matching function captures the several realities
of the market discussed earlier, without explicit reference to the source of the friction (Petrongolo and
Pissarides, 2001).
When a ship and an exporter meet, they either agree on a price to be paid by the exporter to the ship
or they both revert to their outside options. The outside option of the exporter is to remain unmatched
and wait for another ship, while the outside option of the ship is to either remain unmatched in the current
region or to ballast elsewhere. The surplus of the match over the parties' outside options is split via the
price-setting mechanism. The price,

Discussion

We close this section with a discussion on several of our assumptions and some caveats.
We begin our discussion with the

matching process.

In our model the matching function is local, so

that an exporter meets a ship only if they are in the same region, much like taxis and passengers. This
is a modeling assumption, as there is no technological or other constraint that prevents an exporter from
meeting and matching with a ship in another region. Nonetheless, there are economic disincentives that
make distant matching unlikely, suggesting this is a reasonable approximation.
More specically, practitioners explain that contracts tend to be signed with ships that are nearby,
by arguing that a ship is not a train and it cannot promise exact arrival times far in advance due to
weather conditions and port congestion. These delays are costly for exporters. Moreover, ships that are
already in the region of the exporter have a distinct cost advantage over ships in other regions, since they
do not need to incur the additional cost of sailing empty to the exporter's region. Given that ships are in
oversupply during our time period, exporters are not willing to pay (and wait) in order to contract with
ships that are far away.

26 Reassuringly, the data support the local matching function assumption. For

instance, about 20% of the contracts specify dierent signing and loading regions. Furthermore, as shown
in Table 1, contracts are signed just 6 days on average prior to the loading date. In addition, the satellite
data reveals that ships enter the region within 12 days of loading, which is well before the signing date.
Also related to the matching process, we assume that exporter valuations are suciently high so that
in equilibrium, when a ship and an exporter meet, they always agree to form a match.

It is easy to

see that for every origin-destination pair, there exists a threshold of exporter value, below which the
match surplus becomes negative and meetings do not result in matches.

26

In this case, the price that a

We formalize this using the model estimates produced in Section 6. In particular, we use our model to examine whether

an exporter would benet from searching in multiple regions. We nd that when we allow an exporter to search in the best
other region, in addition to the loading region, exporters always prefer to match with a ship in the loading region. The large
majority of matches (>80%) still take place in the loading region. In addition, the price paid and the exporter value function
are virtually unchanged.

25

ship demands to stop searching is too high for the low value exporters to pay and the match becomes
unprotable. Thus, the support of the distribution of revenues,

Fijr ,

needs to be bounded below by this

threshold. This assumption is reasonable in our context, since exporter revenue is an order of magnitude
higher than transport prices. Using the model estimates produced in Section 6, we nd that the surplus
from matching is fairly high; on average it equals 371,270$, and it remains high even if we focus on the
lowest priced commodity, namely coal (the average surplus in this case is $249,150, well above zero). This
is not surprising: to get a sense of the magnitudes, the average value of a coal cargo is $3,864,250, while
its average shipping price is $297,720.
Next, it is important to discuss how the model's main outputs would change in the

frictions;

i.e. if the matching function were assumed to be

absence of search

In a world without search

τij = Ui −Vij , therefore the properties

of endogenous trade costs (dependence on distance, origin, destination and entire network of countries) are
independent of the presence of search frictions and

still hold.27

The paper's main implications presented

in Section 7 are thus not driven by search frictions, but rather by the endogeneity of trade costs.
We now turn to the

steady state

assumption of our industry model, which follows the tradition of

Hopenhayn (1992) and a large body of other work in macro, IO, trade, etc. In particular, we consider the
steady state of our dynamic system, where agents' strategies and value functions depend only on their own
state and the long-run average aggregate state, which is constant. This assumption renders the problem
more tractable and allows us to derive simple(r) expressions for prices and trade ows.
It is worth connecting this assumption to the empirical exercise coming up. Naturally, the data exhibits
variation over time. Strictly speaking, our empirical approach relies on the assumption that agents play

28

against the steady state; i.e. their strategies rely on their own state and the long-run industry average.

That said, the steady state assumption is not unreasonable for the data at hand, which covers a period
that is uniformly characterized by ship oversupply and relatively low demand for shipping services without
any major shocks.

Moreover, given the short-lived nature of the ships' ballasting decisions it does not

feel unreasonable that they would ignore aggregate long-run shocks when making these weekly choices; in
addition, transition dynamics to a new steady state should be short given that a ship can travel to most
ports in the world in a month.

Finally, in the trade literature, trade costs include transport costs, taris and other barriers. Here we
focus on microfounding and endogenizing transport costs. In our setup, other trade barriers are included in

In addition, we do not consider the determination of commodity prices;

in other words, we take exporter valuations

to be exogenous. Determining this object in equilibrium

within our setup is an interesting avenue for future research.

5 Empirical Strategy
In this section we lay out the empirical strategy followed to estimate the model of Section 4. Our empirical
exercise consists of two distinct components: (i) estimation of the matching function and the searching
exporters; (ii) estimation of ship travel and wait costs, exporter valuations and costs. We describe the
empirical strategy for each component here, and present all results in Section 6.

5.1

Matching Function Estimation

A sizable literature has estimated matching functions in several dierent contexts (e.g.

labor markets,

marriage markets, taxicabs). For instance, in labor markets, one can use data on unemployed workers,
job vacancies and matches to recover the underlying matching function. In the market for taxi rides, one
observes taxis and their rides, but not hailing passengers; in recent work, Buchholz (2018), and Frechette
et al. (2018) have used such data, coupled with a parametric assumption on the matching function
to recover the hailing passengers.

32 Similar to the taxi market, we observe ships and matches, but not

searching exporters. Here, we adopt a novel approach to simultaneously recover both exporters, as well
as a nonparametric matching function.
that they do not.

30

It also worth noting that risk neutrality is a natural starting point for our analysis. In our setup, agents make risky

decisions at a weekly frequency, so it may be reasonable to expect that over the course of the year risk washes out. Moreover,
in our data we nd that neither the variance of prices, nor of trip durations aect ships' ballast decisions.

31

It is straightforward to include a ship free entry condition in the model in order to consider longer-run counterfactuals.

However in this case, we would need to take a stand on shipowners' expectations of future demand.

32

Buchholz (2018) assumes an urn-ball matching function. Frechette et al. (2018) construct a numerical simulation of taxi

drivers that randomly meet passengers over a grid that resembles Manhattan; this spatial simulation essentially corresponds
to the matching function, and can be inverted to recover hailing passengers.

27

Our approach extends the literature in two dimensions. First, we do not take a stance on the presence
and magnitude of search frictions in the industry. Consider the case of no search frictions, so that the
matching function is,

mit = min (sit , eit )

search frictions, we have

and all potential matches are realized. In contrast, if there are

mit = mi (sit , eit ) ≤ min (sit , eit ) , so that some potential matches are not realized.

If one side of the market is unobserved (here

eit )

or mismeasured it is not straightforward to dierentiate

these two cases. The test presented in Section 3.3 serves to distinguish the two cases.
Second, we avoid imposing parametric restrictions on the matching function. The literature has imposed functional forms, most commonly the Cobb-Douglas; but parametric restrictions are directly linked
to welfare and so can be overly restrictive. For instance, it has been shown in a wide class of labor market
models, that the condition for constrained eciency depends crucially on the elasticity of the matching
function with respect to the search input (Hosios, 1990). In much of the matching function estimation
literature this elasticity has been restricted to be constant.

Our approach relies on the literature on nonparametric identication (Matzkin, 2003) and nonseparable
instrumental variable techniques (e.g. Imbens and Newey, 2009).

1 = m(s̄, 1),

so that one exporter is always

thus obtaining a conservative bound on search frictions.

by assumption; then, due to homogeneity, this derivative also delivers the derivative

and once these derivatives are known, integration leads to the matching function, which can

be inverted to provide the number of exporters.
The CRS assumption is a reasonable starting point. In the labor literature, the majority of matching
function estimates nd support for constant returns to scale; as Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) point
out divergences from constant returns are only mild and rare. Nonetheless, to explore the robustness of
our ndings, in Section 6.1 we consider an alternative approach that does not make an assumption on the
returns to scale, but instead relies on a restriction on the distribution

33

Fe

(Poisson).

For instance, one can use a simple frequency estimator:

Fm|s=st (mt |s = st ) = Pr (m ≤ mt |s = st ) =
where

1 {·}

denotes the indicator function and

#

Pr (m ≤ mt , s = st )
#1 {(m ≤ mt , s = st )}
=
Pr (s = st )
#1 {(s = st )}

denotes the number of times. In practice, we use a Gaussian kernel density

estimator.

29

Finally, as mentioned above, independence of ships and exporters is not a natural assumption in
our setting. To relax it, we employ the literature on nonlinear IV techniques (e.g. Imbens and Newey,
2009, while for an application similar to ours see Bajari and Benkard, 2005). In particular, assume that
an instrument

These parameters determine ships' optimal ballast choice probabilities, (5) and (6),

Thus, we can estimate them via Maximum Likelihood using

the observed ship choices. In particular, we use a nested xed point algorithm to solve for the ship value
functions at every guess of the parameter values, compute the predicted choice probabilities and then

30

calculate the likelihood, as in Rust (1987). We provide the details of the approach in Appendix D, where
we also prove that our value functions are well-dened using a contraction argument.
As is always the case in dynamic discrete choice, not all parameters are identied and some restriction
needs to be imposed. Here, we have

I2 + 1

parameters and

I2 − I

choice probabilities, so we require

I +1

restrictions; we show this formally, borrowing from the analysis of Kalouptsidi et al. (2016) in Appendix
E.

The additional restrictions amount to using observed fuel prices to determine

Section 6.2. Note also that the observed prices pin down the scale of payos (in dollars) and allow the

vessels), we rst scale the production to adjust for the coverage of our data (we observe about half of the total eet) and
then divide by the average active ship size, taking into account a ship's utilization rate and the fact that a ship operates
on average 340 days per year (due to maintenance, repairs, etc)

Matching Function

We now present the estimates for the exporters and the matching function, obtained as described in Section
5.1.

37 The matching function is estimated separately for each region i.
First, we present the results from the rst stage regression of the number of ships on the unpredictable

component of weather in surrounding seas for all regions. The results, shown in Table 5, indicate that
ocean wind has a signicant impact. This suggests that weather indeed aects trip duration and therefore
weather shocks exogenously shift the supply of ships at port.

Regressions of the number of ships in each region on

The rst column reports the joint

signicance of the instruments and the second column the F-statistic. For the construction of the instrument, see
Table 4.

Figure 3 presents the weekly average number of exporters in each region. Not surprisingly perhaps,
exporters are concentrated in Australia, the East Coast of North and South America and Southeast Asia,
which are all rich in raw materials. India, Africa and Central America have the fewest exporters.
The matching function has reasonable properties.

Exporters have substantially higher chances of

nding a match than ships, consistent with our sample period of high ship supply and low demand. The

The results are fairly robust to the choice of the bandwidth parameters, though some sensitivity is to be expected. In

addition, the data exhibits sucient variation over time to perform the nonparametric analysis.

38

This is consistent with contracting practices, where the ship promises a range of fuel consumption based on dierent

weather conditions. Moreover, regressing the log of trip duration on wind speed, both upon arrival at the destination and
upon departure at the origin conrms that the weather strongly aects trip duration; indeed, trips are 11% longer on average
under bad weather conditions.

matching rate for ships (exporters) declines as the market gets crowded with ships (exporters). Moreover,
we nd that regional heterogeneity is important: imposing a single matching function across regions leads
to severely biased estimated exporters and matching function elasticities.

To illustrate the importance

of the nonparametric approach, we compare our estimated matching function to a typical parametric
specication:

the Cobb-Douglas.

This specication, which is common in the literature, imposes that

the elasticities of the matching function are constant, a property that can be restrictive.

Figure 11 in

Appendix B plots our estimates for the elasticity of matches with respect to the number of ships at port,

s (e, s) =

∂mi (e,s) s
∂s
m , across regions.

Our nonparametric matching function strongly rejects that these

elasticities are constant: on average the range of these elasticities is 33% of the elasticity at the average
level of ships and exporters in each region.

In addition, we estimate a Cobb-Douglas specication for

the matching function and nd that the exporters recovered under this, more restrictive, assumption are
dierent both in magnitude (the average absolute error is 63%) and in the relative ranking of regions,
compared to the nonparametric case.

39

To measure the extent of search frictions in dierent regions, we compute the average percentage
of weekly unrealized matches; i.e.

(min{si , ei } − mi ) / min{si , ei }.

The results are plotted in the left

panel of Figure 4 along with condence intervals constructed from 200 bootstrap samples, and reveal that

39

The Cobb-Douglas specication,

i 1−αi
,
mit = Ai sα

is not straightforward to estimate, as

eit

is not observed. We rewrite

it as,

log (mit ) = log (Ai ) + (1 − αi ) log eit + αi log sit = αi0 + it + αi log sit
and we recover

αi

using an instrument (the unpredictable component of weather) for

34

sit .

search frictions are heterogeneous over space and may be sizable, with up to 20% of potential matches
unrealized weekly in regions like South Africa and parts of South America and Europe.
12.7% of potential matches are unrealized.

On average,

40 We can also reject that the matching function equals the

minimum for all regions.
Moreover, as shown in the right panel of Figure 4, the estimated search frictions are positively correlated
with the observed within-region price dispersion, another indicator of search frictions. We also nd that
the frictions are negatively correlated with the Herndahl Index of charterers in a region; this suggests
that when the clientele is disperse, frictions are higher.

Moreover, they are negatively correlated with

the index of quality of port infrastructure issued by Index Mundi, so that regions whose ports have a
low quality score, suer from higher matching frictions. Finally, when we estimate the matching function
separately for Capesize (biggest size) and Handysize (smallest size) vessels, we nd that for Capesize,
where the market is thinner, the ratios of unrealized matches are lower.

calculated from the Clarksons contract data.

Price dispersion is computed from the residuals of a regression of

prices on ship characteristics, origin, destination and time xed eects. Port quality is obtained from the index of
quality of port infrastructure issued by Index Mundi.

We close this section by discussing the robustness of our results to the CRS assumption. To do so,
instead of assuming CRS, we impose a parametric assumption on the distribution of exporters,

40

Fe .

In

It is worth noting that this does not imply that in the absence of search frictions we would have 12.7% more matches,

as we would need to take into account the optimal response of ships and exporters. This is simply a measure of the severity
of search frictions in dierent regions.

35

particular, we assume that exporters are distributed Poisson, as we can then interpret the number of
freights

et

as the number of arrivals of exporters at port every week. We estimate the number of exporters

41 The results, shown

and the matching function following an analogous strategy, based on Matzkin (2003).

in Figure 12 in Appendix B, are robust to this alternative restriction. Moreover, we nd that the implied
degree of homogeneity of the matching function under the Poisson distributed exporters is roughly equal
to one, even though we do not assume CRS.

Ship Costs and Exporter Valuations

continent and coast of the origin; and we estimate port wait costs

i

to

for all

roughly based on the

i.42

Note that

csij

is the

and its major component is the cost of fuel. Following the discussion

on identication in Section 5.2, we set this cost for one of the groups (for trips originating from the East
Coast of North and South America) equal to the average weekly fuel price (40,000 US dollars). Moreover,
since the fuel cost is paid by the exporter when the ship is loaded, we add it to the observed prices.
The rst two columns of Table 7 report the results.

43

Sailing costs are fairly homogeneous.

Port

wait costs are more heterogeneous and large, ranging between 90,000 and 290,000 US dollars per week.
Consistent with industry narratives, waiting at port is costly, both due to direct port and security fees, as
well as the rapid depreciation of the ship's machinery and electronics and antifouling costs caused by the
accumulation of microorganisms during immobility. Ports in the Americas are the most expensive, while
ports in China, India, and Southeast Asia are the cheapest. The standard deviation of the logit shocks,

σ,

is estimated at about 16,000 US dollars, roughly 5% of the average trip price including the fuel cost

payment. This suggests that the logit shocks do not account for a large part of utility or ballast decisions.
As shown in Figure 13 in the Appendix, the model's t is very good, as our predicted choice probabilities

The standard errors are computed from 200 bootstrap samples with the resampling done at the ship level. We combine

these bootstrap samples with those of the matching function to incorporate the error from the matching function estimation.

As our data comes from a period of historically low shipping prices, our estimated value functions are negative. This

is partly due to the fact that we are not modeling ships' expectations, so the value function does not take into that under

Exporter valuations. The left panel of the gure plots the estimates for the average exporters' valuation

across regions. The right panel correlates the average exporters' valuation with the share of exports in grain (source,
Comtrade). The size of the circle proxies the number of observations.

In the left panel of Figure 5 we plot the average exporter revenues across origins, while the third
column of Table 7 reports the estimates. We estimate the bargaining coecient to equal

γ = 0.3.

There

is substantial heterogeneity in exporter revenues across space. South and North America have the highest
revenues, while China, Japan, and Southeast Asia have the lowest.

This ranking is reasonable, as for

instance, Brazil exports grain which is expensive, whereas Southeast Asia exports mostly coal, which is
one of the cheapest commodities. We generalize this example by focusing on grain, the most expensive
frequently shipped commodity. In particular, using data from Comtrade, we explore whether regions that
have a high share of grain exports tend to have higher estimated revenues.

The results, shown in the

right panel of Figure 5, reveal that indeed there is a positive correlation between the two.

Of course,

there may be other factors determining the valuation of an exporter such as inventory costs, just in time
production, etc. On average, the price

7 The Role of Endogenous Trade Costs
In this section, we illustrate the importance of endogenous trade costs. In particular, we demonstrate that
the transportation sector (1) implies that net exporters (importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading
to misallocation of productive activities across countries; (2) creates network eects in trade costs; and
(3) dampens the impact of shocks on trade ows. We illustrate these mechanisms, by studying how our
setup compares to one with exogenous iceberg trade costs, the impact of a fuel cost shock and the spatial
propagation of a macro shock (a Chinese slow-down). These mechanisms also shape the policy analysis
considered in the next section.

Exogenous Trade Costs
We begin by showcasing how endogenous trade costs lead to misallocation (mechanism 1) and network
eects (mechanism 2) by comparing our setup to one with exogenous trade costs. Typical trade models
assume that trade costs are iceberg, so that a percentage of the traded good's value is lost in transportation; this percentage is often a function of the distance between the origin and destination (Samuelson,
1954).

In our setup, this amounts to assuming that the price paid for transportation from origin

destination

j

is a function of only the distance,

1/dij ,

and the exporter valuation

r̄ij .

r̄ij .

to

We thus construct

a measure of exogenous trade costs by exibly regressing the observed shipping prices between
distance and

i

i

and

j

on

This ensures that the overall level of shipping prices is the same. We then consider the

trade patterns under these (counterfactual) trade costs, using the exporters' choices, (8) and (9).
Strikingly, we nd that in this world of exogenous iceberg trade costs, trade is substantially less
balanced: trade imbalances are 24% higher on average. Indeed, net exporters experience a 9.4% increase
in their exports, (and up to 24% for Australia), while net importers experience a 4.7% decline in their
exports (and up to 22% for India). In other words, the transportation sector acts as a smoothing factor
for world trade.
The core mechanism is related to the ship's equilibrium behavior and in particular the strength of its
bargaining position. Consider a ship that is located near a large net exporter, such as Brazil. As loading
chances are high, the ship's bargaining position upon meeting an exporter (i.e.

its outside option) is

strong and the ship can extract a high price, which in turn, tends to restrain Brazilian exports compared

to a world with exogenous trade costs.

45 In contrast, consider a ship located near a net importer, such

as India. The ship is unlikely to reload there. This lack of options puts the ship in a weak bargaining
position and forces it to accept lower prices, which in turn increases Indian exports compared to the case

45

In addition, the likely destinations are net importers where ships' value are low. This further increases prices faced by

next exporters like Brazil and dampens exports and trade imbalances.

Neighborhood Imbalance

Figure 6:

Exogenous Trade Costs: the left panel presents the change in exports. The right panel correlates the

of exogenous trade costs. The left panel of Figure 6 presents the change in each region's exporting under
exogenous trade costs and reveals that indeed net exporters experience a disproportionally large increase
in their exports.
This implies that in a world of endogenous trade costs, there is a misallocation of productive activities,
which are reallocated from (ecient) net exporters to (inecient) net importers. In our setup this corresponds to production decreasing in high
increasing in low

r̄/high κ

r̄/low κ

countries which face higher trade costs all else equal and

ones, which face lower trade costs. Indeed, total net value of trade increases

by 10% under exogenous trade costs. In addition, we nd that this argument extends to a region's neighborhood; this is because trade costs depend on the entire network of neighboring countries. Indeed, a net
exporter close to other net exporters oers even more options to ships and prices are even higher, which
inhibits the neighborhood's exports. Hence, a country's own trade imbalance, as well as the imbalance
of its neighborhood, are crucial factors determining its trade disposition. To demonstrate these neighborhood eects, we consider a centrality measure for each region that consists of the weighted sum of trade
imbalance in all regions, where the weights are given by the distance (i.e.

P

j

(1/dij ) (exportsj -importsj )).

The right panel of Figure 6 correlates the change in exports to this centrality measure and shows that the
overall imbalance of a neighborhood matters: regions whose neighborhood is overall a net-exporting one,
oer high outside options to ships, which pushes prices up and thus exports down (and vice versa).

A Shock to Fuel Costs
Here we explore how world trade reacts to a fuel cost shock. This shock directly aects the main (variable)
cost of transportation,

cs , and as a result also changes ship optimal behavior.

This exercise illustrates how

the transport sector dampens the impact of the shock (mechanism 3), while at the same time reallocating

46 , 47

production across countries (mechanism 1).
Consider a 10% decrease in

cs .

The left panel of Figure 7 presents the resulting change in world

exports, while the right panel presents the impact of the shock on several outcomes of interest. A decline
in

cs

has a direct and an indirect eect. The direct eect is straightforward: as costs fall, shipping prices

also fall and thus exports rise.

48 Indeed, we see that exports increase everywhere, on average by 4.4%.

The indirect eect is that the decline in sailing costs lowers the cost of ballasting. This implies that the
ships' outside option,

U,

is now higher, which leads, all else equal, to an increase in prices that dampens

the direct eect (mechanism 3). This is intuitive: reduced sailing costs imply that ships are less tied
to their current region (and indeed ballast miles increase by 17%), and, as their bargaining position is
stronger, they negotiate higher prices. The dampening is substantial: as shown in the second column in
the right panel of Figure 7, if ships were not allowed to optimally adjust their behavior, the increase in
trade would have been 41% higher.
In addition, as fuel costs decline and the importance of the transport sector is reduced, misallocation
declines. Indeed, as shown in the right panel of Figure 7, net exporters experience an increase in exports
of about 5%, while net importers experience an increase of about 3% (mechanism 1). This is largely driven
by the indirect eect: ships ending a trip at net importing regions, are now less likely to wait there given
the lower sailing cost; their outside option is higher and they can command higher prices that further
reduce exports from these regions. Indeed, if ships were not allowed to optimally adjust their behavior,
the increase in the exports of net importing regions would have been more than twice as high.

46
47

For a more detailed analysis of the impact of fuel costs and ship fuel eciency see Brancaccio et al. (2018).
In this and all remaining counterfactuals, we compute the steady state spatial equilibrium distribution of ships and

exporters. In Appendix F, we provide the computational algorithm employed. The use of nonparametric techniques in the
estimation of the matching function may require substantial extrapolation in the counterfactuals; reassuringly, we nd that
the counterfactual matches and ships are always strictly within the range of our data.

48

Formally, there is a direct increase in the surplus of all matches, since now a match between a ship and a freight is more

valuable. Using the ship and freight value functions, the match surplus is given by

Chinese Slow-down
Finally, we explore the spatial propagation of a macro shock: a slow-down in China.

This experiment

showcases how the transport sector creates network eects (mechanism 2), while again misallocating
resources (mechanism 1).
We consider a reduction in the revenue of freights going to China,

r̄i,china ,

by 10%. The left panel of

Figure 8 plots the change in exports, while the right panel collects some statistics. We begin by looking
at China itself. Chinese exports decline by
in

r̄i,china :

11%,

even though they are not directly aected by the change

the entirety of this decline is driven by the transport sector. Indeed, endogenous trade costs

create a complementarity between imports and exports: the high Chinese imports, led to a large number
of ships ending their trip in China and looking for a freight there, which in turn reduced trade costs for
Chinese exporters (mechanism 1).

Therefore, when imports decline, fewer ships end up in China and

Chinese exporters are hurt.
Next, note that, as China is a large importer that trades with multiple countries, world exports naturally decline. Indeed, China's large trading partners, such as Australia, Indonesia and Brazil, experience
a substantial decline in their exports; total exports decline by 11%. However, in addition to this direct
eect, the optimal reallocation of ships over space dierentially lters the shock in neighboring vs. distant
regions (mechanism 2). Even though distant countries, such as Brazil, also experience a decline in exports,
they benet from the reallocation of ships across space. In particular, prior to the shock, a large fraction of

42

the eet was located in the Southeast Pacic region, with ships traveling between China and its neighbors,
mainly Australia and Indonesia. Following the shock, these ships reallocate to other parts of the world,
pushing up exports there all else equal and dampening the overall decline from the direct eect. To see
this, the right panel of Figure 8 shows that if ships were not allowed to optimally adjust their behavior,
the decline in exports for distant countries would have been more than double (e.g.
would have fallen by 21% rather than 9%).

Brazilian exports

This underscores the importance of being close to a large

net importer like China: exporting countries in that pocket of the world, gained not just by directly
exporting to China, but also indirectly from the increased supply of ships in that region.

8 The Role of Maritime Infrastructure
How much do large maritime infrastructure projects contribute to world trade? We use our estimated setup
to address this question by rst evaluating a future project, the Northwest Passage. We then examine the
impact of four natural and man-made passages: the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, Gibraltar and the
Malacca Straits.
The Northwest Passage is a sea route connecting the northern Atlantic and Pacic Oceans through
the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America. This route is not easily navigable due to

49

China's neighbors do not see their exports decline even further, because when Chinese imports decline, ships' outside

options fall everywhere, reducing shipping prices all else equal and dampening the decline in exports (mechanism 3).

43

Arctic sea ice; with global warming and ice thinning, it is likely that the passage will soon be open for
shipping. The opening of the Northwest passage would reduce the distance between East Coast of North
America and the Far East, as well as Northern Europe and the Far East.

Northwest Passage: The left panel presents the change in exports under the opening of the Northwest

passage. In the right panel, the rst column presents the total eect of the opening, while the second column the
direct eect that does not allow ships to optimally adjust their behavior.

To simulate the impact of this new route, we reduce the nautical distance between Northeast America

the resulting change in exports by region, while the right panel collects some statistics.
Not surprisingly, Northeast America sees its exports increase by 8%, while Northern Europe by 1.2%.
Interestingly, exports from China and Japan/S.Korea are only marginally aected (0.3% for Japan, and
-0.1% for China). On one hand, the import-export complementarity pushes exports up; but on the other
hand ballasting is now less costly for ships: when in China or Japan ships can now ballast to the East
Coast of North America more cheaply.

The ships' higher outside option tends to increase prices and

decrease exporting (mechanism 3).
Figure 9 reveals that other countries, not directly aected by the opening of the Northwest Passage,
experience changes in their trade. This illustrates how network eects lead to the propagation of local
shocks (mechanism 2). For instance, Brazil, Northwest America and Australia see their exports fall by
1%, even though none of these countries are directly aected by this passage. Indeed, ships that used to
ballast to these regions now choose to ballast to Northeast America, that experiences a 17% increase in

We calculate this change in travel distance via the Northwest Passage from Ostreng et al. (2013).

Impact of Panama, Suez, Gibraltar and Malacca on world expots. The real and counterfactual maritime

routes among regions are calculated using the Dijkstra's Algorithm. These are combined with ships' average speed
to compute trip duration with and without the corresponding passage.

We also quantify the impact of four existing passages (Panama, Suez, Gibraltar, Malacca) by considering the change in world trade in their absence. These passages reduce nautical distance and thus the
duration of specic trips. Table 8 presents the results. All passages substantially increase world trade.
Removing the Panama Canal leads a decline in world trade of 4%, but up to 32% in the Northeast America. Removing the Suez Canal reduces trade by 3% and up to 26% in the Middle East. Gibraltar seems
to be the most critical one, as removing it would reduce world trade by close to 7% and up to 49% in the
Mediterranean. Finally, removing the Malacca Straits would reduce trade by about almost 2% and up to
11% in Southeast Asia.

9 Conclusion
In this paper we focus on the importance of the transportation sector in world trade. We build a spatial
model where both trade ows and trade costs are equilibrium objects.

Dierent experiments showcase

that the transportation sector unveils a new role for geography through three mechanisms: it misallocates
productive activities, creates network eects and dampens the impact of shocks.

While our empirical

implementation focuses on bulk shipping, similar mechanisms are present in most, if not all, modes of
transportation. We also demonstrate our setup's potential to be used for policy evaluation by considering
the quantitative impact of maritime infrastructure projects, such as the opening of the Northwest Passage.
It is straightforward to use our setup in other counterfactuals, such as taris, trade wars, environmental
regulations and port infrastructure. Finally, embedding our setup within a general equilibrium framework
that endogenizes product prices is an exciting avenue for future research.

Appendix
A Construction of Ship Travel Histories and Searching Ships
Here, we describe the construction of ships' travel histories. The rst task is to identify stops that ships
make using the EE data. A stop is dened as an interval of at least 24 hours, during which (i) the average
speed of the ship is below 5 mph (the sailing speed is between 15 and 20 mph) and, (ii) the ship is located
within 250 miles from the coast. A trip is the travel between two stops.
The second task is to identify whether a trip is loaded or ballast. To do so, we use the ship's draft:
high draft indicates that a larger portion of the hull is submerged and therefore the ship is loaded. The
distribution of draft for a given vessel is roughly bimodal, since as described in Section 2, a hired ship is
usually fully loaded. Therefore, we can assign a high and a low draft level for each ship and consider
a trip loaded if the draft is high (in practice, the low draft is equal to 70% of the high draft). As not all
satellite signals contain the draft information, we consider a trip ballast (loaded) if we observe a signal
of low (high) draft during the period that the ship is sailing. If we have no draft information during the
sailing time, we consider the draft at adjacent stops. Finally, we exclude stops longer than six weeks, as
such stops may be related to maintenance or repairs.
The third and nal task is to rene the origin and destination information provided in the Clarksons
contracts.

Although the majority of Clarksons contracts provide some information on the origin and

destination of the trip, this is often vague (e.g. Far East, Japan-S. Korea-Singapore), especially in the
destinations.

We use the EE data to rene the contracted trips' origins and destinations by matching

each Clarksons contract to the identied stop in EE that is closest in time and, when possible, location.
In particular, we use the loading date annotated on each contract to nd a stop in the ship's movement
history that corresponds to the beginning of the contract. For destinations where information in Clarksons
is noisy we search the ship's history for a stop that we can classify as the end of the contract. In particular,
we consider all stops within a three month window (duration of the longest trip) since the beginning of
the contract. Among these stops we eliminate all those that (i) are in the same country in which the ship
loaded the cargo and (ii) are in Panama, South Africa, Gibraltar or at the Suez canal and in which the
draft of arrival is the same as the draft of departure (to exclude cases in which the ship is waiting to pass
through a strait or a canal). To select the end of the contract among the remaining options we consider
the following possibilities:

46

1. If the contract reports a destination country and if there are stops in this country, select the rst of
these stops as the end of the trip;

2. If the destination country is Japan-S. Korea-Singapore, and if there are stops in either Japan,
China, Korea, Taiwan or Singapore, we select the rst among these as the end of the trip;

3. If the contract does not report a destination country and there are stops in which the ship arrives
full and leaves empty, we select the rst of these as the end of the trip.

We check the performance of the algorithm by comparing the duration of some frequent trips, with
distances found online (at https://sea-distances.org), and nd that durations are well matched.
Next, we turn to the construction of searching ships

Table 9:

Regression of shipping prices on shipowner characteristcs and xed eects.

Shipping prices, ships'

characteristics (age and size), and the identity of the shipowner are obtained from Clarksons.

Information on

shipowner characteristics is obtained from ORBIS. In particular, we match the shipowners in Clarksons to ORBIS;
we do so for two reasons: (i) ORBIS allows us to have reliable rm identities, as shipowners may appear under
dierent names in the contract data; (ii) ORBIS reports additional rm characteristics (e.g. number of employees,
revenue, headquarters). Here we identify the shipowner with the global ultimate owner (GUO); results are robust
to controlling for the identity of the domestic owner (DUO) and the shipowner as reported in Clarksons. Finally,
the data used span the period 2010-2016.

Equation (13) is a direct consequence of (18).
The steady state equations (12) and (13) have a xed point over a properly dened subset of

D Estimation of Ship Costs
Since our model features a number of inter-related value functions (V, U ), it does not fall strictly into the
standard Bellman formulation. Hence, we provide Lemma 2, which proves that our problem is characterized
by a contraction map and thus the value functions are well dened.

Given the choice probabilities Pij (θ), the parameters θ = {

csij cw

i
σ , σ , σ}

satisfy a (I 2 − I) ×

(I 2 + 1) linear system of equations of full rank I 2 − I . Hence, I + 1 additional restrictions are required for

identication.
Proof.

Let

φij =

1
1−β(1−dij ) . The Hotz and Miller (1993) inversion states:

σ log

Pij
= Vij (θ) − βVi (θ)
Pii

Substituting from (2)-(3) we obtain:

σ log

Pij
= −φij csij + βdij φij Vj (θ) − βVi (θ)
Pii

(24)

It also holds that (see Kalouptsidi et al., 2016):

log Pij =

Vij
Ui
−
+ γ euler
σ
σ

or:

σ log Pij = −φij csij + βdij φij Vj (θ) − Ui + σγ euler

(25)

σ log Pii = βVi (θ) − Ui + σγ euler

(26)

and

Now, replace

Vij

from (25) into the denition of

Vi (θ) = −cw
