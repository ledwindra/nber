ABSTRACT
The Right to Education Act in 2009 guaranteed access to free primary education for all children
in India ages 6-14. This paper investigates whether national trends in educational data changed
around the time of this law using household surveys and administrative data. We document four
trends: (1) School-going increases after the passage of RTE, (2) Test scores decline dramatically
after 2010, (3) School infrastructure appears to be improving both before and after RTE, and (4)
The number of students who have to repeat a grade falls precipitously after RTE is enacted, in
line with the official provisions of the law.

Introduction

The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act or Right to Education Act
(RTE) was enacted in August 2009 by the Indian Parliament, mandating free and compulsory
education to all children ages six to fourteen. With RTE now operational, India joined
some 20 other countries including Afghanistan, China and Switzerland which have laws
guaranteeing free and compulsory education for eight years of elementary education (The
Hindu, 2010).
The purpose of such laws is to operationalize the idea of education as a fundamental
human right, though that can mean different things in different countries. In India, the four
most important provisions of the law are: (1) government schools must be completely free
for all children ages 6-14, (2) no student can be expelled or held back before the completion
of primary school (grade 8), (3) twenty-five percent of private school seats must be held for
disadvantaged students in the local area, and (4) infrastructure and quality minimum standards, such as the provision of libraries and girls’ toilets, and minimum teacher qualifications
and pupil-teacher ratios must be implemented.
This paper examines what changes, if any, occurred in the Indian educational system
after the passage of this potentially transformative law. We use three separate nationallyrepresentative datasets to corroborate the findings. We examine changes in student enrollment, test scores, as well as various school characteristics, such as student-teacher ratios
and school infrastructure. We document four important trends in the national data: (1)
School-going increases after the passage of RTE, though this increase is more pronounced
in “primary activity” NSS data than in official enrollment statistics, (2) Test scores decline
dramatically after 2010 in both math and reading, (3) School infrastructure, including pupilteacher ratios, appear to be improving both before and after RTE, and (4) The number of
students who have to repeat a grade falls precipitously after RTE is enacted, in line with
the official provisions of the law.
Though a number of countries have passed laws like RTE around the globe, very little
1

microeconomic analysis exists on the impact of these types of laws. Some of this is likely
due to the fact that these laws are implemented at the country level at one point in time, so
causal analysis is challenging due to a lack of a counterfactual. We face similar constraints
in this paper, and do our best to corroborate findings across various datasets. However we
note that the results in this paper are correlational associations with the passage of RTE
and should not be interpreted as causal.

Data Sources

We use three data sets to investigate changes in educational outcomes in the pre– and
post–RTE world: two household surveys (ASER and NSS) and one administrative data set
collected by the Indian Ministry of Education (DISE).
The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) is a household survey implemented in
almost every rural district in India, and is representative at the district level. We use annual
ASER data from 2005–2014. The survey consists of several questions about the education
of each child, including current enrollment status. We denote a child as enrolled if he or she
reports being “currently enrolled” in school, and zero if he or she reports having dropped
out or has never enrolled in school. ASER also tests each child in the household ages 5–
16 on a total of four basic math and reading skills. Math score ranges from 0-4, where
1 is “can recognize numbers 1-9”, 2 is “can recognize numbers 10-99”, 3 is “can subtract
2-digit numbers” and 4 is “can divide two-digit numbers”. Reading scores range from 0 to
4 where 1 is “can recognize letters”, 2 is “can read words”, 3 is “can read a paragraph” and
4 is “can read a story”. The test scores are constructed as in Shah and Steinberg (2017).
Reading score is measured in the local language. The test is administered to each child in
the household regardless of current school enrollment status and the same test is given to
each child regardless of her age.
The National Sample Survey (NSS) is a nationally representative household survey that
is is conducted on a regular basis by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) which
2

is under the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation of the Government of India.
The NSS gathers nationally representative information on household structure, consumption,
and production. We use data from Schedule 10, Rounds 62, 64, 66, and 68 giving us annual
household data from 2005 to 2012. The survey asks each member of the household for their
primary activity, including children, and we use this to measure school enrollment. We define
a child as attending school if they report their primary activity as “attends school”, and zero
if they report another activity (such as market work, home chores, or being idle).1 In the
main analysis we use both urban and rural households but in the Appendix we show that
the results are robust to the rural sample only to be consistent with ASER data.
The District Information System for Education (DISE) data is a census of schools conducted yearly by the Ministry of Education. This census, aggregated to the state level, is
publicly available for download at udise.in. We use annual data from years 2005-2014.
The census includes variables such as total enrollment numbers by standard (grade) and
type of institution (public or government vs. private), and information about the school,
including infrastructure (i.e. latrines), number of teachers (and their education levels), number of students who repeat a grade, etc. The DISE collects enrollment numbers (not rates),
and while it is purportedly a census of schools, there are some well-known issues with both
completeness and quality of the data.2
We use NSS and DISE data starting in 2005 to remain consistent with the ASER data
(which starts in 2005). There is no NSS Schedule 10 data between 2013-2014 so the last year
of NSS data is 2012. We restrict all analysis to children ages 6 to 16 since RTE is binding
from ages 6 to 14. We include children aged 14-16 as RTE stipulates that children must be
be entitled to free education until the completion of elementary education even after the age
of 14. Table 1 displays the means of all variables of interest by three time periods: pre-RTE
(2004–2008), during RTE transition (2009–2010) and post–RTE (2011-2014).

RTE and Changes in Enrollment

To investigate the changes in educational outcomes before and after RTE, we show a series
of figures that graph βt from the following regression:

Sijt = α + βt · year + γXi + δj + ijt

(1)

where βt is a vector of the coefficients for each year, Xi is a vector of child age and sex
fixed effects, and δj is a vector of district fixed effects. Regressions are clustered at the
district level, and 95% confidence intervals are shown as bars in the figures. The omitted
year is 2008. In the DISE data (which we have at the state level), we include state fixed
effects and cluster at the state level and do not include individual characteristics (Xi ). For
the DISE enrollment Figure 1 (Panel C), we simply graph the total numbers of students
enrolled in each year.
Figure 1 Panel A shows the estimates of the average rates of attending school in the NSS,
while Panel B shows average enrollment rates as measured in the ASER data. It is worth
noting that these two variables are not measuring the exact same thing: from 2004-2008,
85% of children ages 6-16 in the NSS report attending school as their primary activity, while
93% of children ages 6-16 report being currently enrolled in school in ASER. In addition,
enrollment (in ASER) is likely to have a lagged effect, because children will report being
enrolled in school even if they no longer attend, until the new school year begins.
The NSS data shows a clear increase in the rate of attending school after 2008 (5 percentage points in 2010), which is sustained until 2012 without much of a pre-trend before
2008. ASER data shows a much smaller increase (1 percentage point in 2010), though there
is a similar increase between 2006 and 2007, prior to the enactment of RTE. Using the raw
DISE data, panel C shows total enrollment numbers per 10,000 students by year in India.
As in ASER, there appears to be an increase in enrollment numbers in 2010, though enrollment is increasing sharply before RTE is implemented, so the effect of RTE (separate from

4

underlying trends) is less clear. In Figure A1 we restrict the NSS and DISE sample to rural
areas only (to be consistent with the ASER data), and the results for the NSS look fairly
similar while the DISE enrollment increase is smaller in the rural sample.
Figure A2 shows the same plots, broken up roughly by primary and secondary age children. Panels A and B separate by age, while Panel C separates by grade, due to data
constraints in the DISE. In all three panels, it is clear that the increases in schooling in
Figure 1 appear to be driven by the older children (ages 13-16 or upper primary). In Figure
A3 we show that the increase in enrollment seems to be driven by private schools but the
underlying trends (increase in private and decrease in government enrollment) make it difficult to attribute this change to the RTE. In Figure A4 we plot the enrollment changes by
quartile of enrollment in 2008. The largest increases are coming from areas that had lower
enrollment in 2008.
Table A1, Panel A shows the enrollment results for each dataset from a regression identical
to the one above, but with a single “post-2008” dummy replacing the vector of year fixed
effects. In all three data sets, enrollment increases significantly after 2008. Enrollment
increases from approximately 1-1.5 percent (ASER and DISE) to 7 percent (NSS) in the
post-RTE period. Panel B shows results by gender using the NSS and ASER data. In both
datasets, the magnitude of the change in enrollment is larger for girls (Panel B).

4

RTE and Changes in Test Scores and School Quality

Next, we examine the potential effect of RTE on test scores in Figure 2. Interestingly we see
both math and reading scores drop sharply in 2011, two years post–RTE. The scores drop
again in 2012 and then remain at that lower level through 2014, the last year in our data.
The results in Panel C of Table A1 suggest that math test scores drop by about 25% of
a standard deviation, and reading drops by about 10% of a standard deviation post–RTE.
This is a large effect, comparable in magnitude to some of the most successful educational
interventions in this context (Banerjee et al., 2007). The timing of the effect comes after the
5

increase in enrollment, which is not surprising, since test scores might represent a stock of
knowledge gained in the previous year(s). One might be worried that the test scores results
are being driven by a changing composition of students taking the test. Figure 2 includes
only children who are currently enrolled in school, but Figure A5 in the Appendix includes
all children (currently and never enrolled and dropped out). Both figures are surprisingly
similar suggesting that compositional changes in children are not driving the decrease in test
scores.
To understand these changes in enrollment and test scores, we turn to the aspects of
schooling that might be associated with RTE. If enrollment is increasing and school capacity is not, this might crowd classrooms and increase student-teacher ratios. RTE at least
nominally required schools to decrease pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools to less than 40
(less than 30 in most schools), and to provide infrastructure such as gender-specific toilets
and libraries (KPMG, 2016). In Figure 3, we show estimates from regressions using DISE
data on four measures of school quality/infrastructure: number of schools with girls toilet
facilities, student–teacher ratios, teacher education (high school and below vs above high
school), and the number of student repeaters. Again we graph the coefficients on the year
dummies with their respective confidence intervals. All regressions include state fixed effects
and are clustered at the state level. In Panels A-C, broadly speaking, school quality seems to
be improving over time by all three measures. It is not clear how much of this improvement
is due to RTE, since all three measures are trending “better” both before and after RTE,
but it at least appears that RTE does not reduce school quality to the extent that we can
measure it. This is consistent with Muralidharan et al. (2017) who also show substantial
improvements in input-based measures of school quality during this period in India.

Discussion & Conclusion

The changes in enrollment, test scores, and school quality measures should be interpreted
cautiously. Though some changes appear to coincide with the passage of RTE, this paper is
6

not designed to provide causal estimates of the law on educational outputs.
However, if we assume at least some of the test score drop is due to RTE, our results
present a bit of a puzzle. Enrollment seems to be increasing moderately over this time, while
test scores are decreasing. The natural explanation for this would be overcrowding: more
students increase classroom size and this decreases learning. However Figure 3 (Panels A
and B), show that the student-teacher ratio is decreasing during this period so schools are
hiring more teachers and teacher education is increasing. To the extent that we can measure
infrastructure and resources per student, they seem to be getting better, not worse.
There are several alternative explanations that could help to explain this pattern. First, a
large component of the RTE was designed to subsidize the entry of historically disadvantaged
students into private schools. This might have changed the composition of students in both
public and private schools (Hsieh and Urquiola, 2006), and this change could have led to
changing pedagogical strategies in some private schools with large influxes of lower-ability
students (Neilson, 2017; Bau, 2017). In addition, the influx of out-of-school students into
schools could have caused negative peer effects in government schools. In Figure A6 we
show the test score decline by public (government) and private schools using the ASER
data. We observe that the decrease is happening in both types of schools, though it is larger
in government public schools. Muralidharan et al. (2017) argue that teacher absenteeism
actually worsens with decreased pupil-teacher ratios in India, and indeed, in Figure A7 we
see a modest increase in teacher absenteeism over this time period.3
The other aspect of RTE that seems most likely to have lowered test scores is the lack of
testing and universal promotion of students in primary school. We observe that the overall
number of repeaters is decreasing quite significantly during this time period (Panel D, Figure
3). It is possible that this “social passing” leads to decreased learning for students who are
not prepared for upper-level courses, worsening the problem of instructional mismatch in
Indian classrooms (Muralidharan et al., forthcoming; Duflo et al., 2011; Bau, 2017). It is
3
The data from this figure comes from the ASER school survey, which is available in fewer pre-RTE years
and, while a large sample, is not representative of Indian schools.

7

also possible that the lack of high-stakes testing itself decreases the incentives for learning
for both teachers and students (Banerjee and Duflo, 2018).
These explanations are not exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive. Whatever the
reason, it is clear that test scores have declined sharply in India since 2011, two years after
the passage of RTE. We leave it to future research to conduct a more careful study of the
mechanisms that may have caused this decline and how much is related to RTE.

of enrollment or school attendance from three seperate data sources. “Attends school” is equal to one if the child lists attending
school as his or her primary activity, and zero if he or she lists another primary activity. “Enrolled” is equal to one if the child
reports being enrolled in school, and zero if he reports having dropped out or never enrolled. “Log Enrollment” is the natural
logarithm of the total state enrollment of children in primary and upper primary school. Columns 1 and 2 contain district, age,
and sex fixed effects, and are limited to children aged 6-16. Column 3 contains state fixed effects. Panel B shows enrollment by
gender. Columns 1 and 3 are identical to Panel A, but add an interaction of post-2008 with female. Column 3 reports the log
of total female enrollment by state. The dependent variables in Panel C are test scores, where math and read score range from
0-4. The Right to Education Act was passed in 2009, though not fully implemented until 2010. Standard errors, clustered at
the district level for all regressions except Panel A column C and Panel B column C, clustered at the state level, are shown in
parentheses. ∗ 10% significance ∗∗ 5% significance ∗∗∗ 1% significance.
