Stock Prices and Economic News
ABSTRACT

This paper examines the daily response of stock prices to announcements
about the money supply, inflation, real economic activity, and the discount

rate. Except for the discount rate, survey data on market participants'
expectations of these announcements are used to identify the unexpected
component of the announcements in order to test the efficient markets

hypothesis that only the unexpected part of any announcement, the surprise,

moves stock prices. The empirical results support this hypothesis and
indicate further that surprises related to monetary policy significantly

affect stock prices. There is only limited evidence of an impact from
inflation surprises and no evidence of an impact from real activity surprises

on the announcement days. There is also only weak evidence of stock price
responses to surprises beyond the announcement day.

STOCK PRICES AND ECONOMIC NEWS

I. INTRODUCTION
The interpretation of daily stock price movements as reactions to
announcements of economic events is commonplace in the media. Commentators
often report that stock prices fell because of "disappointing unemployment

figures" or rose because of "encouraging news on the inflation front." There
has been, however, little systematic evidence on the quantitative impact on

stock prIces of such announcements. One obstacle to research in this area is
the difficulty in distinguishing that part of an announcement which was

unanticipated. According to the efficient markets hypothesis, security prices
should only respond to the unexpected part of any announcement, i.e., that
part which is truly news, since the expected part of the announcement should

already be embedded in stock prices. In addition, this hypothesis maintains
that the full response of stock prices to news will occur essentially

immediately. This paper employs survey data on market participants'
expectations of certain economic announcements to investigate whether the
evidence supports the efficient markets view.
Previous studies of the effects of economic announcements on stock
prices generally provide little direct evidence on the validity of the

efficient markets theory. While Fama et al. (1969) conclude that the
information contained in stock splits is rapidly incorporated into stock
prices, they cannot distinguish expected from unexpected splits and their use
of monthly data prevents them from investigating the precise timing within

which information is processed. Waud (1970) finds a significant and immediate
negative response of stock prices to discount rate changes but he does not
test whether the complete response takes more than one day.!'

Castanias

—2—

(1979) reports that the variance of stock prices rises around the days of most
economic news events which he interprets as a reflection of new information

appearing. Again) however) expected and unexpected announcements are not
differentiated since Castanias simply uses dummy variables for the days of the

announcements. Schwert (1981) examines the stock market reaction to the
monthly CPI inflation rate announcement and does use a measure of unexpected

inflation rather than just the announced rate. Schwert's results contradict
the efficient markets hypothesis since they imply a slow adjustment of share

prices to new information on inflationL/ On the other hand, Pearce and Roley
(1983) find that the response of stock prices to the weekly money stock
announcement is consistent with the efficient markets theory since only the
unexpected money stock change had a significant effect and this effect was

complete within the trading day after the announcement./
This paper extends our previous study by including measures of agents'
expectations of monthly inflation and real activity announcements along with

anticipated money announcements. Fortunately, survey data exist on market
participants' expectations of these economic announcements so that direct

measures of the unexpected changes or surprises can be constructed. These
data run from September 1977 through October 1982 thereby allowing tests of
the interesting question of whether the stock market's reactions to economic
news changed after the Federal Reserve altered its operating procedure in
October 1979.

Section II outlines the theoretical framework of the study. Section III
describes the data along with tests of the rationality of the expectations

variables. Section IV presents the empirical results of market efficiency
tests while the final section gives the main conclusions.

II. Theoretical Framework

In this section, the specifications used to estimate the impact of new

economic information on stock prices is presented. Following the
specification of the model, possible links between stock prices and new
information about the money stock, inflation, output, and the Federal
Reserve's

discount

rate are discussed.

A. The Model

LSPta+xt%+et

(3)

and the data should not reject equation (3) in favor of equation (1). The
remainder of this section discusses the elements of xt" considered in this
paper in terms of their potential effects on stock prices.

B. Impact of Money Stock Surprises
A number of recent studies——including those by Grossman (1981), Tirich

and Wachtel (1981), Roley (1982), Cornell (1983a) and Pearce and Roley
(1983)——have examined the impact of the weekly money stock announcement on

security returns. The consensus finding is that unexpectedly high money
growth is associated with higher interest rates and lower stock prices.J
There are, however, two competing interpretations of this result. First,
agents may believe that the Federal Reserve will react to unexpectedly high
money growth by quickly moving to a more restrictive monetary policy which

would lead to higher interest rates. The anticipation of higher rates in the
near future causes agents to sell securities immediately, forcing interest

rates upward. Higher interest rates then lead to lower stock prices, assuming

investors view these assets as substitutes.J In this view, unexpectedly high
money growth causes real interest rates to rise. The second interpretation is
that agents revise upwards their expectations of inflation when a positive

money announcement surprise occurs. Higher expected inflation both pushes up
nominal interest rates through the Fisher effect and pulls down stock prices
if inflation has a negative effect on real, after—tax corporate profits (e.g.,
Feldstejn (1980) and Summers (1981)).

—5—

C. Impact of Inflation Surprises
Another much publicized economic announcement is the monthly report on

the rate of inflation measured in the previous month.V Inflation surprises
may have both direct and indirect effects on stock prices.i A direct effect
could emerge if a positive surprise in announced inflation induces agents to

raise their level of expected inflation. Higher expected inflation, as
mentioned above, could then depress stock prices.
A second direct channel by which inflation surprises may affect stock
prices occurs if agents believe that policymakers react to inflation news.
Unexpectedly high inflation may lead to more restrictive policies which in

turn lead to reduced cash flows for firms and lower stock prices. Similar to
this channel, if a positive inflation surprise causes agents to revise upward
their assessment of future money demand, higher interest rates and lower stock
prices may result if agents further expect the Federal Reserve to maintain its

previous monetary growth objectives. In any event, all of these potential
links suggest that stock prices may be negatively related to surprises in
announced measures of inflation.
D. Impact of Output Surprises
A third economic announcement considered is the monthly report on real

activity in the previous month. Announced increases in real economic
activity, if greater than expected, may increase agents' expectations of

future growth. Forecasts of higher economic growth should make stocks more
attractive and thus cause an immediate jump in share prices.
Alternatively, announced output surprises may again cause agents to
forecast more restrictive policy in the future if such surprises are

correlated with future inflation or money growth. In this case, if the public
perceives that the Federal Reserve will not accommodate these increases,

—6—

interest rates may rise and stock prices may fall. As a result, the likely
impact of output surprises on stock prices cannot be determined a Tpriori.

E. Discount Rate Changes
The fourth economic announcement is a change in the Federal Reserve's

discount rate. Unlike the other three types of announcements, a survey
measure of expected discount rate changes is not available. Empirical
evidence discussed in the next section, however, indicates that it is
reasonable to view discount rate changes as unanticipated, at least in terms
of timing and perhaps also in terms of magnitude.
Waud (1970), among others, argued that discount rate changes have

announcement effects concerning monetary policy. In a recent study by Rolev
and Troll (1984), empirical evidence suggested that these announcement effects
are associated with changes in short—run monetary policy objectives, and not

changes in trend money growth. An increase in the discount rate, for example,
corresponds to a short—run objective of returning to the implied long—run

money growth target more quickly. As a result, market interest rates rise,

reflecting reduced short—run money growth. Since long—run money growth
objectives are unchanged, there are no offsetting effects due to possible

reductions in expected future inflation. Thus, if stock prices are affected
by discount rate increases, they should fall in response to the rise in market
interest rates.

The information content of discount rate changes also was found by Roley
and Troll (1984) to depend on the type of operating procedure adopted by the

Federal Reserve. Under the reserves—aggregate procedure utilized during the
three years following October 6, 1979, discount rate changes revealed new

information about short—run policy objectives as described above. Under the
federal funds rate procedure used prior to October 1979, however, significant

—7—

information was not revealed by discount rate changes. In this latter case,
movements in the federal funds rate conveyed changes in short—run objectives

directly. Thus, the response of stock prices may be different in the pre— and
post—October 1979 periods.

To summarize, four economic news events are considered: announcements
on the money stock, inflation, real activity, and the discount rate. As
described above, unanticipated increases in money, inflation, and the discount
rate may be viewed as bad news for the stock market and thus should be

followed by a fall in stock prices. Unexpectedly strong real growth may be
viewed as good news with stock prices rising as a result, unless future policy

is assessed as being more restrictive. If the stock market is efficient, any
response will be essentially immediate.

III. DATA
The data for stock prices, economic data announcements, and expected

values of economic data announcements are discussed in this section. Because
of the important role of expectations, the expectations data are examined in

detail. The sample period used in this paper begins on September 29, 1977,

and ends on October 15, 1982. The starting date corresponds to the
availability of the survey data used to represent expectations, and the ending
date is around the time that the Federal Reserve de—emphasized the reserve—
aggregate monetary control procedure.

A. Stock Prices
To estimate the response of stock prices to new information, daily

changes in an index of closing stock prices are used. For economic
announcements occurring either before or while the stock market is open, the
previous business day's cløsing prices are subtracted from the closing prices

on that day. For announcements occurring after the stock market is closed,

—8--

that day's closing stock prices are subtracted from the next business day's

closing prices. These measured changes give the market ample opportunity to
reflect the receipt of new information. The possibility that the effect of
new information persists beyond one day is, however, also tested below. The
particular stock index employed is the Standard and Poor's 500 index (S&P500).
Thus, the dependent variable is the daily percentage change of closing values
of the S&P500..V

B. Announcement Data
The money stock data consist of announced weekly changes in the narrowly

defined money stock as reported in the Federal Reserve's H.6 release. A
reported change corresponds to the estimate of the level of the money stock
for the statement week ending on Wednesday of the previous calendar week minus
the revised estimate of the previously reported level of the money stock.

Until January 31, 1980, the data used here correspond to announced changes in

"old Ml" on Thursdays at 4:10 p.m. Since then, the announcements have been

made on Fridays at 4:10 p.m. For the period, the data employed are those for
Mi—B, and more recently, Ml, where the definition of the latter aggregate is
equivalent to that of Ml—BJ..2/

The inflation data correspond to percentage changes in the consumer
price index (cPi) and the producer price index (PPI), as initially announced

by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In each case, values were released monthly
on various days of the week, and they provide information about inflation
during the preceding month.
Data on industrial production (IP) and the unemployment rate (RU) are

used to represent real economic activity. The industrial production data
correspond to the percentage changes announced initially by the Federal

Reserve. Similarly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' initial release of the

—9--

unemployment rate is used. While data on the industrial production index were
released on various days of the week, the unemployment rate was usually
released on the first Friday of each month.

Discount rate changes correspond to the initial announcement of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regarding a new level of the

discount rate. In some instances, the change in the discount rate did not
become effective on the same day for all Federal Reserve banks. However,
differentials in the discount rate did not usually persist beyond one business

day. In the post—October 1979 period, announced changes in the surcharge rate
also are considered.

C. Expectations Data
To estimate the impact of economic news, the efficient markets
hypothesis implies that only the unanticipated components of economic

announcements should be used. Some measure of the market's expectation must
be obtained to form these unanticipated components. A convenient source of
these expectations data is that provided by Money Market Services, Inc., which

surveys about 60 money market participants each week.!!! Before February 8,

1980, surveys were conducted twice each week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The
Thursday surveys were conducted to obtain a revised estimate of the money

announcement. Other prospective announcements were not generally resurveyed

on Thursday. After February 8, 1980, the survey was conducted only on
Tuesdays. Following Roley (1983), the survey data were adjusted in both
periods in an effort to incorporate new information avai1able from the time of

the survey to the time of the respective economic announcement.!a/ Because
the adjusted data did not yield significantly different empirical results,
however, only the results using the unadjusted survey data are reported here.

—10-

With the exception of discount rate announcements, survey data are

available for all of the announcements considered here. For the discount
rate, the entire announced change is assumed to be unanticipated. Discount
rate changes have, however, sometimes been interpreted as merely reflecting
past movements in short—term market interest rates (e.g., Lombra and Torto

(1977)). The underlying hypothesis in this case is that the discount rate is
changed to realign it with the Federal funds rate. Roley and Troll (1984)
examine this hypothesis by regressing daily movements in the discount rate——
which are zero unless a discount rate change is announced-—on the cumulative
change in the federal funds rate since the last discount rate announcement.
In both the pre— and post—October 1979 periods, less than 2 percent of the

variation in discount rate changes is explained. Thus, information about past
values of the federal funds rate has very limited usefulness in predicting the
exact timing, and perhaps also the magnitude, of discount rate changes.

To examine the expectations data for the other economic announcements,

three tests are performed. First, the unbiasedness of the survey data is
examined in Table 1. If the survey data are rational, no systematic bias
should be evident. The test results indicate that unbiasedness cannot be
rejected at the 5 percent level of significance for all of the data except

those for expected values of industrial production announcements. In this
latter case, the survey measure is downward biased in absolute value, as

reflected by the estimated value of f1J.J
Second, the efficiency of the survey expectations measure is tested in

Table 2. Following Modigliani and Shiller (1973), the basic notion behind
this concept is that if announced data are generated by an autoregressive
process, the market's expectation should be generated by the same process.
Thus, coefficients on lagged values of announced data in a regression with the

—11—

unanticipated component of an announcement should be insignificantly different

from zeroJ../ As indicated in the table, the null hypothesis cannot be
rejected at low significance levels for any of the survey dataJ...J

Finally, the forecast performances of the survey data are compared to

those of autoregressive models in Table 3. In estimating the autoregressive
models, the number of lagged values was determined by the statistical
significance of the lag coefficients and the properties of the residuals.

Because the autoregressive models are estimated over the entire forecast
period, their root—mean—square errors (RNSE) are actually understated.

Nevertheless, the survey data have lower root—mean—square errors than the

simple autoregressive modelsJif
As a whole, the survey data used here exhibit desirable properties,

especially in comparison to other survey dataJii Thus, these data enable
direct tests of the efficient markets hypothesis.

IV. RESPONSE OF STOCK PRICES: ENPIRICAL RESULTS
A. Initial Responses to Announcements
Using the expectations data described above, the impact of both
anticipated and unanticipated components of economic announcements on the

daily percentage change in stock prices is estimated. The most general
specification is represented by equation (1). Various subcases of equation

(1)—determined by the constraints

9.

or

=

9.——are estimated over the two

subsainpies discussed previously.

The estimated response of stock prices to announcement surprises is

presented in Table 4. Due to their lack of statistical significance, the
reported equations do not include day—of—the—week dummy variables. In both
the pre— and post—October 1979 subsamples, the hypothesis that all day—of—the—
week effects are equal could not be rejected at the 5 percent level of

—12—

significanceJ../ Moreover, the presence or absence of day—of—the—week dummy

variables

had virtually no effect on the empirical results reported below.

In the pre—October 1979 period, the estimation results indicate that

only money and PPI surprises affect stock prices significantly. In both
cases, the response is negative as anticipated. The estimated coefficients
imply that a $1 billion money surprise causes stock prices to fall by about
0.9 percent and that a 1 percentage point surprise in the PPI results in a

decline in stock prices of about 1.09 percent. Surprises in announced values
of the CPI, industrial production, the unemployment rate, and the discount
rate are statistically unrelated to stock prices during this period, at least

on announcement daysjil
In the post—October 1979 period, the impact of money surprises is again
statistically significant, but the impact of PPI surprises is not

significantly different from zero. During this subsample, however, the impact
of changes in the basic discount rate is significant at the 5 percent level,
and the effect of changes in the surcharge rate is significant at the 10

percent level. No other announcement surprises are estimated to have
significant effects during this period.

The statistical significance of various subsets of coefficients is

examined in the lower half of Table 4. In the first row, the hypothesis that
all response coefficients equal zero is tested for the two subsamples. This
hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 10 percent level of significance in the
pre—October 1979 subsample, but it can be rejected at less than the 1 percent

level in the post—October 1979 subsample. In the second row, the significance
of inflation and real activity surprises are examined as a group. The
hypothesis that this set of variables has no impact on stock prices cannot be

rejected at the 10 percent level in each period. In contrast, the hypothesis

—13—

that money and discount rate surprises have insignificant effects, as reported
in the third row, can be rejected at less than the 1 percent level in each

subsample. As a whole, these results suggest that surprises related directly
to monetary policy have the main effects on stock prices, at least on the days
of the announcements.

The last row in Table 4 examines the response of stock prices to

anticipated announced values of economic data. Under the efficient markets
hypothesis, these expectations should already be reflected by stock prices and

therefore should not further affect daily changes. In both the pre— and post—
October 1979 periods, this hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 10 percent

level of significance. Thus, the results reported in the table are consistent
with the efficient markets hypothesis.

One final issue, not reported in Table 4, also was empirically examined.
In particular, the equality of stock price responses across the pre— and post—

October 1979 periods were tested. Consistent with the results reported by
Pearce and Roley (1983), no significant difference between either sets of
coefficients or individual responses was found across periods.2.Q/ This result
again is in sharp contrast to the significant change in the response of both
short— and long—term interest rates to new information following the Federal
R.eserves adoption of the reserves—aggregate operation procedure on October 6,
1979 (see, for example, Roley and Troll (1983) and Cornell (1983a)).

B. Speed of Stock Price Adjustment
In order to investigate whether the effect of new information on stock
prices persists beyond one business day, the model was reestiiuated using four

alternative dependent variables.2JJ For example, the first (tSP1) is the
percentage change in the S&P500 from the first closing quotes to the closing

quotes in the subsequent day. The second (SP2) is the percentage change in

—14—
stock prices in the next day calculated in the same manner with SP3 and SP4
having corresponding definitions. Thus, the response of stock prices over the
four business days following an economic announcement is examined.

The estimated models for each subsample are presented in Table 5. In
the pre—October 1979 subsample, only one out of a possible 24 response

coefficients is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. In
particular, the PPI surprise is estimated to affect stock prices significantly

in the fourth day following its announcement. The stock price response also

Table 4.

In the post—October 1979 subsample, four out of a possible 28 response

coefficients are statistically significant at the 5 percent level. In the day
following an announced change in the discount rate, stock prices are estimated

to continue to fall (rise) for a discount rate increase (decrease). For the
surcharge rate, however, the initial announcement effect is offset in the

subsequent business day, The results also suggest that positive (negative)
industrial production surprises have significantly positive (negative) effects

on stock prices in the second day following their announcement. Finally, in
the fourth day following an announcement of a change in the surcharge, the
estimated stock price response is again significantly negative.
Because of the number of coefficients estimated in Table 5, the
statistical significance of any small set of coefficients should be

interpreted cautiously. In particular, only 5 out of a possible 52 estimated
coefficients are statistically significant at either the 5 or 10 percent

levels, which may be expected even if no actual relationship exists. Thus,
the empirical results in Table 5 do not provide strong evidence that stock
prices in some instances respond slowly or even move to offset initial

—15--

announcement effects. It is interesting to note, nevertheless, that in
contrast to Schwert (1981) CPI surprises are not found to have significant

effects on stock prices in days following announcements. Also, the response
to money surprises is estimated to be complete within the day of an
announcement, which is consistent with the results reported by Pearce and
Roley (1983) using the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper has examined the daily response of stock prices to
announcements of the narrowly defined money stock, the CPI, the PPI, the
unemployment rate, industrial production, and the Federal Reserve's discount

rate. To represent the new information provided by an announcement, a measure
of the market's expectation is ised. Several conclusions follow from this

empirical investigation. First, new information related directly to monetary
policy significantly affects stock prices. In particular, money announcement
surprises have a significantly negative effect on stock prices in the sample

period beginning in September 1977 and ending in October 1982. In the
subsample beginning in October 1979, discount rate changes also have

significant effects. Second, only limited evidence supports the view that
either inflation or real economic activity surprises affect stock prices. In
the pre—October 1979 subsample, PPI surprises have significant effects on the
day of an announcement, but they are estimated to be offset by the end of one

week, In both aubsamples, surprises in announced levels of real economic
activity have no significant impact on stock prices on the day of an

announcement. Third, the empirical results indicate that anticipated
components of economic announcements do not significantly affect daily stock
price movements, which is consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis.
Finally, some evidence is presented which suggests that the response of stock

—16—

prices to new information may persist beyond the announcement day, although
for most economic announcements this is not found.

ii Waud reports evidence indicating that the market anticipated discount rate

declines. As he notes, however, his sample contains discount rate changes
which were not simultaneous at all regional Federal Reserve Banks while his
analysis focused on New York Federal Reserve Bank discount rate announcements.
This may account for the apparent ability of the market to predict discount
rate changes.

i Using daily stock returns, Schwert reports that CPI surprises have no
effects on the day of the announcement, but have significant effects from one

to five days following the announcement. His sample period begins in January
1955 and ends in December 1978. Schwert's preferred measure of the expected
CPI announcement is estimated from the Treasury bill yield. He also uses a
simple autoregressive model analogous to that examined below in Section III,
and he reports that the two measures yield the same results.

1/ Berkman (1978) finds similar results to Pearce and Roley using a different
measure of unanticipated money stock changes. Niederhoffer (1971) detects a
response of stock prices to world events as measured by newspaper headlines.
Lloyd—Davies and Caves (1978) report that individual stocks react immediately
to the Wail- Street- Journa-1 recommendations while Arbél and Jaggi (1982)

conclude that the market is efficient from their evidence that large stock
price movements——their proxy for new information——are not typically followed
by abnormal movements.
.fi/

Following Gibbons and Hess (1981), day—of—the—week dummy variables also

were included in some of the estimated equations. The significance of these
dummies, as well as their effect on the estimation and test results, are
discussed in Section IV.

—24—

The discussion in this and subsequent sections is usually in terms of

positive surprises. Symmetry is, however, assumed.

/ The bond market remains open after the money announcement while the stock
market has already closed. Thus, interest rates are known to be higher (after
a positive money surprise) when the stock market opens on the next business
day.

11 See Schwert (1981) for a careful treatment of the CPI announcement.

/ For discussion of analogous effects of inflation and output on interest
rates, see Roley and Troll (1983) and Cornell (1983b).

2] In an earlier study (Pearce and Roley (1983)), the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA) was used to enable the response of stock prices to money
announcements to be measured from the market's close to the market's opening.
Because of the variety of different types of announcements considered here,
and the different times they occur throughout the day, closing prices of a
broader index are used in this analysis.

kQ/ Announced changes in Mi—B are analyzed here because of the emphasis
placed on Mi—B by Federal Reserve policyinakers and market participants. It
should also be noted that the Mi—B data for 1981 are not the shift—adjusted

Mi—B figures which reflect the introduction of nationwide NOW accounts. While
the Federal Reserve's target range was in terms of shift—adjusted 141—B, weekly

announced changes were not shift adjusted.

UI We are indebted to Raul A. Nicho, vice president with Money Market
Services, for making the survey data available for this project.

UI To adjust the survey measure, new information was assumed to be reflected
by the percentage change in closing itock prices from the day of the survey to

the market's latest close prior to the announcement. Announced values of the
data were then regressed on the market survey measure and this percentage

— 25—

change in stock prices. The fitted values from this regression formed the
revised expectation of the economic announcements.

All tests reported in Tables 1, 2, and 3 also were performed separately

for the pre— and post—October 1979 periods. The unbiasedness of the survey
measure for industrial production announcements cannot be rejected at the 5
percent level in the pre—October 1979 subsample, but this hypothesis can be

rejected in the post—October 1979 subsample. The only other difference
between the results reported in Table 1 and those for the pre— and post—

October 1979 subsample involves expected values of money announcements. In
this case, unbiasedness can be rejected at the 5 percent level of significance
in the pre—October 1979 subsample due to a statistically significant constant
term.

If

relevant variables are excluded from the information set, this test is

still valid because the bias will be the same in each autoregression under the

null hypothesis. Also note that the single—equation efficiency test specified
here is equivalent to testing the hypothesis that data announcement surprises

are uncorrelated with previously announced values of the data. For other
applications of the efficiency test, see Pesando (1975) and Friedman (1980).

iJ This

same result also holds for the pre— and post—October 1979

subsamples.

11]

In

the pre—October 1979 subsample, the autoregressive model has a

somewhat lower root—mean—square error for unemployment rate announcements.
Again, the results from the autoregressive model are downward biased.
121

For an analysis of the Livingston inflation survey data, see, for

example, Pesando (1975), Mullineaux (1978), and Pearce (1979). For an
analysis of the Goldsmith—Nagan interest rate survey data, see Friedman
(1980).

The F—statistics were F(4,501) = 2.0455 and F(4,751) = 1.2998 with
marginal significance levels of .0869 and .2685 for the pre— and post—October

1979 subsamples, respectively. In the pre—October 1979 subsample, the Friday
dummy bad a positive and statistically significant coefficient, while all
other estimated coefficients were insignificantly different from zero.

121 For CPI surprises, Schwert (1981) also found statistically insignificant
stock price responses on announcement days, but not on days either before or
after announcement days.

2.21 The most significant F—statistic was obtained for the response of stock
prices to PPI surprises.

In this case, the F—statistic has a value of

F(1,1262) = 1.5903 with a marginal significance level of .2075.

211 This procedure is analogous to estimating the j
(1).
