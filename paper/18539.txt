The Political Economy of Government Revenues in Post-Conflict Resource-Rich Africa: Liberia
and Sierra Leone

NBER Working Paper No. 18539
November 2012
JEL No. O11
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the post-war strategies of Liberia and Sierra Leone to generate revenues from
their natural resources. We document the challenges faced by the government of the two countries,
contrasting measures taken to address these challenges as well as the outcomes. We complement the
analysis with an analytical model which explores the implications of exploiting natural resources in
the aftermath of a civil conflict before public management institutions are developed, as observed
in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The key lesson is that resource-rich countries emerging from conflict
face a difficult trade-off between relatively large longer-term gains which accrue when institutional
capacity is developed prior to exploiting the resources, and smaller short-term revenues that come
with immediate exploitation of the resources. The findings call attention to the potential role of the
international community in developing post-conflict countries’ natural resource and revenue institutional
capacity, as well as transparent corporate and government institutions for resource management.

1. Introduction
Liberia and Sierra Leone have been hailed as success stories of political transition from civil
war in Africa, having emerged from it as budding democracies. Sierra Leone has had two
peaceful postwar elections, the second of which was won by the opposition, while Liberia
has elected Africa’s first female president. However, at the end of the war, the two countries
faced the daunting challenge of resuscitating collapsed government revenues to help finance
the peacebuilding and reconstruction process. Government revenues plummeted in Liberia
from around US$240 million just before war onset in 1989 to about US$46 million at the
onset of peace in 2003, and in Sierra Leone from 17% of GDP in the 1970s to around 12%
at the end of the 1991-2001 civil war.
Natural resources were a key element of the revenue challenges facing Liberia and Sierra
Leone. Both countries are endowed with a variety of natural resources with considerable
scope for revenue generation. However, the resources sometimes played a pernicious role in
the economy before the war and helped to fuel the conflict in the two countries. In wartime
Liberia, the warlord Charles Taylor presided over commerce in gold, timber and rubber
(Reno 1998). Taylor godfathered an arms-for-diamonds trade with the Sierra Leone rebels
(UN 2000), prompting UN sanctions on export of diamonds and timber from Liberia.4 In
pre-war Sierra Leone, diamonds were at the epicenter of a thriving underground economy
with the bulk of the diamonds smuggled abroad. The diamond mines attracted thousands
of young quasi-criminal illicit diggers, generating a recruitment base and financing for the
rebellion (Reno 1998, Smillie et al 2000). Thus, natural resources posed risks to the peace
process while oﬀering considerable scope for revenue generation in post-war Liberia and
Sierra Leone.
The objective of this paper, therefore, is to examine and draw lessons from the strategies adopted by Liberia and Sierra Leone to generate revenues from their natural resources.

Charles Taylor is currently standing trial in The Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity
for his role in the Sierra Leone civil war.

As part of the analysis, we develop an analytical model to illuminate the revenue challenges
facing a resource-rich country emerging from conflict. We find that after the war, despite
weak resource management capacity, the governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone initiated
the process of exploiting their natural resources, oﬀering large fiscal concessions. In Sierra
Leone the government argued that generous fiscal concessions were necessary to attract
foreign investors to a high risk environment. However, the fiscal concessions that both
countries oﬀered were often perceived to be overly generous, while in Liberia, the government revealed a preference for initial payments seemingly at the expense of longer-term
benefits. Concerns endure that, despite revisions, some current exploitation contracts still
oﬀer overly generous fiscal concessions to exploiting companies. Moreover, fiscal terms vary,
creating an uneven playing field which could discourage investment and distort incentives
towards lobbying for better contract terms.
Against this backdrop, our analytical model illuminates the revenue challenges facing a
government emerging from conflict in a resource-rich country like Liberia or Sierra Leone.
We assume the government has a choice between two revenue rehabilitation strategies. The
first, the impatience strategy, is to contract a multinational mining company to exploit the
resources right away and share the profit with the company. However, the mining cost
is the company’s private information, providing an incentive for the company to cheat by
inflating it. The second strategy, patience, is to defer exploitation of the resource, and rely
on alternative tax instruments while developing resource management capacity. The model
analyzes the challenges associated with the impatience strategy which the government
is likely to pursue given the urgent need to generate revenues to consolidate the peace
process. The findings call attention to the potential role of the international community
in developing post-conflict countries’ natural resource and revenue institutional capacity,
as well as transparent corporate and government institutions for resource management.
While both countries initially adopted an impatience revenue strategy, Liberia appears
to have made more progress towards developing tax and resource management capacity.
2

According to the World Bank 2011 Doing Business Index, the process of paying taxes is
more eﬃcient in Liberia. Time spent to pay taxes per year is 158 hours in Liberia and 357
hours in Sierra Leone. Liberia has made eﬀorts to develop a fiscal framework for natural
resources with the help of the international financial institutions. Both countries have taken
measures to introduce transparency in the management of natural resources and reduce the
risk of the resources fuelling conflict. They have enacted legislation setting aside a share of
the revenues for local communities, and have joined the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI). Liberia has gone much further, becoming Africa’s first EITI compliant
country in 2009. Sierra Leone is yet to reach that stage. Liberia also appears to have
made more eﬀorts to fight corruption in public management. Between 2005 and 2010, it
moved from a rank of 137 out of 158 countries, to 87 out of 178 countries, on Transparency
International’s Corruption Perception Index while Sierra Leone’s rank deteriorated from
125 to 134. Unsurprisingly, Liberia’s revenue-to-GDP ratio has been higher: 30 percent
in 2010 compared to Sierra Leone’s 13 percent. That national income statistics have not
been compiled in Liberia for many years suggests caution in the interpretation of this ratio,
however.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a context for the study
with an overview of political and economic developments in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Section 3 analyses the two countries’ post-conflict strategy to raise revenues from their natural
resources. Section 4 discusses international initiatives to support revenue rehabilitation in
post-conflict resource-rich countries. Section 5 presents the model. Section 6 concludes.

2. The Post-conflict Context in Liberia and Sierra Leone
In this section we present a brief outline of the socioeconomic and political context characterizing post-conflict Liberia and Sierra Leone. The two countries share a border and many
features. The civil wars in the two countries have been blamed on similar factors: State

3

failure in the 1980s, induced by a sharp decline in economic and political governance (Reno
1998). In Liberia, a military coup by Sergeant Samuel Doe in 1980 ended the 130 year
aristocracy of the Americo-Liberian ethnic group — descendants of resettled freed slaves
from the United States — but only magnified the underlying problems of corruption, nepotism and repression (Liberia Poverty Reduction Paper 2005). Charles Taylor launched the
rebellion on Christmas eve, 1989, with the declared goal of remedying the country’s myriad
problems. That year, Liberia’s per capita income was US$400, less than half of its level in
the early 1970s while its external debt stock was 319 percent of GNI, compared with about
30 percent in the mid-1970s (Table 2.1).

Insert Table 2.1 here
Splinter groups emerged in the rebellion. ECOMOG, a force assembled by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), intervened in 1990, using bases in
Sierra Leone. The intervention prevented Taylor from taking complete power but left him
in control of much of the country outside of the capital, Monrovia. In 1997, ECOMOG conducted presidential elections which Taylor won. However, Taylor failed to transition from
warlord to statesman. He sought to eliminate political opponents, godfathered an armsfor-diamonds trade with the Sierra Leone rebels, and kept most of the trade in Liberia’s
natural resources oﬀ-budget (Economist Intelligence Unit 2007). The country soon returned to war. In 2003, with rebels closing in on Monrovia, Taylor agreed to relinquish
power to an interim government and to go into exile. In 2005, elections were conducted
which were won by Mrs. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.
Turning to Sierra Leone, the roots of the 1991-2001civil war have been linked to the
political leadership of the preceding years that emphasized informalization and control of
markets and their reward, and replacement of political competition with a struggle for
political favour (Reno 1998). There was extensive intervention in key markets for rice (the

4

staple food), foreign exchange, diamonds and agricultural exports while political and civil
opposition was curtailed, culminating in a one-party state in 1978. By the mid-1980s,
burgeoning black markets, dysfunctional infrastructure and high unemployment were the
norm. About 80 percent of the population was estimated to live below the poverty line of
US$1 a day. The inflation rate sometimes exceeded 100 percent while government revenues
were about 8 percent of GDP, down from 17 percent in the 1970s (Davies 2007). Real GDP
growth was negative (Table 2.2). The rebellion was launched in 1991 with help from Charles
Taylor’s rebel movement in Liberia. Like in Liberia, the declared aim was to redress the
economic and political malaise aﬄicting the country. The rebels pursued their campaign
despite a military coup in 1992. The military transferred power to an elected government
in 1996 which was overthrown by the military in alliance with the rebel movement in 1997.
The West African force, ECOMOG, intervened to reinstate the elected government in 1997.
The war finally ended in 2002.

Insert Table 2.2 here
The war in Liberia claimed 270000 lives (Liberia Poverty Reduction Strategy 2005)
from a pre-war population of about three million, compared with 50000 deaths in Sierra
Leone, from a pre-war population of about 4.5 million. In Liberia, much of the fighting
took place in Monrovia, damaging much of the infrastructure, unlike in Sierra Leone where
much of the fighting was outside of Freetown. At the end of the war, Monrovia had no
running water or public electric supply, unlike Freetown.
The UN has staged two of its largest peacekeeping operations in the two countries
to help end the civil war. It deployed 17000 peacekeepers in Sierra Leone and a similar
number in Liberia. The two countries have emerged from civil war as budding democracies.
Sierra Leone has conducted two peaceful post-war elections, with the opposition winning
the second. Liberia has also conducted two peaceful post-war elections. It elected Mrs.

5

Helen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first female president, in the first elections in 2005, and
re-elected her in the second in November 2011.
Liberia and Sierra Leone are both resource-rich coastal economies. Diamonds have
played a prominent role in Sierra Leone for good or ill. They accounted for 90 percent
of exports and some 15 percent of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s and about a quarter of
revenues. Iron ore, timber and rubber (mainly from large-scale plantation agriculture)
have historically been Liberia’s leading exports. Sierra Leone has discovered oil (though
the commercial viability is yet to be confirmed) while iron ore is set to become its leading
export from 2012. Liberia is also actively prospecting for oil. Agriculture is the dominant
economic activity, accounting for 60 percent of GDP in Liberia, and 50 percent in Sierra
Leone.
At the end of the civil war, Liberia and Sierra Leone embarked on an IMF-supported
economic reform program. In Liberia, a key conditionality was the operation of a cashbased balanced budget. The Liberian economy is highly dollarized with a US dollar component of over 70 percent of broad money. The two countries have benefitted from forgiveness
of almost all their debt to the multilateral financial institutions after reaching the completion point of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. As a result, the
external debt stock has fallen in Liberia from over a thousand percent of GNI in 2003 to
12 percent in 2010 and in Sierra Leone from 193 percent of GNI in 2000 to 23 percent in
2009.

3. Revenue Measures and Outcomes
In this section we focus on the strategies adopted by Liberia and Sierra Leone to generate
revenues from their natural resources. To provide a context for the analysis we start with
a review of the institutional framework for revenue administration.

6

3.1. Revenue Administration, Policy and Outcomes
Liberia and Sierra Leone implemented a number of measures to rehabilitate and reform
their collapsed revenue infrastructure. In 2003, Sierra Leone set up the semi-autonomous
National Revenue Authority to supervise “all aspects of revenue collection”. Hitherto,
customs duties and income taxes were collected independently while other revenues like
licence fees for mobile telephone operators and fishing vessels were collected by the line
ministries. Other African countries such as Ghana and Uganda have set up a similar
revenue authority, seeking to improve coordination of revenue collection activities, reduce
duplication, and insulate revenue administration from undue external influence.
However, unlike the pattern observed in other countries, following the setting up of the
National Revenue Authority, Sierra Leone’s revenue to GDP ratio fell from 12.3 percent in
2003 to 11.9 percent in 2005 and to 11.7 percent in 2009. A 2007 report on the Authority highlighted the following problems: too many departments and vehicles, weak internal
control over revenue collection, and political nepotism (Presidential transition team report,
2008). The Sierra Leone experience suggests that the fundamental governance problems
facing revenue institutions should be addressed prior to the setting up of an independent
revenue authority. In Liberia, customs duties and income taxes are collected by two departments in the Ministry of Finance. Plans are underway to set up an independent revenue
authority.
Both countries have moved towards automating customs revenue collection by introducing the Automated System for Data Analysis (ASYCUDA) developed by UNCTAD.
Automation could eliminate a major source of private revenues for corrupt customs oﬃcials;
and reduce the scope for duty evasion. Unsurprisingly, it has met with major obstacles in
both countries. Nevertheless, Liberia was able to operationalize within 18 months the more
sophisticated, internet-based ASYCUDA World in the Freeport of Monrovia which handles
85% of the country’s trade. In Sierra Leone, eﬀorts are still ongoing to operationalize the

7

less sophisticated ASYCUDA++.5
In the area of tax reform, Sierra Leone introduced a value-added tax in 2010 to replace
the domestic and import sales tax. The aim has been to replace ineﬃcient production and
sales tax with a less distortionary tax, to increase revenue and improve tax eﬃciency. Plans
are underway to implement the VAT in Liberia by 2013. Table 3.1 examines indicators of
the ease of paying taxes from the World Bank Doing Business Index. The table suggests
that prior to 2012 — the indicators for any year are based on statistics as of June the
previous year — paying taxes was easier and more eﬃciently organized in Liberia than in
Sierra Leone. For instance Liberia ranked 85 and 84 out of 183 countries in the 2010 and
2011 ease of paying taxes index, compared with Sierra Leone’s 160 and 159. In 2012,
Sierra Leone’s ranking improved considerably to 76 out of 183 countries, while Liberia’s
deteriorated to 98. Liberia’s tax administration has been much more eﬃcient in terms
of minimizing the time spent to pay taxes: an average of 158 hours a year from 2008 to
2012, compared with 357 to 399 hours in Sierra Leone. However, the number of payments
required per year in Sierra Leone has been slightly fewer, 29, compared with 32 in Liberia.
Total taxes payable by businesses — the sum of all taxes and mandatory payments like
employer contribution to employee social security — appears to have been inordinate in
Sierra Leone prior to 2012: about 236 percent compared to about 44 percent in Liberia.
Such a high rate of taxation would have been a recipe for tax evasion. As of writing, details
were not available about the reforms undertaken in Sierra Leone that has resulted in the
improvement in its 2012 ranking on the overall ease of paying taxes and the reduction in
total taxes payable.

Liberia has faced some logistical challenges in the implementation of ASYCUDA: The Free Port of
Monrovia has no electric power supply. A 20 KVA generator was bought which is operated for 10 hours
every day. The ASYCUDA system is operated during those ten hours. Limited band width for internet
access is another constraint.

Tables 3.2 and 3.3 below provide statistics on government revenues in Sierra Leone and
Liberia. The tables indicate that revenues from natural resources have been modest in
Sierra Leone with mining revenues (including from diamonds) accounting for less than 4
per cent of total revenues (less than 0.4 per cent of GDP) post-war. This figure excludes
payroll taxes and personal income taxes of employees in mining companies. When these are
included, mining revenues were about US$28 million in 2010 (12 per cent of total revenues
and 1.5 per cent of GDP). The country has been unable to generate large revenues from
the exploitation of alluvial diamonds despite exports of over a hundred million dollars
in recent years (Appendix Table 3.1) due to the diﬃculty of policing the resource. The
deposits are widely dispersed and can be mined with simple hand-held tools, facilitating
illicit mining, and smuggling to evade taxes. Thus, export taxes have been kept low —
3 percent initially and then 6 percent in 2010 — to reduce the incentive for smuggling.
Production of diamonds from Kimberlite deposits began in 2003 by the Koidu Holdings
company. Kimberlite deposits are spatially concentrated and require capital intensive
mining techniques, precluding illicit mining and hence oﬀering better revenue prospects.
In Liberia, revenues from natural resources have apparently also been modest in the
post-war period. An exception is one-oﬀ initial payments totalling US$80 million made
between 2009 and 2011 by four iron ore mining firms upon signing of mining concessions.
It is not clear under which category these payments have been recorded in Table 3.3. Iron
ore production was scheduled to start by the end of 2011. While rubber has been the main
export, accounting for 40-95 percent of total exports (Appendix Table 3.2), details of its
fiscal contribution are lacking. The export of timber, a major pre-war source of revenue,
was banned by the UN till 2007. Subsequently, stumpage fees (a percentage of the FOB
price of timber) and land rental fees accounted for 5 per cent of total revenues in 2010.
Sierra Leone and Liberia have relied heavily on international trade taxes over the years.
These have accounted for 50-60 per cent of total revenues in Sierra Leone, and 30-40 per
cent in Liberia. Petroleum imports have been taxed heavily generating import duties
9

of over ten percent of total revenues in Sierra Leone. In Liberia, maritime revenues —
registration fees from foreign ships flying the Liberian flag — have been a major source of
revenues especially before the end of the conflict in 2005, accounting for 18-29 per cent of
total revenues.

3.2. Natural Resource Revenue Strategies
With the onset of peace the governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone quickly embarked
on the exploitation of natural resources. However, the institutional capacity to negotiate
and implement contracts was weak while a defined fiscal regime for natural resources was
lacking. Moreover, there were existing contracts that wartime governments had hastily
signed. Unsurprisingly the fiscal terms initially agreed were perceived to give less than
full value to the two countries for their natural resources. The rush to exploit natural
resources was to be expected in Liberia in particular. It had a large unelected transitional
government from 2003 when the war ended to 2006 comprising members of various warring
factions. In Sierra Leone, the government in power in 2002 at the end of the conflict was
elected in 1996, and re-elected in 2002.
In Liberia, Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf’s elected government, upon taking oﬃce in January
2006, decided to renegotiate all natural resource agreements entered into by the transitional
government. The new government also subjected the 300-plus members of the transitional
government to a special audit, many of whom, including the leader, were subsequently
convicted of corruption (Economist Intelligence Unit 2007). The new government went on
to sign iron ore mining agreements with Arcelor Mittal, the leading global steel producer, in
2006, and later with three other mining companies. Following widespread concerns about

10

generous fiscal concessions, the government renegotiated the contract with Arcelor Mittal.
In Sierra Leone, Koidu Holdings began to mine kimberlite diamonds in 2003, having
purchased the mining rights from Branch Energy, based on an agreement signed during the
war. The government signed an agreement for the mining of rutile with Sierra Rutile in
2001, and bauxite with Sierra Minerals Holdings Limited in 2004. The government of President Koroma, elected from the opposition in 2007, signed iron ore mining contracts with
London Mining in 2009, and with African Minerals in 2010. Like in Liberia, widespread
concerns about generous fiscal concessions led to renegotiation of contracts. Petroleum
exploration agreements, signed from 2001, were the only exception. The prospects of petroleum discovery were seemingly poor at the time.
Despite the sometimes repeated revisions, concerns endure that current exploitation
contracts still oﬀer overly generous fiscal concessions as well as considerable scope for fiscal
abuse. Notably, in Sierra Leone, the government bridged a loan from the European Union
to provide start-up capital for Sierra Rutile, bearing much of the production risk, and
set the royalty rate at a meagre half a percent. The government argued that generous
fiscal concessions were necessary to attract foreign investors at a time when the country
was perceived as a high risk environment. African Minerals, an iron ore mining company
in Sierra Leone, enjoys “duty and excise-free import of all equipment and consumables
for company and contractors throughout mine life”. The norm in the industry in other
countries is to limit duty-free imports to the start of production. Moreover, the diﬃculty
of distinguishing contractor’s imports intended for use by African Minerals from those
intended for other purposes represents a potential source of revenue loss for the government.
Another concern is that fiscal terms vary within a sector, creating an uneven playing
field. This could discourage investment by signalling unpredictability and lack of policy
consistency; and could also produce an incentive for investors to lobby for better contract
terms. Tables 3.4 and 3.5 below which summarize key fiscal terms in iron ore contracts
in Liberia and Sierra Leone, show that in Liberia in particular, there are diﬀerences in
11

the tax rates, royalties, and exemptions on import duties. This has been the result of
case-by-case negotiations to resolve overlaps and ambiguities caused by the existence of a
number of laws governing the fiscal terms of natural resource contracts — the New Minerals
and Mining Law, the Liberian Revenue Code, and the Investment Incentive Code of 1973.
Some terms of individual contracts are inconsistent with existing legislation. For instance
the income tax rate agreed with BHP Billiton and China Union in Liberia is 25 per cent
compared with 30 per cent in the Liberian Revenue Code.

Insert Table 3.4 here

Insert Table 3.5 here
In Liberia, the government revealed a strong preference for initial payments. The
preference for initial payment, the main biddable item in iron ore contracts, led to major
fiscal concessions and to renegotiation of the Bong mines iron ore contract already awarded
by competitive bidding. The fiscal terms (other than initial payment) for the contract
were initially fixed and declared not open to bidding or negotiations. China Union won
the bid with a signature bonus of US$40 million. However, before the contract was signed,
following the onset of the global financial crisis, China Union argued that, in the face of
falling commodity prices, the signature bonus could only be maintained if major fiscal
concessions were awarded. The government agreed to this, rather than turn to the secondranked bidder in the auction which had oﬀered a much smaller signature bonus.
Appendix Table 3.3 summarizes natural resource contract award mechanisms in Liberia
and Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone, there has been no clear institutional framework for
awarding contracts unlike in Liberia which has a centralized framework coordinated by
an investment commission and involving line ministries. Liberia has moved towards competitive bidding for the award of contracts in forestry, iron ore mining, and petroleum
exploration. However, as noted above, the competitive bidding process has sometimes
12

been accompanied by direct negotiation with the successful bidder, resulting in a revision
of bid terms.
There have been considerable delays in payments and the start of production in Liberia.
In the iron ore sector, China Union delayed for over a year in payment of signature bonus
while production by Arcelor Mittal was delayed by the global recession which created cash
flow problems for the company. Only one of the seven Forest Management Contractors
(awarded between October 2008 and September 2009) and three of the nine Timber Sales
Contractors (awarded between June 2008 and July 2010) had started exporting by early
2011. Two Forest Management Contractors had still not paid tax arrears for the previous
tax year while none had paid area fees and the land rental.

4. Revenue-Rehabilitation Initiatives by the International Community
In recent years the international community has perceived revenue rehabilitation in postconflict environments as a key element of its approach to building a legitimate and eﬀective
state as the basis for durable peace. This section highlights key initiatives that have been
undertaken to rehabilitate revenues in resource-rich countries emerging from conflict and
to address other related challenges.
4.1. Preventing the use of natural resources to fuel conflict
The UN imposed sanctions on diamond exports from Sierra Leone, Angola and Liberia
during the civil war in these countries in an eﬀort to stop the use of diamonds to finance
conflict. It then adopted in 2000 an international certification scheme for rough diamonds.
The scheme was succeeded by the Kimberley Diamond Certification Process launched in
2003 as “a joint government, industry and civil society initiative to stem the flow of conflict
diamonds to finance wars against legitimate governments”. The scheme requires member

13

governments to certify shipments of rough diamonds as ‘conflict-free’. As of January 2012,
the Kimberley Process had 50 participants, representing 76 countries — including Liberia
and Sierra Leone and other post-conflict countries — with the European Union and its
member states counting as a single participant. Member countries account for nearly 100
percent of the global production of rough diamonds. The international diamond industry
and civil society organizations also participate in process. However, the benefits of the
scheme for countries that are no longer in conflict are likely to be limited, given that the
initiative was designed primarily for countries in conflict.
4.2. Increasing transparency and accountability in the management of natural
resources
The Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) aims to strengthen governance by
improving transparency and accountability in the extractives sector in resource-rich countries in general (including non-conflict countries). The EITI supports improved governance
in resource-rich countries through the verification and full publication of company payments
and government revenues from oil, gas and mining. The EITI is a coalition of governments,
companies, civil society groups, investors and international organizations. It is a global
standard that promotes revenue transparency and provides a procedure for monitoring
and reconciling company payments and government revenues at the country level. Each
implementing country creates its own EITI process which is overseen by participants from
the government, companies and national civil society. In October 2009, Liberia became
the first country in Africa, and the second in the world, to attain EITI compliant status
— a stage in which a country is considered to have met all EITI requirements. Fourteen
countries are now EITI Compliant while twenty one, including Sierra Leone, are at the
initial “candidate status” stage. Other countries have signaled their intent to implement
the EITI.
Another initiative has been “Publish What You Pay” — a global network of civil society
14

organizations which campaigns for transparency in the extractive industries. The initiative
calls for companies to “publish what you pay” and for governments to “publish what
you earn”. It was motivated by a report published by the advocacy organization Global
Witness on the role of the oil and banking industries in the misappropriation of state assets
in Angola during the civil war. Publish What You Pay membership currently spans 60
countries including Liberia and Sierra Leone.
4.3. Strengthening revenue collection and administration
The World Bank, IMF, African Development Bank and bilateral donors have provided technical and financial assistance to help countries emerging from conflict rebuild their revenue
collection and administration capacity. Notably, donors have funded the setting up of
a semi-autonomous independent revenue authority in Uganda and Sierra Leone; and the
automation of customs revenue collection in Liberia and Sierra Leone which involved the
setting up of the ASYCUDA software system. Donors have sometimes used conditionality
to address concerns that aid might substitute, rather than develop, domestic revenue capacity. The European Union conditioned its 2002 budget support to Mozambique — which
experienced civil conflict from 1977 to 1992 — on increases in domestic revenue (Boyce and
O’Donnell 2007). One of the benchmarks in the Afghanistan Compact of 2006, which sets
out the framework for international assistance, was an increase in the revenue/GDP ratio
from 4.5 percent in 2004-05 to 8 percent in 2010-11 (Boyce and O’Donnell 2007).
4.4. Preventing illegal exploitation of natural resources
Liberia has adopted a Chain of Custody certification scheme for timber and timber products
which partly financed the civil war. The Chain of Custody scheme, a requirement by the
UN for lifting sanctions on timber exports, is a traceability system that confirms that
taxes have been paid and certifies that the timber product comes from an ethically well
managed source. The Switzerland-based Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS) was hired
15

in October 2007 to build, implement and eventually transfer the Chain of Custody system
to Liberia’s Forestry Development Authority (FDA).
Also, the government of Liberia has signed Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPA)
with the European Union to ensure that all timber products exported to the European
Union are of legal origin. The VPA is a bilateral agreement between the European Union
and wood exporting countries which aims to improve forest governance and ensure that
the wood imported into the European Union has complied with the legal requirements
of the partner country. There is no obligation for any country to enter into a VPA with
the European Union. However, once agreed, VPAs are legally binding on both parties,
committing them to trading only in wood products that can be verified as legal.
4.5. Managing the wealth from the natural resources
In 2011 the IMF launched the multi-donor Topical Trust Fund on Managing Natural Resource Wealth to finance technical assistance to low-income and lower-middle-income countries endowed with oil, gas, and minerals to help them deal with the associated economic
policy challenges. The trust fund seeks to help build macroeconomic policy capacities and
assist countries to get a fair share of their natural resource wealth, and invest and spend
it wisely. The Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland have made contributions to the trust
fund which concentrate on capacity building in five areas:
• extractive industries fiscal regime;
• extractive industries revenue administration;
• fiscal policies and public financial management specific to resource-rich countries;
• natural-resources-related financial asset and liability management; and
• statistics for natural resources.
The trust fund will serve 15-20 countries from a group of 50 eligible countries that have
substantial current or prospective extractive industry revenue. Country commitment to
reform will be a key selection criterion.
16

4.6. Enhancing the benefits of natural resources to host communities
Such initiatives have been prompted by widespread concerns that host communities benefit
little from the exploitation of natural resources. One such initiative is the Peace Diamond
Alliance in Sierra Leone sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In 2002, USAID brought together producers, buyers, advocates, Sierra
Leone government oﬃcials and heavyweight industry players such as DeBeers and Rappaport to form an alliance for the first time to monitor diamond royalties and fees, inform
miners of the value of stones, start addressing environmental degradation, and reduce exploitation of miners, especially children. Training was provided to help miners assess the
true value of rough diamonds before making a sale. USAID also began a pilot program
to give miners access to credit at reasonable terms to purchase mining inputs and avoid
getting into serious debt. These strategies were designed to help miners sell their stones to
the highest bidder.
Generally, donors and domestic and international advocacy groups have advocated for
measures to distribute some of the revenues from natural resources to the host communities.
As a result, in Liberia the law stipulates the allocation of revenues from timber as follows:
10 percent of log export fees and of stumpage fees to the Protected Forest Areas Network;
30 percent of land rental fees to forest communities; 30 percent to counties; and 40 percent
to general revenues. In Sierra Leone the Mines and Minerals Act imposes a one percent
expenditure tax on mining companies for community development. Also half of the 20
percent profit sharing tax on Koidu Holdings, a company mining diamonds from Kimberlite
sources, is paid directly to the mining community. With regard to alluvial diamonds, the
government initially levied a three percent tax on exports —subsequently increased to six
percent — and distributed half a percentage point to the diamond mining communities.
(The half a percentage point was the rate when the export tax was three percent. We lack
information about whether this rate may have increased at the higher export tax rate of

17

six percent.)

5. A Model of Post-Conflict Revenue Rehabilitation
In this section, we provide a framework for analyzing the revenue rehabilitation challenges
confronting post-war Liberia and Sierra Leone. Consider a benevolent government aiming
to raise revenue to finance the peace consolidation process in the aftermath of a civil
war. The country is endowed with a stock, , of a given natural resource, say iron ore,
which requires a large capital outlay to exploit. The government has a choice between two
revenue strategies. The first is to contract a multinational mining company to mine the
resource right away – the impatience strategy. The other strategy is to delay exploiting
the resource, and in the meantime, rely on alternative non-resource tax instruments while
developing the public management institutions that will ensure the government gets good
value for the resource – the patience strategy.
But in the aftermath of a devastating conflict, as in the case of Liberia and Sierra
Leone, weak administrative capacity and a low non-resource tax base may limit the scope
for raising non-resource tax revenues. Therefore, the government may have no choice but
to adopt the impatience strategy. In what follows, we highlight the challenges confronting
an impatient government in a post-conflict environment.
5.1. The Payoﬀ to Impatience
Suppose the government considers a contract requiring that the mining company pays a
fraction  ∈ [0 1] of the gross receipts, less the mining cost. Denote gross receipts by ,
and let the reported mining cost, , be restricted to the closed interval [0  ]. This implies
that the reported mining cost cannot be less than the true cost, 0 , and cannot exceed
total receipts,   +∞. Under this contract, the government will receive a share  ( − )
of the profit, with the remaining share accruing to the company, (1 − ) ( − ).
18

An important feature of the model is that the mining cost, , is the company’s private
information, providing an incentive for the company to cheat by inflating it. Aware of this,
the government may need to invest a level of public funds, , to uncover the scheme used
by the multinational firm to misrepresent the level of the mining cost. Transfer pricing is
one possible misrepresentation scheme that the company could use.
The sequence of events under this revenue rehabilitation strategy is as follows. First,
the government signs a contract with the mining company to mine the resource. Next
the mining company decides whether or not to cheat by inflating the mining cost, . If it
decides to cheat, it declares a mining cost , which in turn gives rise to a net government
revenue,
 =  ( − ) − 

(5.1)

̄ =  ( − 0 ) − 

(5.2)

if cheating is not detected and

if it is. In the latter case, the multinational firm is assumed to repay all the money owed
the government. After that, nature moves to reveal whether or not misrepresentation of
the mining costs is detected. We denote as  the probability that misrepresentation of the
mining cost is uncovered. Next, nature moves again to reveal whether or not the peace
process is consolidated. Finally, the economy ends.
Let
 =  − 0

(5.3)

denote the extent of mining cost misrepresentation by the multinational firm, i.e., the
fictitious amount by which the true mining cost, 0 , is inflated. We make the following
assumption.

19

A.1. The probability, , that cheating is detected is given by:

 =  ( ) 

(5.4)

with (i)   0, (ii)   0, and (iii)   0, where  ∈ (0 1) denotes a scalar
measuring the productivity of the detection technology available to the government.
Furthermore,
  1

(5.5)

where
 = 


 ( )

denotes the elasticity of the probability that cheating is detected with respect to the
size of the payoﬀ from cheating.
Assumption 1 implies that poor institutional capacity is an issue not only when the
post-conflict government chooses to adopt a "patience strategy", but also when it elects to
follows the "impatience strategy", because of the need to mitigate perverse incentives to the
multinational firm. Indeed, a low  implies a poor institutional environment that impedes
government capacity to fight corruption in mining. This may also happen if accountability
mechanisms are weak. Condition (5.5) on the other hand states that the probability that
cheating is detected is not too sensitive to the size of the payoﬀ from cheating. This can
happen when a large proportion of overseas transactions aﬀecting the cost of mining occurs
between the multinational and its parent company, thereby maximizing the secrecy of the
mining operations.
Another important feature of the model is that government revenue is an input in the
peace process (for instance, it could be used to enhance job-creation for former combatants).
We thus add the following assumption:
A.2. The probability that the country returns to war, , is a decreasing function of the
20

level of government revenue, , invested in the peace process:

 = 1 − 

(5.6)

where  ∈ (0 1) is a scalar.
Assumption 2 highlights the political salience of revenue rehabilitation in the aftermath of civil war and other devastating conflicts. It implies that government ability to
rehabilitate state revenue is crucial to lasting peace, which is necessary for sustaining rebuilding eﬀorts. Indeed, the lower the state revenue, , the higher the probability that the
peace process will collapse, leading to a recurrence of the conflict.
We define the expected payoﬀ from following the impatience strategy in the process of
revenue rehabilitation to be the expected value of the probability that the peace process
is consolidated, 1 − :  =  (1 − ). The objective of the post-conflict government is to
maximize the expected value of this probability. This expected value can be written as
follows using the definition of  :
£
¤
 =  ̄ + (1 − )  

(5.7)

From (5.7), substituting in (5.1), (5.2), (5.3), and (5.4), re-arranging, yields a reformulation of this expected payoﬀ as follows:

̄ (   ) = ( ( − 0 ) −  −  [1 −  ( )]) 

(5.8)

To fully highlight the challenges facing a post-conflict government that adopts the impatience strategy, we need to specify the government choice of the level of public funds
invested in mitigating corruption.

21

5.1.1. Government Response to Cheating
Taking the level of cheating  =  − 0 as a proxy for the incidence of corruption in this
post-conflict country, the implications of the impatience strategy for government revenue
may arguably depend on (i) the productivity of the cheating detection technology, , (ii)
the level of corruption, , and (iii) the share of mining revenues accruing to the government,
.
Therefore, a benevolent government’s problem is to choose  so as to solve:

max ̄ (   )


Since by assumption 1 the function  is strictly concave in , the optimal choice, ∗ ,
must therefore satisfy the following necessary and suﬃcient condition:

 ( )  − 1 = 0

(5.9)

Applying the Implicit Function Theorem to (5.9) yields the government optimal choice of
anti-corruption action as follows:

∗ = Θ (  )

(5.10)

where

()

Θ  0

()

Θ  0

()

Θ  0

as an implication of Assumption 1. In other words, government eﬀort to thwart corruption in mining extraction is higher (i) the more productive the detection technology,
22

(ii) the higher its claim to the mining revenues, and (iii) the higher the firm’s payoﬀ from
cheating.
5.2. The Determinants of the Eﬀectiveness of the Impatience Strategy
We now discuss factors that bear on the eﬀectiveness of a post-conflict revenue rehabilitation strategy based on impatience.
With the above result, we can now reformulate the optimal government payoﬀ from
following the impatience strategy as follows using (5.8):

̄ ∗ (  ) = ( ( − 0 ) − Θ (  ) −  [1 −  [Θ (  )  ]]) 
Hence the following proposition which is obtained by a straightforward application of the
Envelope Theorem:
Proposition 1. Let Assumption 1 and 2 hold. Then, in a post-conflict environment,
(i) access to a more productive cheating detection technology raises the expected payoﬀ
from adopting an impatience revenue rehabilitation strategy (i.e.,  ̄ ∗   0), (ii) as does
government’s ability to secure a favorable mining deal (i.e.,  ̄ ∗   0). Furthermore, (iii)
this expected payoﬀ decreases with the size of the payoﬀ from cheating (i.e.,  ̄ ∗   0).
Proposition 1 highlights the challenges facing a post-conflict government pursuing the
impatience strategy for rehabilitating state revenue. First, detection of cheating is diﬃcult
because of weak institutional capacity for monitoring mining activity. Second, the government is often in a weak bargaining position relative to mining companies: It often lacks
the technical capacity and international experience to secure a good deal for its natural
resources . In these circumstances, as demonstrated in Section 4, the international community could play a critical role to help ensure the country gets a fair share of the natural
resource benefits. First, it could use aid to raise — the productivity of the cheating detection technology. The international community could also use aid, especially technical
23

assistance, to strengthen the government’s negotiating capacity , raising , the government share of mining revenues. Third, the international community could pressure both
the government and exploiting companies to be transparent in their actions.
5.3. Synthesis
We have developed a model to highlight the revenue rehabilitation challenges facing Liberia
and Sierra Leone at the onset of peace. A key conclusion of the analysis is that prioritizing the development of public management institutions prior to the exploitation of the
natural resources is required for a country to get full value for its natural resources. This
conclusion concurs with Stiglitz (2007) who discusses the problems facing developing country governments in dealing with multinational oil exploitation companies. However, our
analysis qualifies this conclusion: in the absence of alternative fiscal instruments, even a
benevolent government might be forced to exploit the resources prior to developing sound
public management institutions.
Although Liberia and Sierra Leone seemingly rushed to exploit their natural resources
at the onset of peace, by several measures, Liberia appears to have pursued a more patient
revenue rehabilitation strategy over time. It has developed a fiscal framework for the
natural resource sector, with the help of the international financial institutions, and has
also realized much more improvement in fighting corruption. Between 2005 and 2010, it
moved from a rank of 137 out of 158 countries, to 87 out of 178 countries, on Transparency
International’s Corruption Perception Index while Sierra Leone’s rank deteriorated from
125 to 134. Liberia’s revenue-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent in 2010 is much higher than
Sierra Leone’s 13 percent. However, we hesitate to advance this as evidence that Liberia’s
patience has paid oﬀ because national income statistics have not been compiled in Liberia
until recently, raising doubts about the reliability of GDP estimates.
The model is based on a number of simplifying assumptions which can be relaxed,
such as a benevolent government. With a not-so-benevolent government or a government
24

with a short-time horizon , the tendency towards impatience would only be stronger. For
simplicity, the government rehabilitation strategy was presented as a stark choice between
patience and impatience. In reality, the choice of strategy would lie in between and could
change over time. Lastly, we assumed that under the patience strategy, with time, strong
public management institutions can be developed. However, we ignored the question of
how long that may take, if ever.

6. Conclusion
At the end of their respective civil conflicts, Liberia and Sierra Leone initially adopted an
impatience strategy to generate revenues from their natural resources, opting to initiate
right away the process of exploiting the resources despite weak public management capacity.
Unsurprisingly, the generous fiscal concessions often granted exploiting companies raised
concerns about whether the two countries were getting good value for their resources. Such
concerns endure despite the corrective measures that both countries have taken with the
revision of mining contracts and eﬀorts to develop public management capacity.
A key lesson from the two countries’ experience and our analytical model is that
resource-rich countries emerging from conflict face a diﬃcult trade-oﬀ between relatively
large longer-term gains from their natural resources and smaller short-term revenues. With
a narrow non-resource fiscal base, the need to consolidate the peace process may make
adoption of the impatience strategy inevitable. Moreover, other factors, notably elections
which generate huge spending pressures, may also induce impatience.The international
community can mitigate the potential costs of impatience in revenue generation by providing assistance to enhance the capacity of countries emerging from conflict to manage
their natural resources especially with regard to the negotiation and implementation of
contracts with exploiting companies. Home countries of exploiting companies can help by
setting and enforcing ethical standards for exploiting companies in their activities abroad.

25

Similarly, as demonstrated by ongoing initiatives, the international civil society can advocate for such standards and monitor the activities of both the government and resource
exploiting companies.
