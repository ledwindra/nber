This paper introduces a friction into a standard model that helps resolve these anomalies.  The friction is that international loans are imperfectly enforceable; any country can renege on its debts and suffer the consequences for future borrowing.  To solve for equilibrium in this economy with endogenous incomplete markets, the methods of Marcet and Marimon (1999) are extended.  Incorporating the friction helps resolve the anomalies more than does exogenously restricting  the assets that can be traded.\n\n",
