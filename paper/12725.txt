ABSTRACT
This paper provides a new heterogeneous firm model for trade where firms differ in their productivity
and experience different market demand shocks. The model incorporates variations in trade policy,
trade preferences, and the rules of origin needed to obtain them, to reflect real world differences faced
by Bangladeshi garment exporters in the US and EU. We estimate firms' productivity using an extension
of the Olley Pakes procedure that accounts for the biases arising from both demand shocks and productivity
being unobserved. Predictions of the model are then tested non-parametrically and are shown to be
supported empirically.

Introduction

This paper models the responses of heterogeneous …rms to di¤erences in trade policies faced by
them in di¤erent product and export destinations. It presents direct evidence supportive of the
model’s predictions using a data set of Bangladeshi garments exporters. It focuses on the e¤ect of
di¤erences in trade polices, trade preferences, and the rules of origin1 (ROOs) needed to obtain
them, on the pattern of …rm exports and performance.
To date, most of the literature on trade policy assumes that …rms are homogeneous. When
…rms are homogeneous, they will not make di¤erent choices unless they are indi¤erent between the
alternatives and even then, their choices will be random. If …rms do make systematically di¤erent
choices, then homogenous …rm models, while useful, miss an essential part of the story. As a result,
their predictions and policy prescriptions will be less nuanced2 and may even be misleading. For
example, the correlation between being an exporter and having high TFP used to be interpreted
as evidence that exporting raised productivity and that this was the reason to encourage exports.
However, work in the late 90’s suggested that …rm heterogeneity plays a key role: exporters tend to
be the more productive …rms, so that this policy advice might well be misleading.3 In this vein, our
work suggests that trade preferences granted to developing countries and the associated costs due
to ROOs may distort their pattern of investment, reduce the average productivity of exporters,
and bias export away from the direction of natural comparative advantage. Consequently, even
liberal preferences may be far less e¤ective in promoting development than expected.
The empirical application is the apparel sector with two major sub-sectors: garments made from
woven cloth, and those made from non-woven material, namely, sweaters and knitwear. Although
the EU is the favored export destination for Bangladeshi …rms as a whole, it is less so for …rms
making woven garments. While the EU bias can easily be explained in a standard homogeneous
…rm setting by the less harsh trade policy of the EU overall, homogenous …rm models cannot
explain another fact that is clear in the data: namely, …rms that export to the US are larger, more
productive, and tend to export to more markets than those who export to the EU. This is especially
so in the non-woven sector. This calls for a heterogeneous …rms setup that models the di¤erences
in trade policy stances in the US and EU, as well as across woven and non-woven sectors.

See Krueger (1999), Krishna and Krueger (1995), Ju and Krishna (2005) on modelling ROOs.
For example, Bernard, Redding and Schott (2006) argue that trade liberalization forces …rms to focus on their
core competencies, which provides an additional source of gains from liberalization.

Why look at Bangladesh? First, there are di¤erences across products (garments made from
woven cloth and non-woven ones) and export destinations (the EU and the US) that make for an
interesting natural experiment as described in the next section. We have a unique …rm level data
set (with information on output and input prices, costs as well as revenues by export destinations)
that lets us take the predictions of our theoretical model regarding the e¤ects of such di¤erences
in trade policies to the data. Second, Bangladesh is among the major garment suppliers to both
the EU and US markets4 . Moreover, as one of the poorer developing countries, insights based on
its experience are likely to resonate with other such countries.
In our data we …nd that there are …rms who export to the tougher market, but not to easier
ones, which contradicts the predictions of the standard heterogeneous …rms model as in Melitz
(2003). This cannot be thought of as just due to randomness in the data, since such …rms tend to
be much larger, and this size di¤erence increases with the di¤erence in the toughness of the two
markets.5 In addition, in our data, we also observe some smaller …rms with disproportionately large
investment. Both these empirical features suggest that a …rm’s investment and exporting decisions
depend not only on productivity, but also on market demand shocks that are …rm speci…c.6 For this
reason we introduce a new dimension of …rm heterogeneity into the Melitz (2003) model which we
term …rm and market speci…c demand shocks. They parsimoniously capture factors, like business
contacts or networks, or even fashion shocks, that make buyers more attracted to one …rm rather
than another in a particular market.7
The presence of …rm speci…c market demand shocks enriches the predictions of the theoretical
model and also has implications for the estimation of …rm productivity. The standard Olley and
Pakes (1996) procedure, which addresses input endogeneity and selection bias, is no longer su¢ cient,
given that there is more than one …rm speci…c time-varying unobservable. We use our model to
guide the estimation of productivity taking into account the presence of …rm speci…c market demand
shocks. Our work, thus, …ts into a new line of research that …ne tunes …rm productivity estimation
in the presence of demand shocks. Recent work in this area includes Katayama, Lu and Tybout
(forthcoming), De Loecker (2007), and Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008). These papers

According to data obtained from Comtrade, in 2003, Bangladesh supplied $3.7 and $1.8 billion worth of apparel
products to the EU and US, and ranked 7th and 8th in the two markets, respectively.
5
We document these patterns in Kee and Krishna (2008) and argue that they can be explained by letting …rms
di¤er not just in their productivity, but also in the market demand shock they face.
6
Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz (2008) also use demand shocks to explain why some French …rms skip nearby
Belgium while exporting to some more distant countries.
7
Exchange rate ‡uctuations or trade policy preferences could also be considered to be a special kind of market
demand shocks that are common to all …rms, but speci…c to a market.

deal with the issues that arise when only revenue data is available. Given that …rm price data are
rarely available, it is a common practice in the …eld to use an industry price index to de‡ate …rms’
revenue used in the production function estimation. This practice contaminates the productivity
estimates with demand shocks. Katayama, Lu and Tybout (forthcoming) argue that a structural
approach that allows for demand and productivity shocks, together with good data on prices, can
help a lot here even when only revenue data is available. De Loecker (2007) uses …rm-product
dummies to control for time-invariant demand shocks in an augmented OP procedure for …rm
productivity estimation. Foster et al (2008) use a …rm’s quantity to estimate physical productivity
and use a …rm’s price index to estimate demand shocks. As do Foster et al (2008), we also have …rm
level price indices in our data set. However, instead of using input cost shares to measure input
elasticities in the production function as in Foster et al (2008), we estimate these input elasticities
according to a procedure suggested in Ackerberg, Benkard, Berry and Pakes (2007).8 Our point
is that even with …rm level price indices it is still essential to incorporate demand shocks into the
estimation of TFP itself as investment is not a su¢ cient proxy for productivity.
Speci…cally, in our case, investment will depend not only on the unobserved productivity, but
also unobserved demand shocks in the multiple export markets …rms operate. Hence, investment
alone will be an inadequate proxy for productivity. We need controls for each of the market demand
shocks as well.9 We argue that we can use the vector of investment and the shares in each market
to control for the vector of productivity and market demand shocks just as investment is used to
control for productivity in the work of Olley and Pakes (1996). In our data set, we have sales
information of each …rm in each of the export markets they operate, which allows us to construct
the share of each market in the …rm’s sales. These export share variables vary by …rm, market,
and year and are suitable to be used as controls for …rm speci…c market demand shocks. If a
…rm faces a positive demand shock in the EU market, it will invest more and export more of its
products to the EU. As a result, we observe an increase in investment and the EU export share,
and a decrease in the US export share. Alternatively, a positive productivity shock will prompt the
…rm to invest and produce more without changing its export composition. So its export share in
each of the markets remains constant while investment increases. Finally, a negative demand shock
8

Kee (2004) shows that input cost shares equal to input elasticities in the production function only if there are
constant returns to scale, which is not clear in our current application.
9
De Loecker (2007) uses …rm-product dummies to control for demand shocks in production function estimation
as demand shocks also a¤ect investment. However, such dummies can only control for demand shocks that do not
change with time, and will not be suitable in our context to explain the year to year variation in investment of each
…rm.

4

in the EU market will cause investment and the EU export share to decrease, together with an
increase in the US export share. Thus, when put together, a time varying polynomial function of
investment and export shares can proxy for unobserved productivity and market demand shocks.
The three-stage approach we use yields very sensible estimates for the production functions and
passes the over-identifying restriction tests for whether investment and export shares are su¢ cient
to control for unobserved productivity and market speci…c demand shocks. Once TFP is estimated,
by assuming a CES demand structure and using the estimated …rm productivity to instrument for
price, we back out each …rm’s demand shocks in the EU and the US.
We then use the estimated …rm productivity and demand shocks to explain the export destinations of the …rms within an industry in a given year. Our …ndings are as predicted by the
model. The probability a …rm only exports to the EU decreases with increases in productivity,
with favorable demand shocks in the US and with adverse demand shocks in the EU. Conversely,
the probability a …rm exports to both the EU and the US increases with increases in productivity
and with favorable demand shocks in the US and the EU. We also …nd evidence suggesting that
those …rms that only export to the US (whose presence is impossible without demand shocks) are
mainly driven by favorable demand shocks in the US together with adverse demand shocks in the
EU, but not by productivity.
The regression results further show that, controlling for …rm-market speci…c demand shocks
and other …rm attributes, …rms that export to both the EU and the US are more productive on
average in both industries. Moreover, when ROOs are binding, those …rms that satisfy ROOs are
signi…cantly more productive. Between industry comparisons also reveal that a greater share of
…rms export to both the EU and the US markets in wovens than in non-wovens, and while those
…rms that only export to the EU are less productive, the spread of productivity is larger in nonwovens. These …ndings provide evidence linking trade preferences and relaxed ROOs to the market
access of less productive …rms which otherwise would not have been participated in the export
market.
Finally, we employ a nonparametric test of stochastic dominance developed in Anderson (1996)
to evaluate the predictions of the model on productivity distributions of di¤erent groups of …rms.
Our predictions are shown to be consistent with the data.
Thus, the contribution of this paper is as follows. First, after incorporating the presence of …rm
and market speci…c demand shocks, our heterogenous …rm model shows how di¤erences in trade
policy of the EU and US and in the preferences granted by them to Bangladesh, in combination with
5

the ROOs needed to access them, act as a sorting mechanism for …rms.10 Second, in terms of data,
our …rm level data allows us to construct …rm level price indices for output and inputs in contrast
to much of the literature that is forced to use industry wide indices, which bias the productivity
estimates. Third, in terms of methodology, the extended OP approach allows for market demand
shocks that vary across …rms, and therefore, relaxes the assumption that investment is an increasing
function of productivity alone. Based on the productivity estimates, we take the model to the data
and show that the empirical evidence supports the model’s predictions. Finally, in the area of
trade policy-for-growth, the results of our paper suggest that the promise of market access coming
from trade preference is realized only for those sectors that have relaxed ROOs: In these sectors,
trade preferences and relaxed ROOs signi…cantly expand the participation of …rms from developing
countries, so that …rms with lower productivity are able to export. In other words, there is an
expansion in the extensive margin due to trade preferences for developing countries resulting in
more exporting …rms and varieties, though these …rms tend to be small and unproductive.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II contains a brief discussion of the trade environment
in which the industry operates. Section III describes the data. Section IV lays out the theoretical
model and outlines its predictions. The estimation of …rm productivity and tests of the model’s
predictions are presented in Section V. Section VI concludes.

II

The Trade Policy Environment

There are three main components of the trade environment, namely, the trade policy of the US and
the EU, the trade preferences granted to Bangladesh, and rules of origin upon which preferences
are conditional. Both the US and EU had trade restrictions in the Apparel industry in 1999-2003.
The US had tari¤s of about 20% applied on a Most Favorite Nations (MFN) basis as well as MFA
quota restrictions in place in selected apparel categories for most developing countries, including
Bangladesh.11 The quotas were country speci…c, exporting was contingent on obtaining origin: that
is, unless the good was shown to originate from Bangladesh, it could not enter under its quota.12
10
Although there are a number of papers now dealing with heterogeneous …rm models in general equilibrium (see,
for example, Melitz (2003), Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003), Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007)), this
paper is the …rst to our knowledge that focuses of the results of di¤erential trade policies.
11
Of the 924 HS 10 digit garment products Bangladesh exported to the US each year (1998-2004), half were
subjected to quota restrictions. In terms of value, 74% of garment imports from Bangladesh were from the woven
industry (HS62), and the remaining 26% came from the knitwear industry (HS61), which also included sweaters.
Roughly 75% of Bangladeshi exports were under quota.
12
Note that less competitive countries are at less of an disadvantage in the US than they would be in the absence
of the quota as the quota in e¤ect guarantees them a niche as long as they are not too ine¢ cient. Their ine¢ ciency

6

Thus, Bangladesh did not have any trade preferences in the US market and had to compete with
garment producers from other countries, such as India and China. However, since there were quotas
on other exporters as well, full competition among supplying countries was still not the case.
On the other hand, during the same period, the EU had an MFN tari¤ rate of 12-15% on the
various categories of apparel. Prior to 2001, apparel from Bangladesh entered the EU under the
Least Developed Countries (LDCs) status of the General System of Preferences (GSP) program
with a tari¤ preference of 100%. Thus, if the MFN tari¤ was 12%, under GSP, Bangladesh would
face no tari¤. There were no o¢ cial quotas, but exports were under surveillance, so that a surge
would likely result in quotas. In 2000, the EU formally announced that they would implement
the “Everything-But-Arms”(EBA) initiative in 2001, in which Bangladesh, together with 48 other
LDCs, would have access to the EU, duty and quota free, provided that the ROOs were satis…ed.
This e¤ectively removed any inklings of a quota and granted a 100% preference margin for garment
exports of Bangladesh to the EU. It signi…cantly improved the market environment, in which
Bangladesh garment exporters operated. For this reason, in the empirical section, we allow …rms’
behavior to di¤er in the pre- and post-EBA period.

A

Rules of Origin

ROOs specify constraints that must be met in order to obtain origin and thereby qualify for country
speci…c quotas or trade preferences.13 They can take a variety of forms. The important thing to
note is that, whatever the form, if ROOs are binding then the choice of inputs used in production
di¤ers from the unconstrained level. Hence, costs are higher if ROOs are met. Since more restrictive
ROOs constrain choices more than do less restrictive ones, an increase in restrictiveness raises the
minimized level of costs. Thus, from an analytical viewpoint, ROOs raise the production costs of
the product when they are binding.14 On the other hand, they may provide access to the market
at a lower tari¤ and this bene…t has to be traded o¤ against the cost.
US ROOs regarding apparel products are governed by Section 334 of the Uruguay Round
Agreements Act.15 For the purpose of tari¤s and quotas, an apparel product is considered as
reduces the price of their quota licenses, while the quota licenses of a very competitive country would be highly priced.
13
For a relatively comprehensive and up to date survey see Krishna (2006).
14
In the same spirit, though formally not in the model, meeting ROOs in Bangladesh forces producers to rely on
poorer quality domestic inputs (which make a lower quality garment with a lower price) rather than higher quality
imported ones in order to obtain preferences.

originating from a country if it is wholly assembled in the country. No local fabric requirement
is necessary. Thus, the products of a …rm are not penalized if the …rm chooses to use imported
fabrics. All apparel products are subjected to non-preferential tari¤s of about 20%, and prior to
January 2005, selected apparel categories were subjected to country-speci…c quota restrictions.
On the other hand, EU ROOs on apparel products are considerably more restrictive. According
to Annex II of the GSP (Generalized System of Preferences) guidebook, which details ROOs of
all products, for an apparel product to be considered originated from a country, it must start its
local manufacturing process from yarn16 , i.e., the use of imported fabrics in apparel products would
result in the product failing to meet the ROOs for the purpose of tari¤ and quota preferences under
GSP or EBA for the case of LDCs. It would, thus, be subject to MFN tari¤s of about 12% to 15%.
Within the garment industry, there are two major sub-industries, namely, non-woven (knitwear
and sweaters) and woven garments. Due to current production techniques, non-woven …rms are
able to manufacture garments from yarn. Thus, they can easily satisfy the ROOs of the EU and
can obtain tari¤ preferences at low cost. However, …rms making garments from woven material
(woven …rms) mostly assemble cut fabrics into garments. Given the limited domestic supply of
woven cloth17 , it commands a premium price, so that woven garment makers can meet ROOs
only by paying a roughly 20% higher price for cloth which translates into a signi…cantly higher
cost of production as cloth is a lions share of the input cost. The cost of cloth to FOB price is
roughly 70

75% for shirts, dresses, and trousers18 , so that this directly translates into a 15% cost

disadvantage.19 In contrast, US ROOs do not discriminate against the origin of fabrics: assembly
is all that is required. Nor does the US give tari¤ preferences to Bangladeshi garments, and the
presence of country speci…c quotas in most categories makes meeting ROOs mandatory for exports.
Thus, an item exported to the US may be considered as a product of Bangladesh and imported
under the quota allocation of Bangladesh. However, the same item may fail to meet the ROOs
of the EU and would not qualify for the 12-15% tari¤ preference under the EBA initiative. In
a nutshell, the EU is an easier market, especially in non-wovens, as neither quotas, nor domestic

Of 1320 million meters of total demand in 2001, only 190 was supplied locally in wovens, while 660 of 940 million
meters of knit fabric was supplied locally according to a study by the company, Development Initiative, in 2005.

In contrast, India has the ability to meet its woven cloth needs domestically at competitive prices so that its …rms
can avail themselves of GSP preferences in the EU. As a result, Bangladeshi …rms …nd themselves at a disadvantage
in woven garments.

The Data

We use two data sets. The …rst has complete customs data on all exporting garment …rms in
Bangladesh. This data was provided by the Bangladesh export authority. The second data set has
much more information, but is on a smaller set of exporters. It comes from a …rm level survey
which was conducted under the auspices of the World Bank and the Government of Bangladesh.20
The …rms in our survey data are also matched with the …rms in the exporters data set. This allows
us to perform a number of cross checks on the results based on the …rm level survey data.

A

Firm Level Export Data

The customs data set contains data on exports for all …rms that applied for Country of Origin
Certi…cates in 2004. This certi…cate is required by the importing countries to verify the origin of
the good and is needed to export and apply for trade preferences. Thus, this data set consists of
the whole population of exporting …rms in the garment industry of Bangladesh. It has information
on the 2387 garment …rms exporting in 2004. The total value of exports was US$11.6 billion, with
more than 400 million dozen garments exported. Overall, in terms of value, nearly 79% of garments
were exported to the EU, 10% to the US, and the remaining 11% went to other countries such as
Canada and Australia. Of the 2387 …rms, 1967 (82%) exported under the GSP (mostly to the EU),
and hence, met GSP ROOs: 1039 (43.5%) of the …rms exported to the US, of which 709 (29.7%)
exported under quota allocations, and 1231 (51.6%) …rms exported to other countries.21
If we consider the distribution of …rms by number of export destinations, we …nd that of all
exporting …rms, 47% only supply to one market, 34% supply to two markets, 14% to three markets,
and 5% to all four markets. Figure 1 presents the choice of export markets of Bangladesh garment
exporters according to the number of export markets the …rms supply. It is very clear that the EU
is the most popular destination, especially among …rms that have only one export market. Among
the 1109 …rms that only supply to one market, nearly 850 …rms (76%) concentrate on the EU. The
US market appears to be the toughest to break into: among this group of …rms, less than 8% only
20

The same data set is also used in Kee (2006) to study the horizontal productivity spillover e¤ects of FDI …rms
in the garment industries in Bangladesh.
21
The composition of US imports is biased towards knitwear, which are cheaper than sweaters so that the value
share of the US is less than its share in terms of …rms or output.

export to the US with and without quota. Thus, there seem to be signi…cant di¤erences in …rms
exporting to the EU and the US. Firms exporting to the US tend to export to many markets, while
those that sell to the EU tend to sell only to the EU.
Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz (2004) and (2008) study the export performance of French …rms.
Their work suggests that the number of markets a …rm supplies is positively correlated with its
value added per worker which re‡ects the productivity of the …rm. This is consistent with the
evidence in our data. Figure 2 plots the unit value of garment exports against the total export
value or the number of export destinations. Firms that export to more destinations have higher
average unit values and are larger in size.22 Both are positively correlated with value added per
worker. In this way, our data is consistent with their conjectures.

B

Firm Level Survey Data

The …rm level survey was conducted from the period of November 2004 to April 2005. It covers a
strati…ed random sample of 350 …rms, which is about 10% of the total population of the garment
…rms currently operating in Bangladesh. After cleaning the data to exclude outliers and …rms with
incomplete information, there are a total of 292 …rms in the unbalanced …nal panel of 1211, who
provided retrospective information about their operations from 1999 to 2003. In this unbalanced
panel, the composition of sub-industries of non-woven versus woven is 35% and 65%, respectively.23
Table 1 presents the sample means of the key variables by the sub-industries and export destinations (EU vs US). Firm capital stock, Kjt ; is constructed by summing real investment, Ijt ; over
the years using the perpetual inventory method with an annual depreciation rate, ; of 10%:

the purpose of this calculation, we assumed that the average investment in the …rst two years the
22

The di¤erences in unit values and total size among …rms with di¤erent number of markets are statistically
signi…cant.
23
How does this …rm survey data compare to the customs data set? For the …ve year sample period, it slightly
over-samples the US …rms, which tend to be larger, and under-samples the smaller …rms that only export to the EU.

…rm is observed in the data is a good approximation to the average investment of this …rm in the
years before it is observed. Firms’real investment, Ijt , is obtained by de‡ating nominal investment
from the …rm survey by the GDP de‡ator of domestic …xed capital formation of Bangladesh in
the respective years. Thus, by construction, Kjt is a …xed factor in year t that only depends on
information in year t

1; and is not a¤ected by any changes in t:

Three things stand out in Table 1. First, the woven …rms use signi…cantly more materials than
the non-woven …rms, suggesting that their production functions di¤er. We, thus, estimate the two
production functions separately. Second, we focus on two groups of …rms, those that only export
to the EU, “Only EU Exporters”(or OEU), and those that “Also Export to the US”, i.e., who sell
to both the EU and the US (or AUS). OEU …rms are smaller than AUS …rms in both industries
in all dimensions, except when it comes to investment in non-wovens, where the investment level
of OEU …rms is signi…cantly higher than that of AUS …rms, suggesting that non-woven …rms with
good EU demand shocks are in a position to take advantage of EU preferences obtainable at low
or no costs of meeting ROOs and hence, choose to invest there.
Finally, there are proportionately more OEU …rms in non-wovens than in wovens. This suggests
that the market environment the two industries are facing could be di¤erent due to the di¤erent
trade policy regime and the relevant ROOs.
Overall, non-woven …rms seem to behave very di¤erently both in terms of their sales to the US
and to the EU. Although the EU is the favored export destination for Bangladeshi …rms as a whole,
it is less so for …rms making woven garments. While only 58% of the sampled …rms exported at
least 5% of their output to the US, 76% of these made woven garments. On the other hand, while
88% of the sampled …rms export at least 5% of their output to the EU, about 65% of these made
woven garments. Despite this, only 68% of all …rms exporting woven garments were US exporters,
while 88% exported to the EU con…rming a EU bias even among woven …rms. This di¤erential
EU bias can be explained by the di¤erences in trade policy and ROOs in the two destinations
described in Section II, which make the EU by far the most preferred …rst market for Bangladeshi
…rms, especially for non-woven …rms.

IV

The Model

There has been an explosion of interest in heterogeneous …rm models in trade in the last few years.24
However, till recently, there were few theoretical models, at least general equilibrium ones, where
…rm heterogeneity played a major role. Quite recently, Melitz (2003), Bernard, Eaton, Jensen
and Kortum (2003), and Eaton and Kortum (2002) provided two quite di¤erent approaches to
incorporating …rm heterogeneity in a reasonably simple and meaningful way into such models.25
The assumptions made in the model below are based on the di¤erential ROOs and trade policies
in the US and EU described earlier. We will use a simple partial equilibrium setting based on the
setup in Melitz (2003). This will serve as the basis for the intuition behind the results. We …rst
set up the demand side. Then we explain how …rms behave in the presence of ROOs and provide
the intuition behind our results on the equilibrium e¤ects of ROOs. Finally, we describe how to
incorporate demand shocks into our model.

Pricing and Equilibrium

Q and P are taken as given by each …rm since there is a continuum of …rms. Firms di¤er in their
and, as a result, in a unit labor requirement of 1 : With wages set at unity, such

productivity level
a …rm has a cost of

1

. A …rm draws

independently from the density function g( ) after paying

an entry fee of fe : To produce in any given period, it must pay a …xed cost f: Once

is realized,

it stays with the …rm forever as long as it does not die. Pro…ts are zero if a …rm exits. To sum up,
each …rm …rst pays the entry fee, gets a draw of productivity, then decides whether to stay in or
not, and if it stays in, decides which markets to serve and how.
As each variety is symmetric, and a …rm is a monopolist over its variety, price depends only on
the productivity draw, not the variety per se, so pro…t maximization results in
p( ) =

price of goods produced. Moreover, as pro…ts rise with

…rms pay f to produce, as well as a marginal cost, low productivity …rms will exit so that only …rms

Firms are assumed to die at a constant rate , independent of age. A mass Me of …rms enters

Thus, if we know M and

makes …rms more

as consumers like variety. This completes the description of the closed economy equilibrium.

C

Trade and Trade Policy

Next we turn to how trade and trade policy can be incorporated into our model. Trade makes the
choices open to a Bangladeshi …rm more complex as …rms have additional choices: to export or not,
to invoke preferences or not if these are available, and which markets to export to? Fortunately,
since marginal costs are constant, decisions in each market are independent.
Assume a …rm must pay fx each period to export to any given market. In addition, exporters
face transport costs of the iceberg form of

> 1 and an ad valorem tari¤

i

0 set by country

i: It proves convenient to work with the tari¤ in terms of the consumer price denoted by ti =
i=

ti p per unit. Such a …rm chooses p to maximize

This is equivalent to choosing p to maximize the term in the square brackets, which is the pro…ts of
a domestic …rm in i with productivity

. Hence, the price chosen will be the pro…t maximizing

14

price of such a …rm. As a result, the price set by a Bangladeshi …rm with productivity
to market i; which has transport costs of

. The revenues (and pro…ts) of
ti

such a …rm are the same as those of a domestic …rm in i with a productivity 1

Since there are …xed costs, which can be more easily covered by more productive …rms with
larger sales, all …rms with productivity above a threshold
…rms with productivity above

will …nd it worth exporting and all

will produce for the domestic market. We assume that the cuto¤

for exports will exceed that for domestic production, so that only the more productive …rms will be
exporters. This requires …xed costs of exporting be large relative to those of producing domestically.
C.1

Incorporating Preferences and Quotas

How can ROOs be incorporated? Let the superscript i = B; U; E denote the level of the variable in
Bangladesh, the US, and the EU, respectively. If the Bangladeshi …rm meets ROOs in country i; its
i

cost of production for the export market is

per unit, where

i

> 1 to re‡ect the cost of meeting

ROOs in country i, i = U; E: In addition, in the EU it faces zero tari¤s, while in the US there are
no such preferences given, but as there are quotas, meeting ROOs is a necessary condition for all
Bangladeshi exporters. From these considerations alone, the revenue, and hence variable pro…ts, of
a …rm in Bangladesh with draw

that chooses to export to the US and meet ROOs is that of a

…rm situated in the US with draw 1

Note that for any …rm to choose to meet ROOs; 1

However, for a …rm exporting to the US, in addition to the ROOs that need to be met to obtain
origin and access the quota (which raises production costs), the quota license price has to be paid.
Since a quota license acts like a speci…c tari¤, we need to see how to incorporate a speci…c tari¤
into the model. If a …rm faced a speci…c tari¤, s, it would price as if its costs were

di¤erently from t: as it is a dollar amount, it raises the cost of high productivity …rms by a greater
percentage than that of low productivity ones. As a result, pro…ts increase more slowly with
than under an ad-valorem tari¤ as depicted in Figures 3 and 4.29
We now use these insights to develop the payo¤s of a Bangladeshi …rm given P and E:
C.2

Bangladeshi Firms Choices

Bangladeshi …rms have several options to choose from in terms of serving each of three potential
markets in our model, and a …rm serves a market if it makes positive pro…ts from doing so.
When it comes to a domestic market, …rms can produce or not. Thus, from this market they
get max 0; 1 r( ; P B ; E B )

f : As to exporting to the EU, they can choose not to do so, export

under EBA and meet ROOs, or not invoke preferences and pay the MFN tari¤. Let (1

Hence, the overall pro…ts of a Bangladeshi …rm are the sum of its pro…ts from the three markets:

BE (

BU (

literature, that fx is large enough that only the more productive …rms export and that similarly, d
is large enough that only the more productive exporters choose to meet ROOs.
Thus, the following must hold for any levels of E i and P i as depicted in Figures 3 and 4:
(1a)

B(

B(

Bi (

ensured by f + fx always being less than f + fx + d.
(2b)

Bi
xr

>

Bi
x .

Given ROOs are worth invoking, this boils down to d being large enough.

We can make some further comparisons, but these are more subtle. First, note that ceteris
paribus, an increase in the aggregate price index in a country, or an increase in its expenditure,
makes pro…ts as a function of

steeper. A more restrictive trade policy, i.e., a rise in transport

costs ( ); a dilution of preferences (a rise in

so preferences are more costly to obtain) or a more

restrictive quota (an increase in s); makes the pro…t function ‡atter.
Since the aggregate price index is endogenous, to proceed further, we need to understand how
di¤erences in trade policy should be expected to a¤ect the price index, and thus, the various cuto¤
levels (the

’s) we are interested in. If the price index falls as trade policy becomes more restrictive,

then the price index in the US will be below that in the EU. In this event, both the more restrictive
trade policy and the lower price index will make pro…ts in the US ‡atter than in the EU.
That more restrictive trade policy leads to a lower, rather than higher aggregate price index
seems counter-intuitive, but is exactly what is predicted in these heterogeneous …rm models. Melitz
and Ottaviano (2008) show that a more protectionist stance increases the market potential of a

Note that r stands for ROOs and x for exports. Exporting to the US without meeting ROOs is not an option.

17

country and results in more …rms locating there, more varieties competing with each other, and
hence, a lower price index. Some evidence that this occurs can be found in Chen et al. (2009) who
show that for EU countries, trade openness seems to exert a competitive e¤ect in the short run,
with prices and markups falling. However, consistent with the predictions in Melitz and Ottaviano
(2008), these e¤ects diminish, and may even be reversed, in the longer run as more protected
economies attract entry.
Invoking this result of Melitz and Ottaviano yields that pro…ts from exporting to the US are
lower than those from exporting to the EU and this makes the export cuto¤s of Bangladeshi …rms
for the US higher than those for the EU. Moreover, this gap between the export cuto¤s in the US
and the EU will be larger (as the di¤erence in slopes will be greater) the larger the di¤erence in
the trade policy stances. Thus, the di¤erence in the export cuto¤s for Bangladeshi …rms exporting
to the US and EU in non-wovens will be magni…ed relative to that in wovens, and as a result, we
expect to see a greater fraction of …rms selling only to the EU in non-wovens.
We construct Figures 3 and 4 to re‡ect these di¤erences in trade policy stances in the two
industries.31 Both greater protection and a lower price index in the US work in the same direction:
namely, to ‡atten the pro…t curves of a Bangladeshi …rm from selling in the US relative to those
from selling in the EU. Thus, we also know that (as P is lower in the US):

In the woven industry, see Figure 3, there are fewer advantages of selling in the EU relative to
selling in the US. Meeting ROOs does not give as much of a bene…t because they are costly to meet
in wovens. Hence, the line for exporting and obtaining preferences to the EU starts out below that
for exporting without meeting ROOs, but is not much steeper. It is also not much steeper than
the line for exporting to the US (where ROOs must be met but are less onerous). As a result,
few …rms choose to export to the EU and meet the ROOs; i.e.,

BE

where …rms are indi¤erent

between exporting to the EU with and without ROOs, is quite high. It is also signi…cantly larger

where …rms are indi¤erent between exporting under ROOs to the U S and not doing

Adding Demand Shocks

It is worth noting that the model as it stands predicts that if the US is a tougher market than
the EU (since trade policy is more restrictive and the price index is lower), there should be no
…rms who export only to the US. However, there are a small number of …rms of this kind in our
data.32 This can be incorporated into the model by allowing …rms to also di¤er in terms of market
speci…c demand shocks. A positive demand shock in a market will, other things constant, increase
pro…ts in that market. Consequently, in Figures 3 and 4, for example, a more positive US demand
shock will raise pro…ts and reduce the productivity level needed to export to the US. The cuto¤
productivity for exporting to the US will, thus, depend on the demand shock obtained by the …rm.
A …rm with a given productivity but a particularly favorable US market demand shock along with
an unfavorable EU market demand shock might, thus, choose to sell to the US and not the EU.
We incorporate demand shocks by allowing randomness in the utility function in each market.
For each market i; the utility function is still given by (1), but now we de…ne Qi as

One cannot dismiss them as random error, as they tend to be quite large in size, especially in non-wovens.

19

As before, Qi and P i are taken as given by each …rm, since there is a continuum of them. The
timing of the game is as follows. In stage 1, …rms pay an entry fee of fe ; and draw their productivity
level

from the density function g( ): Once

is realized, it stays with the …rm forever as long as

it does not die. It is also common across all the markets the …rm serves. After observing its ;
each …rm decides whether to enter each particular market. If its productivity is high enough to
enter this market, it pays a …xed cost of fm and draws a demand shocks v i speci…c to this …rm
from the distribution H (v). We assume that each shock v i is i.i.d. and comes from the cumulative
distribution H (v) ; which is the same across countries and …rms. Based on

and

i;

a …rm decides

how much to sell in this market, which entails a further …xed cost of production, f . In other words, a
…rm’s decision on whether to sell in a market depends on the realization of …rm speci…c productivity,
; which is common among the markets the …rm is selling, as well as the market speci…c demand
shock, v i ; in each market. In addition, these two realizations a¤ect a …rm’s decision about which
option to use to sell in the market (e.g., to invoke ROOs or not). As shown in Kee and Krishna
(2008), given that the demand shock enters the demand function (11) multiplicatively, it will not
a¤ect the price of each variety, and price depends only on the productivity draw.
To summarize, we have 3 stages of a …rm’s decision making in the model: In the …rst stage,
…rms decide whether to pay the …xed costs of …nding out their productivity. If it is worth it, they
pay fe ; enter and get a productivity draw : In the second stage, knowing ; they decide whether
to spend fm to enter each market and get a …rm speci…c demand shock v i there. In the third stage,
they decide whether to operate in this market, and if it is pro…table, they pay the …xed cost of
production, f; and start selling there.
As usual, the model can be solved backwards. In the third stage, for …rms with productivity
; which enter market i, we can de…ne a demand shock cuto¤, v i ( ) ; such that only …rms, which
receive a demand shock v i > v i ( ) ; can cover the …xed costs of selling in this market and earn
non-negative pro…ts

; v i ; P i > 0. For any productivity level, ; the equilibrium demand shock

cuto¤, v i ( ) ; solves the following zero-pro…t condition:
;v i ( );Pi =

r

;v i ( );Pi

f = 0:

(13)

Then in the second stage, …rms, which know only their productivity , compare the expected
pro…ts from entering market i and getting a demand shock draw with the …xed costs of doing so,

20

being the exogenous death rate of …rms, which is used as a discount factor for the future

pro…ts. This gives the mass of …rms that enter and allows us to solve for the endogenous variables
P i and Qi . This completes the description of the equilibrium.
The di¤erences in trade policies described above can be incorporated into the model with
demand shocks the same way as before. The only di¤erence is that instead of productivity cuto¤s,
now we have demand shock cuto¤s at any given productivity level in stage 3. This is de…ned as
v i ( ) in (13) ; which is a downward sloping loci for each of the market. Only …rms above the locus
will serve a market (provided that their productivity is also above the entry cuto¤ in stage 2).
Easier trade policy such as that of the EU in the non-woven sector, causes the locus to be closer
to the origin and thus allows the less productive …rms to be in the market at any given demand
shock level. Moreover, ROOs are still more pro…table to meet for …rms with higher productivity
at a given demand shock level. Thus, the introduction of demand shocks does not change our
predictions for the productivity cuto¤s, given demand shocks.

D

Predictions

The predictions of our model can be summarized as the following.
21

Prediction 1 (Sorting across markets):
(a) Conditioning on demand shocks, as the US is the tougher market, the productivity cuto¤ for
Bangladeshi …rms exporting to the US should exceed that for exporting to the EU. Hence, within
an industry, we should see …rms sort across markets on the basis of their productivity, namely,
more productive …rms should export to the US and EU, while less productive ones should export
only to the EU.
(b) This sorting should be more evident in non-wovens, where the trade policy stance of the US
and EU di¤ers by more.
Thus, between industries, we look for evidence consistent with the fact that, given demand
shocks, cuto¤ productivities should di¤er more in non-wovens. As a result of this prediction, the
proportion of …rms that export to the US should be smaller than that of …rms who export to the
EU in both wovens and non-wovens, but especially in non-wovens, where the trade policies in the
US and EU are further apart. This is supported by the evidence in Table 1. Firms that export to
the EU include both OEU …rms and AUS …rms, while …rms that export to the US include AUS
…rms and OUS …rms.
Prediction 2 (Sorting by mode of market access):
(a) Among …rms exporting to the EU, the more productive …rms choose to meet ROOs, conditioning on demand shocks.
(b) This should be especially so in wovens, where ROOs are costly to meet, so that only the
most productive …rms …nd it worthwhile to meet them.
We expect to see the fraction of …rms who sell to the EU and invoke ROOs being higher in
non-wovens. By matching the customs data set and the …rm survey we …nd that while 58 percent
of the …rms in non-wovens who sell to the EU invoke ROOs, only 40 percent do so in wovens.
Adding demand shocks also provides additional predictions which can be veri…ed in the data.
Prediction 3 (Demand Shocks versus Productivity):
Demand shocks play a greater role in determining the markets …rms serve when productivity
cuto¤s are close. Similarly, productivity plays a greater role in determining the markets …rms serve
when demand shocks are controlled for. This implies that the sorting of …rms across markets,
described in Prediction 1, should be stronger when demand shocks are controlled for.
An implication of Prediction 3 is that when export productivity cuto¤s are similar across markets there are likely to be more OUS …rms. This follows from demand shocks being the force that
creates OUS …rms and their playing more of a role in determining the markets served when produc22

tivity cuto¤s are close. This is consistent with the fact that 3 percent of …rms in non-wovens are
OUS …rms compared to 10 percent in wovens. Moreover, as large favorable US demand shocks will
be required to create OUS …rms in non-wovens, such …rms should be larger in size in wovens than
in non-wovens despite being less likely. These facts are documented in Kee and Krishna (2008).
To test the predictions of the model more formally, we now turn to estimating …rm productivity.

We assume that the following Cobb Douglas production function holds separately for woven and
non-woven industries (industry subscripts are omitted):
Yjt =

L

jt Ljt

MjtM KjtK ;

(15)

where j and t are the indices for …rm and year, respectively, and Yjt ; Ljt ; Mjt ; and Kjt are the
output, labor, materials, and capital of …rm j in year t: Output and material input are obtained by
de‡ating total sales and material cost using …rm speci…c price indices, which are constructed using
detailed price information from the …rm survey.33 The total factor productivity (TFP) of …rm j in
year t is

jt :

We assume that, in logs,

can be decomposed linearly into the following:

(16)

where ! jt is observable to a …rm at the beginning of each period before variable input choices are
made, but not to researchers. The year speci…c productivity,

t,

captures the e¤ect of time and

others factors that are common to all …rms during a year (within an industry) and
e¤ect of (log of) age on productivity. The last term,

…rms (but not to the researchers) before the variable input choices are made, it would tend to be
positively correlated with ljt and mjt , which would cause the least squares estimates of

L

and

M

to be biased upward. However, ! jt and mjt could be negatively correlated. For example, if more
productive …rms could manage to use less material to produce, the least squares estimate of

M

could be biased downwards. In addition, if larger, older …rms tend to stay in business despite low
productivity, while younger, smaller …rms tend to quit more easily, such endogenous exit decisions
on the part of …rms would bias the least squares estimates of the

A

and

K

downwards.

To address such input endogeneity and selectivity bias, Olley and Pakes (1996) (OP) derive a
3-step procedure to obtain consistent estimates of the

0 s:

In their model, …rms choose to exit or

not once they know their productivity. If they do not exit, they decide on how much to invest and
make other output and input decisions. Productivity, ! jt ; is assumed to be the only unobserved
state variable in each year t: It follows a common exogenous Markov process, which, jointly with the
…xed input, kjt , and its age, determines the exit decision and investment demand, ijt ; of the …rms in
each period. They consider the Markov perfect Nash equilibrium, so …rm’s expectations match the
realization of future productivity. Then a polynomial function of ijt ; kjt ; and (the log of ) age, ajt ;
can be used to proxy for the unobserved productivity, ! jt . This is possible because, given kjt and
ajt , ijt is increasing with ! jt ; which makes the investment function invertible. The assumption that
investment is monotonically increasing with the unobserved productivity is crucial, since without
it invertibility is not ensured. Furthermore, to control for the exit decision, they estimate a Probit
regression to obtain the survival probability and use it to control for selection bias.
In our current data set, it is likely that (in addition to the unobserved productivity) …rm’s
investment and exporting decisions also depend on market speci…c demand shocks that vary across
…rms. As pointed out in Kee and Krishna (2008), the fact that in non-wovens there exist OUS
…rms who are fewer in number, but larger in market share, is one such piece of evidence. Without
accounting for such demand shocks, investment may not be monotonic in productivity, which would
invalidate the use of the standard approach described above.
To accommodate these facts, we modify OP along the lines suggested by Ackerberg, Benkard,
Berry and Pakes (2007). Basically, what we do is extend OP from a scalar setup to a vector one.
Instead of having each …rm observe its productivity alone before making its output, sales, and
investment decisions, we have them observe …rm speci…c demand shocks in the US and the EU,
which together with their productivity would determine their actions, including their investment
decisions and export shares in the US and EU. If this vector function is invertible, we can obtain
24

productivity as a function of investment and export shares rather than just investment as in OP.
We assume that at the beginning of each period, each …rm observes its productivity, ! jt ; and
its demand shocks,

hypothesis that the estimated coe¢ cients on ljt+1 and mjt+1 are insigni…cant also indicates that
there are no systematic measurement errors in ljt and mjt that are correlated with …rm productivity.
The results of the regressions are reported in Table 2. Columns (1) to (3) present the results for
non-wovens, and (4) to (6) are for the woven industry.36 The OLS estimations with no correction
for endogeneity, selectivity, or year …xed e¤ects are reported in (1) and (4). These estimates are
quite strange, with the coe¢ cient for capital actually being negative, though not signi…cant. This
is to be expected, as we know these estimates are likely to be biased.
Columns (2) and (5) report the …rst stage results of the extended OP procedure, where a 3rd
order polynomial function of investment, capital, age, and export shares (which is allowed to di¤er
pre and post EBA) is included as a control for the unobserved …rm productivity, as well as the
year …xed e¤ects. For non-wovens, both the coe¢ cients on labor and materials are now lower
as expected, which suggests that the endogeneity issue was important. For wovens, while the
coe¢ cient on labor is lower, the coe¢ cient on materials is now higher. The higher estimate for

M

suggests that material input is negatively correlated with productivity in wovens. This could be
because high productivity …rms tend to be able to save on costly domestic materials used in order
to satisfy the ROOs requirement in the EU market under the EBA.
Given the estimates in Columns (2) and (5), Columns (3) and (6) show the third stage estimates
with correction for selectivity bias to obtain the estimates for the coe¢ cients on capital and age.
Relative to the OLS estimates in Columns (1) and (4), the estimated coe¢ cient on capital for
non-wovens rises from 0.121 to 0.209, while for wovens, it rises from -0.013 to 0.208 and is now
statistically signi…cant. The coe¢ cients on age, while positive, are not statistically signi…cant in
both industries.
Finally, coe¢ cients on labor and material in Columns (3) and (6) are not statistically signi…cant
U
suggesting that ^t kjt ; ajt ; ijt ; xE

there is no systematic measurement errors in labor and materials.37

Zero sales in a market for a …rm mean that its demand shock for that market was too small for
it to export there, given its productivity. For observations with zero demand, demand shocks are
inferred by the following procedure suggested by the model. First, we group …rms into 10 di¤erent
decile intervals according to their productivity level within the same industry and year. We do so
because the minimum shock needed to export to a market depends on its productivity. We then
identify the minimum demand shocks (constructed according to (32) observed for exporter to a
market in each decile). We then …ll in for the missing demand shocks for …rms not exporting to
the market using a draw from a uniform distribution from the interval from zero to the minimal
observed demand shock for exporters to that market in that decile. We further remove industry
and year means from

i
jt

to isolate shocks that are truly unique to …rm j in each year.

Table 4 presents the sample averages of the estimated productivity and demand shocks by
industry and …rm type. In addition to OEU and AUS exporters de…ned earlier, we classify those
…rms that do not export to the EU, but export to the US, as only-US exporters (OUS). Here we can
see some interesting patterns. Within non-wovens, OEU …rms have the lowest TFP, follow by the
AUS …rms and then the OUS …rms. However, the reverse ordering holds in wovens: OEU …rms are
more productive than AUS and OUS …rms. This result highlights the importance of incorporating
demand shocks in the model as a factor in determining the export destinations of the …rms. The
woven industry is the older one in Bangladesh. Older woven …rms could have better contacts in
the US, and hence, better demand shocks, and export there despite having lower TFP.
In both industries, EU demand shocks are larger for OEU …rms than for AUS ones.42 US
demand shocks are larger for OUS than for AUS …rms. OEU …rms in non-wovens, on average,
41

Note that these cannot be said to be “small” relative to usual estimates of import demand elasticities as we
estimate …rm level elasticities which captures the substitutability between this …rms product and that of all other
…rms in the industry. They do not capture the response of a change in the industry price index on demand for the
industry’s product, which is what is usually estimated.
42
By construction, OUS …rms will have the lowest EU demand shocks.

30

have smaller positive EU demand shocks than do OEU …rms in wovens. This is consistent with
non-wovens being an easier market than wovens in the EU. Similarly, OUS …rms in non-wovens
have a higher US demand shock than do OUS …rms in wovens consistent with the idea that it takes
a really big positive demand shock to make a …rm an OUS one in non-wovens as the EU is such
an attractive market in this subindustry. We will test more formally the role of productivity and
demand shocks in explaining exporter status below.

Regression Analysis

C.1

Within Industry Analysis

Table 5 presents the results of probit regressions where we regress the export destinations of the
…rms on their productivity and its squares, controlling for year …xed e¤ects, …rm size, and age. Given
that …rm productivity is estimated with error, the bootstrapped standard errors are reported. The
standard errors are also clustered by industry, year, location, and capacity of the …rms in order to
take into account any correlation among observations within the sampling clusters. In Columns (1)
to (6) we run a variety of probits, without controlling for demand shocks. In Columns (7) to (12)
we run them again, controlling for demand shocks.
The dependent variables of Columns (1) and (4) equal one if the …rm only exports to the EU
in non-wovens and wovens, respectively. Our model predicts that in non-wovens, productivity
di¤erences should play a greater role in determining whether …rms are OEU or not, while in
wovens, demand shocks should play a greater role. In non-wovens there should be large productivity
di¤erences in OEU and non OEU …rms, given the demand shock, while in wovens they would be
smaller. This is consistent with the estimates. An increase in the productivity of a …rm signi…cantly
decreases the probability the …rm is an OEU one, especially in non-wovens. An increase in the EU
demand shock signi…cantly increases the probability a …rm is an OEU one and this is more so in
wovens as is evident from Columns (7) and (10).
Similarly, in Columns (2) and (5) the dependent variable is one if the …rm sells to both the EU
and the US in non-wovens and wovens, respectively. It is not the reverse of what is done in Columns
(1) and (4) as a non-OEU …rm could be a …rm that only exports to the US, or a …rm that exports
to a third market. Here we …nd that an increase in productivity increases the probability that the
…rm is an AUS …rm in non-wovens but this is not signi…cant, while this e¤ect is signi…cant and
positive in wovens. The result in Column (2) may be due to the fact that we may have an omitted

31

variable bias as demand shocks are not controlled for. The dependent variable in Columns (3) and
(6) equals one if the …rm only exports to the US (OUS-exporters). Again, we do not control for
demand shocks. These two columns show that productivity is not important at all in determining
which …rms only export to the US when demand shocks are not controlled for.
In Columns (7) to (12), demand shocks are estimated from (32) as discussed. Note that as
expected from our model, productivity di¤erences play a greater role in determining whether …rms
are OEU or not in non-wovens than in wovens (-3.945 versus -.742), while EU demand shocks play
a greater role in doing so in wovens (where productivity cuto¤s are closer) relative to non-wovens
(.569 versus .163)! In all cases, these demand shocks are extremely important in explaining export
destinations of the …rms. When a …rm has a favorable demand shock in the US, the probability of
the …rm being an OEU one decreases signi…cantly, while the probability of the …rm being either an
AUS or OUS increases signi…cantly. Conversely, positive EU demand shocks increase the likelihood
of a …rm being an OEU or AUS exporter, but decrease the likelihood of being an OUS …rm.
More importantly, controlling for demand shocks signi…cantly improves the explanatory power
of productivity for …rm exporter status, particularly for the AUS …rms in non-wovens and OEU
…rms in wovens. Thus, the results of this table show that controlling for demand shocks, as the
productivity of a …rm increases, the likelihood that this …rm only exports to the EU decreases, while
the likelihood of this …rm also exports to the US increases. These results are common across both
woven and non-woven industries, but the marginal e¤ects of productivity on export destination
choices are larger for the non-wovens.
To test the hypothesis that AUS …rms are more productive than OEU …rms, we …rst regress
…rm productivity on an AUS/OEU …rm dummy variable, which equals zero if it is an OEU …rm
and one if it is an AUS …rm. These results are presented in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 6 for
non-wovens and wovens, respectively. In non-wovens, the average productivity of an AUS …rm
is signi…cantly higher than that of an OEU …rm with point estimate equals to 0.22. However, in
wovens, the productivity advantage of an AUS …rm over that of an OEU …rm is found to be negative
and insigni…cant. These results are likely to be biased downwards given that we do not control for
demand shocks, since …rms with favorable demand shocks in the US will be able to export to the
US despite low productivity draws. Columns (3) and (4) include demand shocks in the regression.
As suspected, the estimated average productivity of an AUS …rm increases in both industries.
Columns (5) and (6) further control for …rm size, age, and the exposure to the EU and US
market (export shares in these markets), in addition to market demand shocks. For non-wovens,

the productivity advantage of AUS …rms over OEU …rms is now on average 33 percent (=exp(0.282)1), while for wovens, it is 40 percent. Thus, we …nd evidence that controlling for demand shocks
and other …rm attributes, AUS …rms are more productive than OEU …rms in both industries.
Are …rms that satisfy ROOs more productive than other …rms in the same market when ROOs
are binding? The information with regards to which …rms meet ROOs is available in the customs
data for 2004. By matching this data with that in the …rm survey in 2003 using …rm names, we
isolated a subset of 46 OEU …rms in wovens, of which 25 met ROOs in 2004. Column (7) compares
the productivity of these …rms to those OEU …rms in wovens that do not meet ROOs, controlling
for demand shocks, …rm age, and size. The results show that the …rms that invoke GSP preferences,
and hence, must satisfy ROOs are on average 40 percent (=exp(0.338)-1) more productive than
…rms that did not meet ROOs.43 Thus, the evidence supports the hypothesis that, when ROOs
are binding as it is in the case of wovens, only the more productive …rms choose to meet ROOs.
C.2

Between Industry Analysis

Our model predicts that, given that the cuto¤ productivities for the EU and the US markets are
further apart for non-wovens, there should be proportionately more OEU …rms in non-wovens for
any given demand shock. Furthermore, controlling for demand shocks and other …rm attributes,
the productivity di¤erences between OEU …rms and other …rms should be larger in non-wovens.
Table 7 performs the cross industry comparison using a di¤erence-in-di¤erence approach. In
Column (1) we regress the AUS dummy on a woven industry …xed e¤ect. The estimated coe¢ cient
is the additional proportion of AUS …rms in wovens relative to that of non-wovens. Without any
controls, the regression shows that the woven industry has 18 percent more AUS …rms than the
non-woven industry. Column (2) controls for demand shocks, together with …rm size and age, but
we still …nd that there are proportionately more AUS …rms in wovens than in non-wovens. This
…nding is consistent with the theoretical prediction.
In Column (3) we regress the estimated …rm TFP on a woven industry dummy, an OEU dummy,
and the interaction term between the two. The results show that OEU …rms are signi…cantly less
productive than other …rms in non-wovens, but not necessarily so in wovens. Column (4) further
controls for demand shocks and other …rm attributes. The results are even stronger here. While
OEU …rms are less productive in general, the productivity di¤erence is less in wovens than in non43

Given that most …rms meet ROOs in non-wovens, we cannot perform the same analysis there.

33

wovens. This result is consistent with the observation that while the trade policy regime in term
of wovens is similar in both the EU and the US markets, it is considerably less restrictive for nonwovens in the EU market. Such between industry di¤erences in the trade policy environment allow
more ine¢ cient OEU …rms to operate in the EU market for non-wovens, causing the productivity
di¤erences between OEU …rms and the other …rms to be larger in non-wovens.

D

Stochastic Dominance Tests

Can we say more about the productivity di¤erential between AUS and OEU …rms within the
same industry? The analysis so far has focused on estimating average productivity di¤erences but
our theory suggests that the productivity distribution of AUS …rms should …rst order stochastic
dominate (FOSD) that of OEU …rms within the same industry. Table 8 tests this hypothesis using
a nonparametric test for …rst order stochastic dominance by Anderson (1996). This is a multiple
comparison test based on the 10 decile intervals of the pooled distribution.
To control for demand shocks and other …rm attributes, we …rst regress the AUS/OEU dummy
variable in a probit regression by industry on the EU and US demand shocks, …rm size and age,
as well as year …xed e¤ects. We compare the predicted status with the actual, and only keep the
following two groups of …rms:44 those AUS …rms that were predicted by demand shocks and other
…rm attributes to be OEU …rms, and those OEU …rms that were predicted to be AUS …rms. If the
model is correct, then the AUS …rms we keep should be those with such a high productivity that
they export to the US despite adverse US demand shocks. Similarly, the OEU …rms we keep should
be so unproductive that they remain OEU exporters despite having good demand shocks in the US.
The AUS/OEU status of these two groups of …rms is least likely to be driven by demand shocks or
other …rm attributes. There are 60 non-woven …rms and 48 woven …rms in these subsamples.
Table 8 compares the productivity distribution of OEU …rms (distribution A) to that of the
AUS …rms (distribution B). Positive numbers in each decile interval imply that the cumulative
distribution A lies above B; and vice versa. The result for non-wovens is shown in Column (1).
Seven out of ten elements are positive, and two are statistically signi…cant, which suggests that the
productivity distribution of AUS …rms FOSD that of OEU …rms. Likewise for wovens in Column
(2), where nine out of ten elements are positive and …ve are statistically signi…cant. Results based
on the bootstrapped bias-corrected con…dence intervals are very similar. Overall the results based
44

Cuto¤ probability is selected such that the proportion of predicted AUS …rms is the same as the actual one.

34

on these multiple comparison tests support our theoretical model that conditioning on demand
shocks the productivity distribution of AUS …rms FOSD that of OEU …rms in both industries.

VI

Conclusion

Our …ndings are important for a number of reasons. First, our theoretical work is the …rst to
introduce …rm and market speci…c demand shocks as an additional dimension into heterogeneous
…rm models and to predict how …rms would tend to sort themselves across markets in response to
di¤erences in trade policy, preferences, and the costs of obtaining these preferences. Second, we
are also the …rst to test for these predictions in the data, by modifying the productivity estimation
procedure to take into account the in‡uence of …rm-market speci…c demand shocks.
Third, our work shows how the apparently liberal preferences provided by developed countries
may well be far less liberal than they seem. In the case of Bangladesh, such preferences may
also have encouraged an industry (non-wovens), in which Bangladesh was not as competitive or
does not have a natural comparative advantage. While preferences are in place, they shelter and
tolerate ine¢ cient …rms, which otherwise may not have been able to compete head-to-head with
…rms from other countries. Once preference margins are removed, as it is the case with the MFA
phase out, where quotas of other countries exporting to the EU were removed after 2006, intensi…ed
competition may force those ine¢ cient …rms from Bangladesh to leave the market. This is less likely
for those …rms exporting to the US with no preferences. Early evidence suggests that these …rms
are better able to survive in the US post MFA, which is consistent with their being better …rms.

Appendix
Firm Level Price Indexes

To estimate the …rm’s production function, we need to measure …rm output and material input,
which are constructed by de‡ating total values of sales and materials with output and material
input price indexes, respectively. Due to the lack of data, industry level price indexes have long
been used in the literature in place of …rm price indexes. There are obvious problems in using
them to de‡ate …rm sales and material costs. For example, in our model more productive …rms
will charge a lower price. As such, using an industry price index, which re‡ects the average price
level of all …rms in the industry, to de‡ate sales of the more productive …rms will underestimate
the output level, and in turn, a …rm’s productivity. Furthermore, to the extent that di¤erences in
…rm prices re‡ect di¤erences in the quality of their products, quality di¤erences across …rms will
be wiped out by using an industry price index. Similar issues arise for the input price index.
A unique strength of our data is the fact that we have data on prices at the …rm level, which
allows us to construct …rm speci…c price index that are consistent across years and …rms. Eslava,
Haltiwanger, Kugler and Kugler (2004) construct a Tornqvist price index for each …rm which is
consistent within …rms over time. The …rm price index is a weighted average of unit value changes
for each of the product the …rm produces in each year, with weights that re‡ect the average share of
the product in total sales of the …rms in two consecutive years. However, by setting each …rm price
index equal to 1 in the base year, cross …rm variation is ignored. This can hide …rm heterogeneity
in terms of product quality to the extent that the price level re‡ects quality.
In our …rm survey we have data on the value and quantity of the …ve main products for each
…rm in 2003. We can, thus, construct a weighted average unit value of products for each …rm in
2003 with weights re‡ecting the share of each product in the total sales of the …rm. This will be the
…rm product price level in 2003. The industry price level in 2003 is constructed by taking the …rm
sales weighted average of the …rm price level. By dividing the …rm price level by the industry price
level, we obtain a cross sectional …rm price index in 2003. Firms that have a price level higher than
the industry price level will have a …rm price index in 2003 exceeding unity. Conversely, …rms that
have a price level less than that of the industry in 2003 will have a …rm price index below unity.
In this manner, the cross sectional price index will capture …rm heterogeneity in 2003. Finally,
to extend the …rm price index to the previous years, we rely on the information provided by the
…rms in the survey regarding the annual change in price of their main product. In this way, the

39

constructed multi-year …rm price index will be consistent within …rms across years, as well as across
…rms within a year. A similar procedure is used to construct …rm speci…c material price index.
We use these …rm level product and material price indices to de‡ate total sales and material
costs of the …rms to obtain output and material inputs of the …rms for the production function
estimation. Note that, by construction, …rms that have higher quality products (or more services
per good), and thus, higher prices will have a higher …rm price index. By de‡ating total sales
using this …rm price index, we obtain an output measurement that is quality free, i.e., is in terms
of “e¤ective units” of the good. Thus, our productivity estimates will not be contaminated by the
quality of the …rm’s products. This is a known problem in the existing literature when an industry
price index is used to de‡ate …rm sales.

Testing for Stochastic Dominance

We use a nonparametric test of stochastic dominance, developed in Anderson (1996), to test whether
the productivity distributions of …rms serving di¤erent markets in di¤erent industries are indeed
statistically di¤erent as predicted by our model. Given that this is a relatively new technique, we
will brie‡y describe the methodology, which is an extension of the Pearson goodness of …t test.
Let

be the rangespace of two productivity distributions A and B, with cumulative density

functions FA ( ) and FB ( ) : Distribution A …rst order stochastically dominates (FOSD) B i¤

FB ( ) ; FA ( i ) 6= FB ( i ) ; for some i; 8 2 :

(33)

That is, that the CDF of A does not exceed that of B: To test the hypothesis, …rst, the range of the
two distributions is partitioned into J mutually exclusive and exhaustive intervals with respective
relative frequency vectors pA and pB ; where pi = p1i ; :::; pJi ; and

The test that distribution A FOSD B boils down to:

pB < 0;

(37)

where under H0 ; distributions A and B are statistically the same, whereas under H1 , distribution
A statistically FOSD B: It is possible that the test does not support either H0 or H1 ; in which
case, while distribution A is not the same as B; we could not say one distribution FOSD the other,
which leads to the conclusion of indeterminacy in stochastic dominance.

statistically less than 0, then stochastic dominance of distributions A and B is undetermined. We
use this test coupled with the
