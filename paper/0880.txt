Introduction

The recent spate of papers analyzing height—by-age data has left some
economists and historians uneasy about the methodology employed and the

meaning of the results.' Although the papers typically include a discussion of human growth and its determinants, scholars unfamiliar with this
literature have difficulty assessing the behavioral significance of cross-

sectional differences or time profiles of height. One solution to this
problem has been to conduct or to propose height-by-age studies of various
populations with the objective of establishing a benchmark of performance

against which other populations can be compared. Height differences
among U.S. whites, slaves, and some Europeans during the nineteenth century,
for example, reveal that U.S. whites undoubtably had environmental advantages.

The advantages enjoyed by U.S. whites may be explained by diet, caloric
intake relative to physical exertion, the disease environment, public health

measures, etc. Any discussion along these lines must also address the possible

role of genetic factors. While efforts in this direction are essential for
understanding the details of these societies, interpreting the results in
these terms probably requires a greater commitment to the literature of human
biology than most economists and historians are willing to make.

As an aid to interpreting the results of height—by—age studies, it would
be helpful to compare and contrast height with other measures of well—being.

This paper investigates the relationship between height and per capita income.
Height is an index of nutrition and health that depends largely on income.

The connections among height, nutrition, and health, and among nutrition,

health, and income are considered separately. Empirical analysis rests on
56 height studies and per capita income estimates for 20 countries.

Nutrition, Health; and Height

Human growth from birth to maturity follows a well—defined pattern.2
The change in height, or velocity, is greatest during infancy, falls sharply,

and then ordinarily declines into the pre-adolescent years. During adolescence velocity rises sharply to a peak that equals approximately one-half of
the velocity during infancy, then falls sharply and reaches zero at maturity.
In girls the adolescent growth spurt begins about two years earlier, and the

magnitude of the spurt is smaller than in boys. Girls and boys are about
the same height prior to the spurt.

The height of an individual reflects the interaction of genetic and

environmental influences during the period of growth. According to Eveleth
and Tanner:

Such interaction may be complex. Two genotypes which produce the same adult height under optimal environmental circumstances may produce different heights under circumstances

of privation. Thus two children who would be the same height
in a well—off community may not only be smaller under poor

economic conditions, but onemay be significantly smaller
than the other.... If a particular environmental stimulus is
lacking at a time when it is essential for the child (times
known as 'sensititive periods') then the child's development may
be shunted as it were, from one line to another'3
Although genes are important determinants of the heights of individuals,
studies involving genetically similar and dissimilar populations under various environmental conditions suggest that differences in average height
across most populations are largely attributable to environmental factors.

Using data from various social classes and several developed and developing countries, Habicht et al., argue that heiqht (and weic'ht) standards chosen to rep—

3

resent optimal pre-school growth can be drawn from studies of well-off
children, regardless of race or ethicity, because "any racial or ethnic
effect on mean preschool growth is small compared with environmental effects.4 In

a review of studies covering populations in Europe, New Guinea, and Mexico, Malcolm
concludes that "although the overall pattern such as the sex difference, the

adolescent spurt and the general shape of the curves, is genetically determined, the differences between populations are almost entirely the product

of the environment."5 Although differences in average heights across many
populations are related primarily to environment, comparisons involving
Japanese adults are an exception that may have a substantial genetic basis;

well-off Japanese reach, an average, the 15th height centile of well-off
Britains.6
Physical growth is correlated with many environmental variables, but
in the final analysis most of them operate through nutrition and disease.7
Malnutrition combined with illness may produce a synergistic effect.8
Poorly nourished children are more susceptible to infection and infection

reduces the body's absorption of nutrients. The mortality rate from measles,
for example, is several times higher in malnourished compared to well nourished
children.

The sensitivity of growth to malnutrition or illness depends on the age

at which they occur. For a given degree of deprivation, the effects may be

proportional to the velocity of growth under optimal conditions)0 Thus
young children and adolescents are particularly sensitive to environmental

insults. At the end of a period of slow growth, normal height may be
restored by catch-up growth. If the treatment following slow growth is
insufficient for catch—up growth, normal adult height may be approached by

an extension of the growing period. Prolonged and severe deprivation

4

produces stunting, that is, a reduction in adult size.'1
Wartime famines demonstrate the effects of deprivation on growth.
The heights of German children of a given age declined by one to three
inches when their food consumption was restricted during World War
Adolescent heights also declined in Japan and the Soviet Union during

World War u)3
Income, Nutrition, and Health
Caloric intake is a reasonably reliable indicator of nutrition.'4
Calories are a measure of the potential energy available for maintenance
of bodily functions and growth, and caloric consumption is correlated
with the intake of protein, mineral , and vitamin nutrients.

Income is the most important determinant of diet)5 Extremely poor
families may spend two—thirds or more of their income on food, but a high

proportion of a very low income purchases few calories. Malnutrition
associated with extreme poverty is known to have a major impact on height.
Once calorie requirements are satisfied, additional expenditures on food

purchase largely variety, palatability, and convenience. An income level

that is low by current European or North Merican standards is sufficient
to purchase enough calories to prevent retarded growth and stunting)6
Impoverished families can afford little medical care, and additional
income may have an important affect on health through control of infectious

diseases. While tropical climates have acquired a bad reputation for diseases,
King argues that poor health in developing countries is largely a consequence
of poverty rather than climate)7 There is a group of diseases which are

spread bynectors that need a warm climate, but poverty is responsible for the
lack of doctors, nurses, drugs, and equipment that combats these and other

diseases. Private expenditures per capita on health care are necessarily small
in developing countries and government expenditures per capita may be less than
11100 of those in industrialized countries.'8

S

Within industrialized countries height rises with income or Socio-

economic class.19 The differences in height may be related to expenditures
on health care. Expenditures on health services rise with income and there
is a positive relationship between health services and health.20

Height is also a function of the disease environment. This variable is
not measured easily, but one might argue that the expectation of life at birth

is a suitable prOxy that is independent of per capita income. In the data of
this study the correlation between the expectation of life at birth and the

log of per capita income is about .88, and consequently estimates of their

separate effects on height are unreliable. Although the regressions discussed
below include only the log of per capita income, the estimated coefficient of
this variable reflects the effect of both income and health.
The Data

The most comprehensive data on human growth are published in Eveleth

and Tanner, Worldwide Variation in Human Growth. This book summarizes and
interprets the results of numerous growth studies primarily undertaken during

the 1960s and 1970s. Tables in the appendix give the same type of information
for each study, including country, the qroups of people or place, date of
publication, height by year of age up to age 18 (heights are not available

for some ages), and adult height.21 The tables include several national
studies of height as well as studies of numerous smaller groups such as rural,

urban, student, military, poor, and rich residents. Studies of relatively
small groups such as tribes are excluded from this analysis on the basis that
little information is available about their per capita income relative to the
national average.

6

Extensive data on per capita income since 1950 for market—oriented

economies are available in Summers et al (l980).22 Per capita income
estimates for centrally planned economies were interpolated from World

Bank data.23 jam

is the source of data on income distribution.24 Unfo-

rtunately the match between height studies and income distribution studies
is not very complete; the overlap permits analysis of 56 height studies
in 20 countries.

Analysis

It is difficult to specify a priori the functional form of the
relationship between height and per capita income, although it is argued

below that it is probably nonlinear. At the individual level, extreme
poverty results in malnutrition, retarded growth, and stunting. Higher
incomes permit the purchase of a better diet, and height increases cor-

respondingly. Once income is high enough to satisfy caloric requirements,
there is little, if any, height gain available from changes in diet

related to higher incomes. Height may continue to increase with income,
however, because more or better medical care services are purchased. Consumption patterns change with income so that more and more of a person's
genetic potential is realized; once the potential is reached environmental

variables have no more effect. The limits to the process are apparent from
the fact that people who grew up in very wealthy families are not physical
giants.

If the relationship between height and income is non—linear at the indi-

vidual level, then the relationship at the aggregate of country level de-

pends on the distribution of income. Average height may differ for a given
per capita income depending, for example, on the fraction of people with

insufficient income to purchase adequate calories. Since the gain in height

7

at the individual level increases at a decreasing rate as a function of
income, one would expect average height at the country level to rise,
for a given per capita income, with the degree of equality of:the income

distribution (assuming that there are people who have not reached their

genetic potential). Food prices, the composition of the diet, knowledge
and standards of personal hygiene, public health measures that control
disease, the disease environment, as well as the amount of physical
exertion required to earn a given income, and intergenerational factors
(the length of time that a given per capita income has been sustained) may
all affect a country's average height at a given level of per capita income;
social and cultural values such as the pattern of food distribution within
the family, methods of preparation, and tastes and preferences for foods may
also be relevant.25

One should proceed with considerable caution, then, to estimate and
interpret the relationship between per capita income and average height

at the aggregate level. Despite the large number of factors that may
influence average height at a given level of per capita income, there is a

high correlation between these variables.26 The functional form ofthe relationship was explored by regressing average height on various polynominals

in per capita income and the log of per capita income. There is a substantial improvement in fit by going from the linear to the quadratic formulation, and a slight improvement by going from the quadratic to the cubic.
Because the semilog form fits approximately as well as the cubic and the

semilog is simpler, results are reported for the semilog formulation. Table 1
shows that the simple correlations between average height and the log of per

capita income are as high as .90. Data on per capita income are most compatible
with data obtained from national height studies; hence Table 1 includes only

8

those countries for which national height studies are available.27
The analysis can be expanded to include height studies of various
subsets of a country's population by employing a regression framework.
Adolescents and adults are examined separately because the independent

variables may have different effects on the heights of these groups. The
independent variables available, in addition to the log of per capita

income, include a Gini coefficient, dumy variables representing "poor",
"rich", urban, rural, university student, and military residents.28 The
urban, rural, and student variables may 'operate as proxies for income

because a relatively high proportion of the poor are located in rural areas,29
and university, students tend to come from high income families. The anticipated effect of military employment is ambiguous; some countries have
minimum height standards, universal service is required in others and the
bulk of the personnel in many countries is drawn from lower socio-econornic
classes.

The height studies involve populations of Europeans, Africans, Asians,
Indo—Mediterraneans, and people with European ancestory or African ancestory.3°
In view of the emphasis given to environmental as opposed to genetic deter-

minants of average height by human biologists, the dummy variables that
represent these classifications may capture largely environmental effects (other
than income) such as food prices, health care measures, the disease environment,
cultural factors, etc.

The heights of children aged 10 through 14 are particularly sensitive

to environmental influences. Children within this age group are included in
the regression by introducing dummy variables for ages 11 through 14. The
dummy variable representing sex has a genetic basis.

9

While it is safe to argue that causation runs

one way from per capita

income to the heights of children, per capita income and adult height are

determined jointly. Height is an index of health and nutrition, and the
health and nutrition of workers are known to affect output.31

Healthy

workers have greater physical vigor, fewer days lost from work, and longer

working lives. By using two stage least squares it is not necessary to
specify the complete model involving adult height and per capita income;
exogenous variables excluded from the height equations must be employed,

though, to identify the height equation. Any reasonable model of per capita
income determination would probably tnclude the value of the capital stock
per worker, a measure of human capital per worker, and the percentage of the

population of working age. Reliable estimates of the capital stock per
worker are available for only a few countries, and therefore the other exogenous

variables are used to identify the height equation. The adult literacy rate
is used as a measure of human capital. The adult literacy rate and the
percentage of the population of working age are available from the World
Bank.

The estimated equations are given in Table 2. The income variable, the
Gini coefficient variable, and the rural

,

poor,

and rich variables have the

expected signs.32 The negative sign of the urban variable may reflect large
migration from rural to urban areas; many urban areas also have large numbers

of poor people.33 Minimum height standards may dominate the effects of the
military variable. The coefficient of the female variable is positive among
adolescents probably because girls begin the growth spurt earlier than boys.

The ethnic variables may capture possible genetic differences, but in view
of the important role attributed to environment by human biologiests, envir-

onmental factors may underlie the results. Among adults the ethnic variables
have no statistically significant effect, but among children all ethnic
variables are negative and four out five are are statistically significant.

10

This finding may reflect that fact that children are relatively sensitive
to the environment; some deprivation in childhood may be overcome by an

extension of the growing period. Our understanding of environmental
consequences would be improved by analysis of individual level data.

Some relationships between height and per capita income that are
implied by the regressions in Table 2 are shown in Table 3.

It should be

recalled that the log of per capita income is highly correlated with the
expectation of life at birth, and therefore the coefficient of the log

of per capita income reflects both income and health. The estimated relationships apply to people with European ancestors; the Gini coefficient was

evaluated at the sample mean. Height is particularily sensitive to income
at low income levels. hnong boys age 12, for example, height increases by
6.7 centimeters as per capita income increases from $150 to $1,000, whereas
the gain is 5.7 centimeters as per capita income increases from $1,000 to
$5,000.

The relationships in Tables 2 and 3 should be interpreted with

considerable caution. Average height should not be used to infer per
capita income because per capita income is only one determinant of average

height. The relationships given in Table 3 change as a function of the
income distribution, place of residence, and ethnic group. The coefficients
in Table 2 show that average height is particularly sensitive to the income
distribution; an increase of 0.1 in the Gini coefficient reduces average

adult height more than 3 centimeters. Analyses of fluctuations or
differences in the heights of populations should consider the possible
role of the income distribution, or the distribution of variables such as
nutrition that determine height.

•11

The equations shown in Table 2 are based on mid—twentieth

century

data, and it is likely that different coefficients would be obtained from

data for earlier time periods. Improved medical

technology probably shifted

the relationship between average height and per capita income. Knowledge
of the germ theory of disease, for example, enabled individuals to improve
health, and therefore increase height, with no change in income.

The difficulties of using the regression coefficients based on crosssectional data to interpret historical time series are illustrated by the
li. S. case. Troops who fought in the American Revolution were nearly as

tall as World War II U.S. troops,34 yet per capita income was several
times higher during the later period. A change in the distribution of
income towards greater inequality may explain a portion of the apparent

contradiction.35 Despite the fact that per capita income was low during
the mid 1700s there may have been sufficient income for most people to

achieve or nearly achieve their genetic potential. The coefficient in
Table 2 implies that a reduction in the Gini coefficient of 0.2, for example,
increases average adult height by more than 7 centimeters.36

In addition,

fertile land was abundant in the United States and the American diet of
the mid l700s was probably better than that in developing countries today,

even though measured income was low in late Colonial America and is low in
developing countries today.

12

Concluding Remarks

The average height of a population is a measure of economic welfare
that is sensitive to the consumption of basic necessities, particularily

food and medical care. Consequently, height data can be used to analyze
questions traditionally posed with income data. Height studies that are
underway for various countries reveal trends and fluctuations in living

standards. Analysis of the timing and amplitude of fluctuations and
trends may help to identify causes of changes in living standards. The
distribution of height, the standard deviation of height, and differences
in average height across social and economic classes are measures of
the distribution of well-being that are useful in this area of research.
The distribution of income is an important determinant of average height.

Miong individuals height increases at a decreasing rate as a function of
income, and a more equal distribution of income at the aggregate level

increases average height. Studies of differences or changes in average
height should consider the possible effects of differences or changes in
the income distribution.

21. Income or health may have improved in some countries such that cohort
effects may become relevant for studies involving adults; per capita
income or health conditions may have been relatively lower during the

growing years for older adults in the sample. Fortunately, the tables
in the appendix usually report the age range of the study, and the

subjects in most studies could be described as young adults. The age
range in two Egyptian studies was 19—68, which is an exception.
However, the Egyptian studies and the few studies in which the age
range is not reported do not produce outliers; in each case the predicted
height is within one standard error of the estimate of the observed height.

22. The method of comparative evaluation is an issue in the use of per capita
income data for various countries. This issue is discussed in Simon
Kuznets, Modern Economic Growth: Rate, Structure, and Spread (New Haven,

16

It would be desirable to have data based on detailed

price and output comparisons, as suggested in Robert Summers, Irving B.
Kravis, and Alan Heston, "International Comparions of Real Product and
its Composition, 1950-1977," The Review of Income and Wealth 26 (March
1980), 19—66, but the number of countries for which data are available
is insufficient for the type of analysis undertaken here.

26. Attained height is a function of income during the years of height
growth, and a more elaborate model would include several lagged

values of per capita income. In view of the large differences in per
capita income across countries, lagged values would probably add little
to the analysis; their inclusion does not justify the additional complexity.

27. If all height studies, including those for only urban, rural, poor,
military, etc., are included in the analysis, the correlations are
about .15 to .30 lower. The correlations reported for age 12.. are

representative of those for adolescents of other ages. The most abundant
adolescent height data are for age 12. Per capita income is measured
as of the year that the height study was published.

"student" or "military" adolescents.
