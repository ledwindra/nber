Bounding the Effects of Social Experiments: Accounting for Attrition in Administrative Data
Jeffrey Grogger
NBER Working Paper No. 18838
February 2013
JEL No. C33,C9,I38
ABSTRACT
Social experiments frequently exploit data from administrative records. However, most administrative
data systems are state-specific, designed to track earnings or benefit payments among residents within
a single state. Once an experimental participant moves out of state, his earnings and benefits in his
state of origin consist entirely of zeros, giving rise to a form of attrition. In the presence of such attrition,
the average treatment effect of the experiment is no longer point-identified, despite random assignment.
I propose a method to estimate such attrition and, for binary outcomes such as employment, to construct
bounds on the average treatment effect. Results from a welfare-reform experiment considered to have
sizeable effects appear quite ambiguous after accounting for attrition. The results have important implications
for planning social experiments.

1. Introduction
Field experiments play an increasingly important role in economic research. Greenberg
and Schroder (2004) catalog over 250 social experiments that have been carried out since the late
1960s. Those studies cover a broad array of topics, including job training, welfare programs, and
tax compliance initiatives, among others. Examples from the US include the Gary Negative
Income Tax Experiment; the National Job Training and Partnership Act Study; the
Unemployment Insurance Bonus experiments; and numerous welfare-reform experiments
(Greenberg, Moffitt, and Friedman 1981; Bloom, et al, 1997; Meyer 1995; Grogger and Karoly
2005). A sampling of social experiments outside the US includes the Canadian Self-Sufficiency
Project; the Dutch Counseling and Monitoring Program; and job-training programs in Norway
(Michalopoulos, Tattrie, et al 2002; Gorter and Kalb 1996; Raaum and Torp 2002).
The chief virtue of social experiments stems from random assignment. By assigning
participants at random between control and treatment groups, they provide a means to estimate
the effects of experimental programs in a manner that is free of the omitted variable bias that
may arise in non-experimental designs. Experimental designs also lend themselves to simple
analytical methods that are relatively transparent and easy for non-statisticians to comprehend.
Evaluations of social experiments often make use of longitudinal administrative data.
This has been increasingly the case in recent years (Greenberg and Schroder 2004).
Administrative data come from sources such as unemployment offices and welfare agencies.
Depending on the focus of the experiment, evaluation studies may make use of administrative
data on a number of different outcomes from a number of different sources. As compared to
survey data, administrative data may be much less expensive to obtain.

1

Despite their cost advantage, administrative data suffer from an important missing data
problem. Since programs such as unemployment insurance and welfare are run at the state- or
country-level, the administrative data systems used to operate those programs only track activity
within the jurisdiction. They are not designed to capture out-of-jurisdiction migration. Thus
when a worker moves to a new jurisdiction, she will appear to have zero earnings in her
jurisdiction of origin, even if she is working in her new jurisdiction of residence. This has long
been a problem in the US, where cross-state migration is common. With increasing international
migration, the same problem may increasingly affect European register data.
Cross-jurisdiction migration means that zeros in the data arise for two reasons: because
the participant has no earnings or benefits, or because she has moved to a new jurisdiction. Since
out-of-jurisdiction migration is not directly observed, and most evaluations obtain data from a
single jurisdiction, the analyst faces a corrupted sample. Rather than observing data on the
outcomes of interest, the analyst observes a mixture of such outcomes and out-of-jurisdiction
migration, without being able to distinguish between them.
If such migration were random, then the observed data would provide a lower bound on
the effect of the program. However, if attrition arises from choices made by experimental
subjects, it may be non-random. Under non-random attrition, the observed data identify neither
the effect of the program nor a lower bound.
In this paper I consider one aspect of the out-of-jurisdiction migration problem. I analyze
permanent out-of-jurisdiction migration, which I refer to as attrition. Although this is not the
only form of migration, it is extensive. Moreover, it leaves a distinctive trail in the data. When a
study participant moves from one jurisdiction to another, all of her subsequent entries in the
administrative data systems of her jurisdiction of origin become zeros. I propose using these

2

terminal runs of zeros to impute attrition. I show how the observed data and the imputed attrition
indicator can be used to provide bounds on the average treatment effect without imposing
assumptions about the process generating the attrition.
These bounds are informative, but their width depends on the information used to impute
attrition. More information reduces imputed attrition and with it the width of the bounds. The
magnitude of the reduction can be sizeable. In the welfare experiment that I analyze below,
imputations based on multiple outcomes cut the width of the bounds by one-half to one-third as
compared to imputations based on a single outcome.
The bounds can also be narrowed by imposing additional structure. I focus on a
stationarity assumption that allows me to use non-terminal runs of zeros to estimate the share of
terminal runs that represent true attrition. A virtue of the stationary bounds is that the underlying
stationarity assumption can be tested.
The bounding strategy fits with the approach of Horowitz and Manski (1995) and
particularly Horowitz and Manski (2000), who provide bounds on experimental treatment effects
in the presence of attrition. However, there are two key differences between the setting that I
consider and that of Horowitz and Manski (2000). First, attrition in their setting means that no
outcome data are observed. That is different from my setting, where data are observed but the
analyst does not know whether they represent the outcome of interest or the consequence of outof-jurisdiction migration. Second, I assume the availability of longitudinal data, as is often the
case in social experiments, which allow bounds to be constructed on the basis of imputed
attrition.
The application reported below makes use of data from the Connecticut Jobs First (JF)
welfare-reform evaluation. The treatment condition in JF included both a substantial earnings

3

disregard, which allowed recipients to keep most of their benefit after they started working, and a
short time limit on benefit receipt. Previous analyses that did not account for the attrition
problem indicated that JF raised welfare receipt substantially before the time limit became
binding, and reduced it sharply thereafter (Bloom et al. 2002). The analysis below suggests that
there is a great deal of ambiguity in the effects of the program once one accounts for attrition.
In the next section I discuss the JF program, the data, and conventional estimates of the
average treatment effect (ATE) of the program on employment and transfer receipt. In Section 3
I show that those estimates do not identify the ATE. I discuss the attrition problem, my attrition
indicator, and the bounds based on that indicator. Section 4 discusses the bounds that can be
obtained under the assumption of stationarity and the specification tests. Empirical results from
our application accompany each section.
2. The Jobs First Program
2.1 The Experiment
JF began in 1996 with the goal of testing the effects of Connecticut’s welfare reform
program. New applicants to the welfare program were randomized between treatment and
control status at the time they applied for aid. Ongoing recipients were randomized when their
eligibility was reassessed (which typically took place every six months). The control group
received aid under the rules of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. As
compared to the control group, participants in the treatment group faced a financial work
incentive, in that they were able to retain most of their benefits when they found a job. At the
same time, the treatment group faced a short, 21-month time limit, whereas the control faced
none for four years after random assignment.

4

Economic theory predicts that the combination of a financial incentive and a time limit
should increase employment among welfare recipients. However, it predicts that the two
components of the program should have differing effects on welfare receipt. Whereas the time
limit should reduce welfare receipt, especially once it starts to bind, the financial incentive may
prolong welfare receipt, since it provides the participant with an incentive to combine work and
welfare (Grogger and Karoly 2005; Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes 2006).
There were 4803 participants included in the evaluation. Of these, 2396 were assigned to
the control group and 2407 to the treatment group. The program and its evaluation are discussed
in detail by Bloom et al. (2002).
2.2 Data
Outcome data come from two administrative data systems: Connecticut’s Unemployment
Insurance (UI) system and the state’s Eligibility Management System (EMS). The UI system
records quarterly earnings for each worker covered by the UI program. Data are reported by
employers to the state. Covered employment accounts for roughly 90 percent of all jobs
nationwide (US Bureau of Labor Statistics 1989), although it misses roughly 10 to 20 percent of
employment among welfare populations (Isaacs and Lyons 2000). Nevertheless, covered
employment is a widely used outcome in the evaluation of both welfare- and training-related
programs. By this definition, participants are employed if they have positive covered earnings
during the calendar quarter and are nonemployed if they have zero covered earnings.
EMS provides data on monthly welfare payments and Food Stamp payments for all
recipients in the state. Benefit data are available monthly, but have been aggregated to the
quarterly level so as to be comparable to the employment data. A participant is recorded as a
welfare recipient if she received a positive welfare benefit in any month during the quarter.

5

Likewise, she is recorded as a Food Stamp recipient if she received a positive Food Stamp
benefit in any month during the quarter.
3. Average Treatment Effects under Attrition
In this section I define the ATE and the conventional ATE as estimated from the
observed data. I present estimates of the conventional ATE from JF. I show that, in the presence
of attrition, such conventional estimates do not identify the true ATE.
Let Ti denote the participant’s treatment status, where Ti  1 denotes assignment to
treatment and Ti  0 denotes assignment to control. In the typical social experiment, there may
be several outcomes of interest. Attention here is restricted to binary outcomes, which are
naturally bounded. These include the outcomes I focus on from JF. Denote the K potential
outcomes for the ith participant at time t by

Yitk (Ti )  {0,1}

i=1,…,N; t=0,…,M; and k=1,…,K.

There are N participants in the experiment; the sample period extends for M periods. Period t=0
denotes the time at which random assignment takes place.
Since counterfactual outcomes are unobservable, in the absence of attrition the analyst
would observe

Yitk  TiYitk (1)  (1 Ti )Yitk (0)
Define the average treatment effects of the program at time t as  tk  EYitk (1)  EYitk (0) . This
represents the mean effect of the program among the population at risk of treatment. By virtue of
random assignment to treatment status,  tk could be identified from Yitk , since1

1

I also require the stable unit treatment value assumption, which essentially rules out general
equilibrium effects (Angrist, Imbens and Rubin 1996). Implicitly I am also assuming full
compliance with the experiment, which is appropriate for this application.
6

 tk  EYitk (1)  EYitk (0)
 E(Yitk | Ti  1)  E(Yitk | Ti  0).
This approach could easily be extended to allow for treatment effects that vary according to
observable characteristics, and such heterogeneity would often be of interest in applied settings. I
leave it implicit here in order to avoid notational clutter.
The problem for the analyst is that Yitk itself is observed only prior to the date of attrition,
which is not directly observed. Define the latent, unobserved attrition indicator as
Ait  1 if i has permanently left the jurisdiction on or before date t

 0 otherwise.
Since I define attrition as permanent migration from the jurisdiction, Ait  1  Ait  j  1 , j=1,..,
M-t. Once the participant has left the jurisdiction, I no longer observe Yitk . Rather, I observe zeros
instead. Since Yitk itself takes on zero values, the analyst does not know whether the observed
zeros represent valid realizations of Yitk or attrition.
Given the definition of Ait , I can represent the observed data as

Xitk  (1 Ait )Yitk

i=1,…,N; t=1,…,M; and k=1,…,K.

(1)

The conventional ATE reported in the literature estimates not  tk , but rather

 kXt  E(Xitk | Ti  1)  E(Xitk | Ti  0) .

(2)

Estimates of  kXt , obtained as treatment-control contrasts in the sample averages of the
outcome variables, are represented by the black lines marked with squares in Figure 1. I follow
much of the literature in reporting estimates by quarter after random assignment. The dashed

7

black lines show confidence intervals obtained as the 5th and 95th percentiles of estimates from
500 bootstrap replications.
[Figure 1 about here]
These estimates are similar to those reported by Bloom et al. (2002). They show that JF
raised employment in every quarter after random assignment by an amount ranging from roughly
4 to 7 percentage points. All of these estimates are significant in the sense that the low end of the
bootstrap confidence interval exceeds zero. The conventional treatment effect estimates for
welfare receipt are statistically significantly greater than zero during the first 7 quarters after
random assignment. They become significantly negative thereafter. This pattern stems from the
fact that time limits began to bind in quarter 8 and has been noted elsewhere in the literature
(Bloom et al 2002; Grogger and Karoly 2005; Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes 2006). The
conventional treatment effects for Food Stamp receipt are significantly positive for the first
seven quarters after random assignment and insignificantly different from zero thereafter.
However, estimates of  kXt do not identify the average treatment effects  tk .To see this,
write the conditional expectation of Yitk in terms of Ait as

E(Yitk | Ti )  P(Ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , Ait  0)  P(Ait 1| Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , Ait 1) .

(3)

Writing the conditional expectation of X itk similarly yields

E(Xitk | Ti )  P(Ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , Ait  0)  P(Ait  1| Ti )E(1 Ait | Ti , Ait  1)
 P(Ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , Ait  0)

(4)

 E(Yitk | Ti )
where the last line follows since both P( Ait  1 | Ti ) and E (Yitk | Ti , Ait  1) are bounded between
zero and one. This implies that

 kXt  P(Ait  0 | Ti  1)E(Yitk | Ti  1, Ait  0)  P(Ait  0 | Ti  0)E(Yitk | Ti  0, Ait  0), (5)
8

which does not identify  tk .  kXt would provide a lower bound for  tk (in an absolute value
sense) if attrition were independent of treatment status, since in that case P(Ait | Ti )  P(Ait ) .
However, if attrition is affected by treatment, then  kXt cannot be used to point-identify  tk .
Estimates of  kXt can be used to provide bounds on  tk that are valid for general departures from
random attrition.2
4. Bounds based on imputed attrition
4.1 Hypothetical bounds based on Ait
To motivate my approach, it is instructive to consider how one might construct bounds if
Ait were observable. Define

Zitk  (1 Ait )Yitk  Ait

i=1,…,N; t=1,…,M; and k=1,…,K. Then

E(Zitk | Ti )  P(Ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , Ait  0)  P(Ait  1 | Ti )E(Ait | Ti , Ait  1)
 P(Ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , Ait  0)  P(Ait  1 | Ti )

(6)

 E(Yitk | Ti ),
where the final inequality follows since

E ( Z itk | Ti )  E (Yitk | Ti )  P( Ait  1 | Ti )[1  E (Yitk | Ti , Ait  1)]
and P( Ait  1 | Ti ) and E (Yitk | Ti , Ait  1) are bounded between zero and one. Combining (4) and
(6) yields
E ( X itk | Ti )  E (Yitk | Ti )  E ( Z itk | Ti ) ,
from which it follows that

E(Xitk | Ti  1)  E(Zitk | Ti  0)   tk  E(Zitk | Ti  1)  E(Xitk | Ti  0),

(7)

When  tk varies as a function of covariates, the bounds are valid for the average treatment
effect within the population at risk of treatment for given values of the covariates.
2

9

or equivalently,

 kXt  P(Ait 1| Ti  0)   tk   kXt  P(Ait  1 | Ti  1) .

(8)

Equation (8) shows that the width of the bound is P ( Ait  1 | Ti  1)  P( Ait  1 | Ti  0) .
The approach yields bounds because X itk and Z itk complement one another. Whereas
X itk effectively replaces post-attrition values of Yitk with zeros, Z itk replaces them with ones. Of
course, the approach is not feasible empirically because the attrition indicator Ait is not
observed. In the next section I introduce imputed attrition indicators based on observable data
and show that they can be used in a similar way to construct bounds for  tk .
4.2. Imputing attrition

The imputed attrition indicators are quite intuitive. Since attrition implies that X itk  0
for all periods following the date of departure, runs of zeros at the end of the sample period are
suggestive of attrition. I use these terminal runs of zeros to impute attrition.
Although our primary interest is in terminal runs of zeros, it is useful for discussing the
stationary bounds below to adopt notation for runs of arbitrary initial duration d. Such runs can
be defined for any of the K observable outcome sequences. Define binary indicators of d-period
runs of zeros for the kth outcome beginning at date t as

 d1

k

aitk (d)  I  Xit

0
j
 j0

where I(A)=1 if the event A is true and I(A)=0 otherwise. Thus aitk ( d )  1 if X itk  j  0 for
j=0,…,d-1. Data from all K outcome sequences can be pooled by defining

10

 K

ait ( d )  I   aitk ( d )  K  .
 k 1

The terminal runs of zeros that I use to impute attrition are indicated by aitk ( M  t  1)
for single outcomes and ait ( M  t  1) for multiple outcomes. For ease of notation, I define
aitk  aitk ( M  t  1) and ait  ait ( M  t  1) . I focus attention on the multiple-outcome indicator
ait for the rest of the theoretical development, although the same analysis could be carried out in

terms of the single-outcome indicators aitk .
4.3. Bounds based on imputed attrition

The observed data X itk , which are defined in terms of the latent attrition indicator Ait ,
can be defined equivalently in terms of the imputed attrition indicator ait . To see this, let

xitk  (1 ait )Yitk

i=1,…,N; t=1,…,M; and k=1,…,K.

(9)

Equations (1) and (9) imply that X itk  xitk whenever Ait  ait . Ait  ait implies that Ait  0 and
k
ait  1 , since Ait  1  ait  1 . This arises when Xit
j  0 , for k = 1,…,K and j=0,…, M-t-1, even

though the participant has not yet left the jurisdiction. In this case, Xitk  0 and xitk  0 (since

ait  1), so the two sequences are equivalent. Thus xitk identifies  kXt .
Proceeding along the lines of section 4.1, define

zitk  (1 ait )Yitk  ait

i=1,…,N; t=1,…,M; and k=1,…,K.

(10)

Evaluating the expectations of (9) and (10) yields

E(xitk | Ti )  P(ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , ait  0)  P(ait  1| Ti )E(1 ait | Ti , ait  1)
 P(ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , ait  0)

11

(11)

and

E(zitk | Ti )  P(ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , ait  0)  P(ait  1| Ti )E(ait | Ti , ait  1)
 P(ait  0 | Ti )E(Yitk | Ti , ait  0)  P(ait  1| Ti ).

(12)

Writing the conditional expectation of Yitk along the lines of (2), but in terms of ait rather than
Ait , yields

E (Yitk | Ti )  P( ait  0 | Ti ) E (Yitk | Ti , ait  0)  P( ait  1 | Ti ) E (Yitk | Ti , ait  1) .

(13)

Comparing (11) and (12) to (13) yields
E ( xitk | Ti )  E (Yitk | Ti )  E ( z itk | Ti ) ,
from which it follows that

E(xitk | Ti  1)  E(zitk | Ti  0)   tk  E(zitk | Ti 1)  E(xitk | Ti  0),

(14)

or equivalently,

 kXt  P(ait  1| Ti  0)   tk   kXt  P(ait 1| Ti  1) .

(15)

The width of the bound is P (ait  1 | Ti  1)  P (ait  1 | Ti  0) . This is wider than the
hypothetical bounds above, since Ait  1  ait  1 . As a general rule, one would expect the
width of the bound to depend on the amount and nature of the information used to impute
attrition. The next section illustrates.
4.3 Terminal Runs of Zeros and Estimated Bounds on  tk

Table 1 displays the sample distribution of terminal runs of zeros by the quarter in which
the run begins. The first three pairs of columns report tabulations based on terminal runs of zeros
in each of the separate outcome sequences. These represent tabulations of aitk .
[Table 1 about here]

12

Within each pair of columns, the first column reports the entry hazard for a terminal run,
that is, the probability that a terminal run begins at time t, given that it had not yet begun at time
t-1. The entry hazard for terminal runs based on single outcome sequences can be written as
k
P[aitk  1| ai,t1
(1)  0)]. The second column reports the probability of imputed attrition, which can

be written in terms of the entry hazards as
t 1

P(aitk

 1) 

 P[aitk  j  1 | aik,t  j 1 (1)  0)] .

(16)

j 0

Thus the first entry in the first column shows that 17.2 percent of the sample began a
terminal run of zero employment in the first quarter after random assignment. By definition of a
terminal run, these runs were fifteen quarters long. In the second quarter, the probability that a
14-quarter run of zero employment began was 0.6 percent, so the cumulative probability of
attrition in quarter 2 was 17.8 percent.
Since the probability of imputed attrition is defined as the cumulative probability of
terminal runs of zeros, it grows over the sample period. Based on the employment data alone,
attrition is imputed to 42.7 percent of the sample by the end of the sample period. Imputed
attrition is even higher based on the other outcomes. Imputed attrition amounts to 75 percent of
the sample based on the welfare receipt indicator and 57.3 percent based on the Food Stamp
receipt indicator.
Terminal runs of zeros based on all three outcome series, corresponding to ait , appear in
the final pair of columns. Combining the three data series to impute attrition has a dramatic
effect on the distribution of terminal runs of zeros. Based on all three outcomes, only 1 percent
of the sample began a terminal run of zeros in the first quarter of the sample period, as compared

13

to 17 percent based on the employment outcome alone. Based on the multiple-outcome attrition
indicator, only 20.8 percent of the sample appears to leave by the end of the sample period.
Combining data series to impute attrition can greatly reduce the amount of attrition that
appears in the sample. Although this reduction is particularly large due to the negative
correlation among our outcomes, multiple-outcome attrition indicators will yield lower levels of
imputed attrition than their single-outcome counterparts provided that the underlying outcomes
are not perfectly correlated. This is important, because the analysis above suggests that the width
of our bounds will be roughly twice the probability of imputed attrition. It has implications for
the design of social experiments, as I elaborate in Section 6.
Figure 1 presents estimated bounds based on equation (15), which are constructed from
the multiple-outcome attrition indicator ait . These are depicted as solid gray lines with circular
plotting symbols near the top and bottom of each graph. Confidence intervals appear as dashed
gray lines. These are based on bootstrapped standard errors derived from 200 bootstrap samples,
for which individuals were sampled with replacement.
Consider first the employment results in the top figure. According to the conventional
treatment effects, JF raised employment in every quarter after random assignment by an amount
ranging from roughly 4 to 7 percentage points. However, the bounds show that there is
considerable ambiguity associated with these results. Between quarters 5 and 6, the half-width of
the bound becomes greater than the estimate of  kXt . By (15), this implies that the bound covers
zero, so the sign of  tk is ambiguous. Factoring in sampling variation, the lower bounds are
statistically significant in only the first four quarters. Nevertheless, ambiguity owing to attrition
is a much larger problem than uncertainty owing to sampling variation. Ignoring attrition makes
the data appear much more informative than they truly are.

14

Turning to the estimates for welfare receipt in the middle figure, the conventional
treatment effects were significantly greater than zero during the first 7 quarters after random
assignment and then became significantly negative, as discussed above. At the same time,
attrition gives rise to considerable ambiguity. The lower bound exceeds zero during the first 7
quarters, but the upper bound is never less than zero in the latter part of the sample period.
Strictly speaking, there is ambiguity owing to attrition as to whether the effect of JF on welfare
receipt became negative once the time limit became binding.
The bottom figure depicts the effects of JF on Food Stamp receipt. The conventional
treatment effects are significantly positive for the first seven quarters after random assignment
and insignificantly different from zero thereafter. However, the lower bound is never
significantly greater than zero.
5. Stationary Bounds

One can tighten the bounds, and reduce the ambiguity in the estimates, by relaxing the
implicit assumption that all terminal runs are equally likely to reflect attrition. Whereas the long
terminal runs that begin early in the sample period seem consistent with out-of-jurisdiction
migration as discussed in Section 1, the short terminal runs beginning late in the sample period
may just as well stem from fluctuations in Yitk . This may be a particular problem in light of the
fluctuations in employment and transfer receipt that are typical of welfare recipients (Bane and
Ellwood 1994; Isaacs and Lyon 2000).
Table 2 helps to illustrate this problem. Column (1) shows simply that the length of the
terminal run is perfectly negatively correlated with the time that it begins. Columns (2) and (3)
report the hazard and probability of a terminal run of zeros by quarter after random assignment,

15

taken from columns (7) and (8) of Table 1. The hazard rises toward the end of the sample period,
which could be an artifact of the fixed end of the sample period.
[Table 2 about here]

To account for this artifact, I use data from the entire sample period to estimate the share
of runs of a given initial duration that eventually become terminal runs. I then use this estimate to
adjust the estimated attrition probability. For example, to adjust the hazard in quarter 15, when
all new runs are one quarter long and are necessarily terminal, I estimate from the full data set
the share of all one-quarter runs that eventually become terminal. The estimate is 42.7 percent. I
use this number to adjust the hazard and the cumulative probability of attrition at quarter 15.
This approach comes at the cost of assuming a particular form of stationarity. As I
illustrate below, I require the conditional probability of attrition, given an initial duration of
length d, to be the same throughout the sample period. Fortunately, a partial test for this
assumption can be constructed from the data.
5.1 Adjusting the Attrition Hazards

The question is whether attrition at time t can be predicted from a run of length d that
begins at time t. The attrition hazard at t can be written as

P[Ait 1| ai,t1 (1)  0)]  P[Ait 1| ait (d) 1, ai,t1 (1)  0)]P[ait (d)  1 | ai,t1 (1)  0)]

(17)

for t=1,...,M-d+1. The left side of (17) is the probability that attrition takes place at t, since

ai,t1 (1)  0 implies that attrition could not have taken place prior to t. The right side expresses
this as the product of two terms. The first is the probability that attrition takes place at t, given
that a run of length d (at least) begins at t. The second is the probability that a run of length d (at

16

least) begins at t. The first term can be thought of as an adjustment factor that adjusts for the
probability that a run of length at least d actually reflects attrition.
The key stationarity assumption is that the first term in constant in t, that is, that a run of
at least d periods be equally likely to predict attrition for all values of t. This requires the
relationship between true zeros and attrition to be the same for all t.
To estimate the key adjustment factor, one must replace the unobservable Ait with the
observable ait . In principle, a separate estimate of the adjustment factor could be obtained from
the sample counterpart of P[ait  1 | ait ( d )  1, ai , t 1 (1)  0] for each value of t=1, ..., M-d. In
practice, one would expect lower values of t to yield lower estimates, since they make use of
longer follow-up periods. Whereas estimates based on runs beginning at t=1 make use of M-d
follow-up periods of data, estimates based on runs beginning at t=M-d make use of a single
follow-up period. I return to this issue below when I discuss stationarity tests.
Column (4) of Table 2 reports estimates of P[ait  1 | ait ( d )  1, ai , t 1 (1)  0] . For each
value of d, they average over all runs beginning between t=1 and t=M-d. Not surprisingly, these
adjustment factors rise in d. All 15-period runs must begin in quarter 1, so the adjustment factor
equals 1. Runs of at least 14 periods can begin in either quarter 1 or quarter 2. The entry of 1 in
the second row of column (4) tells us that all runs of length at least 14 were in fact terminal runs,
regardless of when they began.
Shorter runs are much less predictive of attrition. As mentioned above, among all singleperiod runs in the data, only 42.7 percent were terminal, as shown in the last row of column (4).
About three quarters of all four-period runs were terminal.

17

Column (5) of Table 2 reports estimates of the product on the right side of (17). This is
simply the product of the numbers in columns (2) and (4). This adjusted hazard rises much less
strongly over time than its unadjusted counterpart. This suggests that much of the increase in the
unadjusted hazard was not due to an increase in the attrition hazard over time, but due to the fact
that a run is more likely to be terminal, the closer it begins to the end of the sample period.
The adjusted probability of imputed attrition, defined as the cumulative sum of the
adjusted attrition hazards, is reported in column (6). Early in the sample period, it differs little
from the unadjusted probability displayed in column (3). As time from random assignment
increases, the two probabilities become more different. By the end of the sample period, the
adjusted probability of imputed attrition is just over three-fourths of the unadjusted probability.
Stationary bounds based on the adjusted probability of imputed attrition are displayed in
Figure 2 as solid gray lines. For comparison purposes, the general bounds from Figure 1 appear
as solid black lines. I have omitted confidence intervals to avoid clutter. The stationary bounds
are somewhat narrower than the general bounds, particularly toward the end of the sample
period.

5.2 Testing for Stationarity

The stationarity tests take advantage of the multiplicity of estimates for the adjustment
factor P[ait  1 | ait ( d )  1, ai , t 1 (1)  0] . In principle, one could test whether
P[ait  1 | ait (d )  1, ai ,t 1 (1)  0]  P[ai,t  j  1 | ai ,t  j (d )  1, ai,t  j 1 (1)  0]

18

(18)

for j=1,...M-d. In practice, there may be reasons to adjust this procedure. As discussed above,
empirical estimates of P[ait  1 | ait ( d )  1, ai , t 1 (1)  0] may differ by t not only because of
non-stationarity, but also because runs that begin later in the sample period are more likely to be
terminal runs simply because they involve fewer follow-up periods. To deal with this problem, I
fix the follow-up period at a particular value s, and base our test on
P[ait (d  s )  1 | ait (d )  1, ai ,t 1 (1)  0]  P[ai ,t  j (d  s )  1 | ai ,t  j (d )  1, ai ,t  j 1 (1)  0]

(19)

for j=1,...,M-d-s. This limits the number of tests that can be conducted, particularly of those
involving runs that begin close to the end of the sample period. Panel A of Table 3 presents
estimated values of P[ait  1 | ait (d )  1, ai,t 1 (1)  0] from (18) for odd values of d ranging from
1 to 13 by quarter after random assignment. The other three panels of the Table present estimated
values of P[ait (d  s )  1 | ait (d )  1, ai,t 1 (1)  0] from (19) for the same values of d and the

arbitrarily chosen values of s=3, 5, and 7.
[Table 3 about here]
Results in panel A show clear pattern: for fixed initial duration d, the conditional
probability of terminal runs is generally higher at the end of the sample period than at the
beginning. Particularly consistent are the high conditional probabilities at time t=15-d. Fstatistics for tests of stationarity of the conditional attrition probabilities are shown at the bottom
of each column. These have been calculated so as to account for the presence of multiple
observations from each participant. Also shown are p-values for the F-tests that have not been
corrected for multiple comparisons. For an overall test of size 0.05, a Bonferroni correction
would lead one to reject the null if any of the unadjusted p-values was greater than
0.05/7=0.0071. The null of stationarity is clearly rejected by the estimates in panel A.

19

As discussed above, the rejection could arise either from true non-stationarity in the
conditional attrition probabilities or from variation in the length of the follow-up period. The
pattern in Panel A is consistent with the latter interpretation, since one would expect estimated
conditional probabilities to be higher, the shorter the follow-up period used to estimate them.
Panels B through D present estimates based on fixed follow-up periods for all values of t and d.
Not surprisingly, the conditional attrition probabilities estimated from fixed follow-up
periods are higher than their counterparts in panel A, which utilize all available follow-up data.
Shorter follow-ups increase the appearance of attrition. This is evident in moving from Panel B,
with the shortest follow-up period and the highest conditional probabilities, to Panel D, with the
longest fixed follow-up period and the lowest conditional probabilities.
Fixing the follow-up period also reduces the extent to which the estimated conditional
probabilities rise with t, holding d (and s) constant. Indeed, for short initial runs of 1 to 3 periods,
the estimated conditional attrition probabilities are lower toward the end of the sample period
than at the beginning.
The significance levels of the F-tests for stationarity fall as well. Nevertheless, the tests
still reject the null at the 5 percent level in the case of panels B and C, applying Bonferroni
corrections. In both cases, the rejections come in the case of the shortest initial runs, where d=1.
Only in the case of the longest follow-up period (panel D) does the stationarity test fail to reject.
On the one hand, one might wish to weight the evidence from the longest follow-up the most,
since longer fixed follow-ups correspond more closely to the notion of attrition as described in
Section 1. On the other hand, the longest follow-ups do not allow for stationarity tests toward the
end of the sample period, where the gain in terms of tightening the bounds is greatest.

20

More generally, how one weighs mixed evidence from the stationarity tests should be
based on some notion of the loss function attached to tighter bounds on  tk . If the tighter
stationary bounds resolved fundamental ambiguities stemming from the width of the general
bounds, stringent rejection criteria for the stationarity tests might be viewed as appropriately
cautious. With less at stake, the distinction might be less important.
6. Discussion

Attrition due to out-of-jurisdiction migration poses an important problem for evaluating
social experiments. Many such evaluations make use of administrative data. Administrative
sources provide longitudinal data that are free of survey response errors and are generally
cheaper to obtain than survey data. However, most administrative files cover residents of a single
jurisdiction, and most evaluations avail themselves only of data from the jurisdiction in which
the experiment is conducted. When a participant leaves the jurisdiction, the entries in her
administrative records become made up of zeros. Since zeros are valid values in many cases, and
migration is not directly observed, this means the analyst must deal with corrupted data.
Conventional estimates based on corrupted data do not identify the average treatment effect.
I propose using terminal runs of zeros to impute attrition and using the imputed attrition
indicators to estimate bounds for average treatment effects. The amount of information used to
impute attrition plays a key role in determining the width of the bounds. In the empirical
example, bounds based on individual outcomes, such as employment or welfare receipt, are too
wide to be very meaningful. Bounds based on all available outcomes lead to dramatic reductions
in imputed attrition and hence in the width of the bounds. Negative correlation among the
outcomes is particularly helpful, but adding any imperfectly correlated outcomes should help
produce tighter bounds.

21

This finding has important implications for the design of experimental evaluations based
on administrative data. It indicates that one should collect as much data as possible to reduce the
width of the bounds. This is particularly important for experiments that focus primarily on a
single outcome, such as employment. Even if other outcomes are of no direct interest given the
objectives of the experiments, they may be invaluable for reducing the ambiguity that arises due
to attrition. Data from unconventional sources such as school or Department of Motor Vehicle
records may provide valuable additional information, as would data from nearby jurisdictions.
Data from other time periods or locations within the state might also be used.
In terms of the experiment I analyze, attrition leads to considerable ambiguity regarding
its effects. Conventional analyses that did not account for attrition showed the Jobs First welfare
reform program to have strong and significant positive effects on employment. However, by the
sixth quarter after random assignment, the half-width of the estimated bounds exceeded the
magnitude of the conventional ATE.
To tighten the bounds I propose an approach which is valid under a particular stationarity
assumption. The stationary bounds were somewhat smaller than the general bounds in the case of
the JF program, especially toward the end of the sample period. I also provide tests for the
stationarity assumption.
Considerable resources are expended on social experiments, often with the belief that
such experiments provide the strongest possible evidence regarding the effects of social
programs. Due to attrition, however, results from experimental evaluations may involve much
more ambiguity than has previously been recognized. More extensive data collection can help to
reduce that ambiguity.
