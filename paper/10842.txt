The Measurement and Evolution of Health Inequality: Evidence from the U.S. Medicare Population

ABSTRACT
Has U.S. health care for the elderly become more equitable during the past several decades? When
inequality is measured by Medicare expenditures, the answer is yes. During 1987-2001, low income
households experienced an increase of 78 percent ($2624) in per capita expenditures, double the
increase of 34 percent ($1214) in the highest income group. When inequality is measured by life
expectancy, the answer is no. Survival for the lowest income decile grew by 0.2 years during the
1990s compared to 0.8 years in the highest income group. That the two measures deliver such
discordant messages may reflect their intrinsic shortcomings; expenditures depend on preferences,
health status, and prices, while outcomes are strongly affected by health behavior and past illness.
We suggest a new approach to measuring inequality: the use of quality-based effective care
measures. For these measures, efficacy is well proven and nearly all of the relevant population
should be receiving it, regardless of health status or preferences. Using Medicare claims data
matched to zip code income, we find greater use of mammography screening, diabetic eye exams,
and the use of ââ blockers and reperfusion following heart attacks among higher income households,
and these differences appear to be stable or growing slowly over time. In sum, the rapid relative
growth in health care expenditures among low income elderly people has not translated into relative
improvement either in survival or rates of effective care.

The technological revolution in health care has brought both great benefits with
respect to survival and general well-being, and substantial increases in costs.1 Whether
these changes have reduced inequality in health care or in health outcomes is not well
understood. Earlier research suggested that medical care innovations, such as the use of
antibiotics in the treatment of tuberculosis, reduced health care disparities by race
(McDermott, 1978). On the other hand, studies of health care expenditures by income
group found higher income groups accounting for a larger fraction of spending,
particularly after accounting for health status.2 Recent studies also suggest that better
educated patients get access to newer drugs (Lleras-Muney and Lichtenberg, 2002),
survive longer following the diagnosis of cancer (Glied and Lleras-Muney, 2003) and
comply better with regimens for the treatment of AIDS (Goldman and Smith, 2002).
This paper returns to the question of whether technological advances and
increases in health care expenditures have been associated with a widening or a
narrowing of inequality in health or in health care. The group studied is the over-65
population in the United States during the 1990s, which is of interest given their high
rates of utilization and very high rates of insurance coverage under the Medicare
program. Initially, two conventional measures of inequality are considered: health care
expenditures and health care outcomes as measured by 10-year survival rates. Using

For the older literature, see LeGrand (1978, 1982), Le Grand et. al. (1991), Wagstaff et. al.,
(1991), Davis and Reynolds (1975), Link, Long, and Settle (1982). More recently see McClellan
and Skinner (2004), although see Kapur et. al. (2004), and Battacharya and Lakdawalla (2004).
Chen and Escarce (2004) find a pronounced negative association between income and
expenditures, but reverses the association after controlling for a host of covariates measuring
wellbeing and disease burden. Other studies find quite nuanced patterns, for example Gittelsohn,
Halpern, and Sanchez (1991) and Morris, Sutton, and Gravelle (2003).

detailed Medicare claims data on a panel of several million people in the over-65
population in the United States back to 1987, we matched individuals to income deciles
based on median income in their zip code of residence. Between 1987 and 2001, we
found a dramatic increase in health care expenditures among the lowest income groups,
accounting for a 78 percent increase ($2624) in real terms compared to a 34 percent
increase ($1214) for those in the top income decile. Using expenditures as a marker for
health inequality, one would conclude that inequality has lessened, and if anything the
higher (annual) expenditures for lower income households would help to compensate for
earlier years during which insurance coverage and preventive care was minimal.3
There are a variety of disadvantages to using expenditures for health care as a
measure of access, however. Expenditures may reflect patient preferences, health status,
and access to care, nor is it clear how expenditures on health care translate into health
outcomes (e.g., Fisher et. al., 2003a,b). For example, much of the differential increase in
expenditures by income group during this period was accounted for by home health care,
a program where 40 cents of every dollar in spending was deemed inappropriate by one
government investigation (Havemann, 1997).
A different picture emerges in the evolution of outcomes as measured by 10-year
survival rates. While each income group experienced a survival gain during the 1990s,
those in higher income groups did better: life expectancy rose by 0.2 years in the bottom
income decile compares to 0.8 years in the top income decile. But this measure is not
immune from criticism either. Individual decisions regarding healthy behavior exert an
important influence on health outcomes over the life-course, and it is rarely clear whether
these choices should be attributed to “preferences,” education, or economic status per se

(Graham, 2002; Contoyannis and Jones, 2004; Smith, 2003). As well, long and variable
lags in outcomes make it difficult to evaluate the impact of the current health care
expenditures on changes in current health outcomes, particularly when income itself is
endogenous to health status (Case and Deaton, 2003).
That the two measures of health inequality are contradictory suggest the need for
a different approach. We propose focusing on a more limited set of effective (or highquality) utilization measures with well-established benefits.4 These measures include
mammography screening among women age 65-69, eye examinations for diabetics, and
smoking cessation advice, aspirin, -blockers, and reperfusion in the first 12 hours
following the heart attack. These latter three treatments accounted for the vast majority
of improvement in 30-day survival following heart attacks (Heidenreich and McClellan,
2001). The advantage of these measures over expenditures is that one need not control
for health status; nearly everyone in the appropriate universe should be receiving these
treatments. Nor does one need to control for preferences towards health care, or for
lifestyle differences; every appropriate heart attack patient should be receiving Blockers upon admission, regardless of whether they are marathon runners or couch
potatoes.5 The use of these measures are not dependent on genetic or environmental
factors that might further confound differences in survival rates across income groups.
As well, there is increasing effort to collect these measures as components of health care
quality indices, for example by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)
at the hospital level or by Jencks (2003) at the state level.
4

This terminology follows that in Wennberg et. al. (2002).

5

In some cases, preferences can still play a role in screening programs, see Walter et. al. (2004).
The question is then raised as to whether those preferences against effective care reflect past
adverse encounters with the health care system.

3

Using the Medicare claims data augmented with the Cooperative Cardiovascular
Project (CCP) data for heart attack patients in 1994/95, we find distinct income gradients
with regard to the use of effective care. For mammography, examination rates for the top
income decile were 16 percentage points higher than the lowest decile in 1993, and by
2001 the gap had shrunk only slightly to 15 percentage points. For the inpatient
treatment of heart attacks in 1994/95, where the use of effective care is unlikely to have
any incremental impact on patient costs and where noncompliance is minimal, the
income gradients are smaller; 7 percentage points for

blockers and 5 percentage points

for reperfusion therapy within 12 hours, with no significant differences in aspirin or ACE
inhibitor use.6
In sum, the dramatic increases in relative Medicare expenditures for low income
neighborhoods during the past several decades have not translated into similar
improvements in health outcomes. The apparent lack of relative improvement in
effective care among the lowest income groups makes this puzzle less surprising, but by
itself cannot explain the widening of survival trends by income group.7 Still, the use of
effective care measures can allow the government to work towards actually doing
something about inequality in health care. Monitoring and rewarding providers and
patients to raise rates near the 100 percent ideal for all Medicare enrollees would have the
additional salutary effect of erasing inequality in the dimension of effective care.
6

Reperfusion therapy (12-hour surgical angioplasty or “clot busting” thrombolytics) is effective
at removing the blockage or clots restricting blood flow to the heart. Aspirin is effective at
breaking down platelets that are essential components of these clots interfering with blood flow.
ACE inhibitors attenuate the body’s natural tendency to constrict vascular walls, while blockers
reduce the body’s demands on the heart.

Medicare expenditures and effective care measures at the regional level.

1. The Measurement of Health and Health Care Inequality
It is important to distinguish between inequality in health care and inequality in
health. There is a long history of measuring inequality in health care by the use of
utilization or expenditures measures. Le Grand (1978, 1982) and others found a positive
gradient between expenditures and income after controlling for measures of health status
in the United Kingdom, even after several decades of National Health Insurance. While
there was a lively debate about how best to measure income-based gradients in health
care ( Wagstaff et. al., 1991, Le Grand, 1991), the positive association between
expenditures and income has been found in many countries with just a few exceptions
(Wagstaff et. al., 1991). The earlier evidence from the United States pointed towards the
same positive association between expenditures and income (Davis and Reynolds, 1975;
Link, Long, and Settle, 1982), although more recent data on Medicare expenditures in the
1990s suggests that lower income households have began to account for higher levels of
spending (Lee, McClellan, and Skinner, 1999; McClellan and Skinner, 2004.
Health care expenditures have been used to construct measures of “full income”
that include both money income and government-financed health care expenditures. This
approach was pioneered by Eugene Smolensky and his colleagues at Wisconsin during
the 1970s in the study of income distribution (Reynolds and Smolensky, 1977; Moon,
1977), and extended to valuing health care benefits in a money-metric context
(Smolensky, et. al., 1977). More recently, Fuchs (1998a, 2001) has used this approach to
document the very large fraction of full income among the elderly in the U.S. comprised
of health care expenditures, most of which is paid for by younger generations. The
implicit message in creating full income measures is the opportunity cost of health care

5

spending, that a reduction in health care spending could have a large impact on money
income, particularly among low income groups.
The interest in illness-adjusted expenditures or utilization can be motivated by a
concern about access to care, where the null hypothesis of perfect equality is presumably
one where high income and low income individuals with similar medical ailments would
be treated with the same procedures and with the same degree of intensity. But some
have questioned whether equal rates of utilization are really the same as equal access, for
example if people with high incomes experienced different preferences for care (Mooney
et. al., 1991, Culyer et. al., 1992). While economists are generally comfortable taking
preferences as given, the issue is less clear in the health care literature. For example,
Ibrahim, et. al. (2001, 2002) documented more distrust of surgery among black
candidates for hip or knee replacement, and placed greater reliance on alternative (nonsurgical) approaches such as copper bracelets or prayer. Katz (2001) has distinguished
between preferences “guided by informed decisions” and those “limited by truncated
opportunities or historical circumstances.” Thus if low income households are less likely
to seek care because of past adverse encounters with the health care system, their choices
today may be related less to immutable preferences and more to past financial or cultural
barriers in access to care.
Another shortcoming of using health expenditures is that higher levels of
expenditures may not translate into better health outcomes. Glover (1938) counseled
against the overuse of tonsillectomies at a time when the risk of surgical complications
was high. He and his colleagues noted that children of anxious high-income parents were
more likely to receive the procedure and hence more likely exposed to the risk of

6

operative mortality. More generally, Fisher et. al. (2003a, b) has suggested that regions
with greater use of health care were no more likely to experience better outcomes or even
improved satisfaction of patients and access to care. In other words, higher expenditures
do not always translate into better health.
In the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in the inequality of health,
whether measured as lifespan, quality-adjusted life years, healthy life years, or selfreported health.8 Measuring health outcomes avoids the problem of inferring the
effectiveness of health care expenditures on outcomes. It also has the advantage of
capturing income-based differences in a variety of factors such as health behavior, diet,
and life-course events that have a larger impact on health outcomes than the health care
system alone. The results are if anything quite a bit stronger, exhibiting a uniform and
consistent gradient between income and health care outcomes.
Inequality in health outcomes can be present even in the absence of inequality in
health care. Suppose that the health care system were perfectly equal, and provided
instant access to all people in society. Inequality in outcomes could still occur for a
variety of reasons. The first is simply luck or genetic differences across the population
(Gakidou, Murray, and Frenk, 2000). However, most summary measures of incomebased health inequality remove this source of inequality by averaging over large numbers
of individuals. For example the “concentration index” compares the cumulative
distribution of income on the horizontal axis, and the cumulative distribution of healthy

and van Doorslaer, 2004.

life years (however measured) on the vertical axis, thereby averaging out variation
occurring within income categories.9
The second source of lifespan inequality arises from potential differences in
health behavior such as diet, smoking, exercise, drinking, and other factors associated
with income and socioeconomic status, so that “... inequalities in health reflect the wider
inequalities in society.” (Le Grand, 1982, p. 45.) For example, Contoyannis and Jones
(2004) report that these measures of “healthy living” in 1984 were strong predictors of
positive good health in 1991. Of course, this raises the very difficult question again of
how one can separate “preferences” for health-related behavior from income per se.
These health behaviors or health shocks can have long-lasting effects, for example see
Almond’s (2003) study of the long-term negative repercussions of being in utero during
the 1918 influenza epidemic. As well, these long-term health shocks can affect both
earnings capacity and health, muddying the causal link between income and health
outcomes even further (Case and Deaton, 2003; Elstad and Krokstad, 2003; Graham,
2002).
We suggest a more restrictive but theoretically cleaner measure of health care
inequality: to measure utilization rates of effective care, procedures that are efficacious
for every appropriate patient. Examples include mammography screening for women
aged 65-69, and

blocker, aspirin, reperfusion therapies, and ACE inhibitor use for heart

attack patients.10 Mammography has been adopted as a measure of preventive care in

9

The measure of inequality is then calculated much like the Gini coefficient; for a general
discussion of health inequality decompositions, see Contoyannis and Forster (1999).
10

Reperfusion therapy (12-hour angioplasty or “clot busting” thrombolytics) is effective at
removing the blockage or clots restricting blood flow to the heart. Aspirin is effective at breaking
down platelets that are essential components of these clots interfering with blood flow. ACE

other studies as well, for example see Decker (2004) and Card, Dobkin, and Maestas
(2004).
There are several advantages in using such measures. The first is the existence of
a reliable link between utilization and health outcomes. Second, there is no need to
control (however imperfectly) for health status, since among appropriate or ideal patients,
nearly everyone should receive the treatment. Finally, preferences should generally not
play a strong role in the use of such interventions, given that the objective benefits are so
much larger than the costs.11 Trends or levels in several of these effective care measures
will be considered further below, after first examining the empirical record on the
evolution of health care expenditures and survival by income group.
2. The Distribution of Medicare Expenditures by Zip Code Income
The Continuous Medicare History Survey (CMHS), a 5 percent sample of every
Medicare enrollee, is used to consider the secular trends of overall Medicare expenditures
by income decile. Because individual income is not available in the Medicare claims
data, we instead use median zip code income from the 1990 U.S. Census, assigned to
each individual in the Medicare denominator file based on their mailing address zip code.
(The results are not sensitive to the use of the 2000 Census income data.) There are
advantages and disadvantages of using zip code income from the Census instead of
individual income data from surveys. On the one hand, the neighborhood that a person

inhibitors attenuate the body’s natural tendency to constrict vascular walls, while blockers
reduce the body’s demands on the heart.
11

In practice, Walter et. al. (2004) has pointed out that preferences could play a legitimate role
for some patients who may not want to be screened. These arguments are harder to make in the
case of heart attack treatments; it seems unlikely that anyone should prefer not to take aspirin
following a heart attack. Alternatively, one may view the benefits as being sufficiently high to
justify paternalistic efforts on the part of the government to encourage such practices.

9

lives in may better reflect permanent income than self-reported income, which may be
infested with measurement error and transitory income, and particularly for the elderly
population not reflect important components of household wealth. On the other hand, zip
code income is subject to “ecological bias,” poor Medicare enrollees in rich
neighborhoods could be treated differently from rich enrollees in poor neighborhoods.
One previous study, however, has suggested that zip code income provides a reasonable
characterization in health-related research (Geronimus, et. al., 1996).
In quantifying health care expenditures for the over 65 population, we express all
expenditures in 2001 dollars, and estimate age-sex-specific expenditures in 5-year age
increments (plus those 85+) for each of 10 income deciles. In aggregated data, we use
direct adjustment to normalize the per capital Medicare expenditures to a constant age
and sex composition over time by use of the sample frequencies of the 10 age-sex
categories.12 Only fee-for-service Medicare enrollees are included in the sample, which
means that expenditures made on behalf of enrollees in Medicare managed care will not
be included in this sample.13 The sample size is sufficiently large (30.8 million personyears) that standard errors are small, and so are not reported.
Table 1 and Figure 1 present expenditures for selected income deciles in 19872001. Not surprisingly, real Medicare expenditures have increased during this period.
12

Thus the age-sex frequencies are averages over 1987-2001. Just the 80+ population is
considered in quantifying home health care, and so for this group there are four age-sex
categories, males 80-84, males 85+, females 80-84, and females 85+.
13

Until 1997, managed care organizations were reimbursed for their Medicare enrollees by a
capitated fee based on 95% of the lagged value of regional fee-for-service expenditures, so that
fee-for-service expenditures within a region would have been a reasonable measure of the
managed care capitation fee. While the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 severed that close link, it is
not expected that the relatively small fraction of Medicare managed care enrollees would bias
these results.

10

However, the rates of growth by income group are quite different; the bottom decile
experienced a 78 percent increase in real expenditures, in contrast to the top decile with
just a 34 percent increase.
The advantage of health care dollar expenditures is that these changes in spending
can be compared to changes over the same period of time in median money income, as
measured in the Current Population Survey. The median increase in family income
during the period 1987-2001 was $2551.14 In 1993, the average household size of elderly
people living either along or with a spouse was 1.47,15 so the per capita increase in
income per elderly person was $1735 = $2551/1.47. Note that the dollar increase in
expenditures for the lowest income decile was $2624, compared to $1214 for the highest
income group. Thus the size of the differential increase (or “twist”) in Medicare
expenditures was $1410 ($2624 minus $1214) or the amount of money that would have
been left “on the table” had Medicare costs for the lowest income group grown at the
same rate as the highest income group. This differential increase is therefore 81 percent
of the total increase in money income for the elderly population during 1987-2001. It is
also larger than the average level of per capita benefits from the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) program, estimated to be $1287 (in 2001 dollars) among the near-poor
(Short and Garner, 2002). Unlike the EITC, the redistribution occurring in the Medicare

living with other relatives or with unrelated people, and assumed the spouse was also age 65+.

11

program was largely unintended, and the differential benefits to the lowest income group
are still not well understood.16
Why the differential growth in expenditures? One reason was the growth in the
Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) program that provided higher reimbursements
for hospitals in low income neighborhoods (see Baicker and Staiger, 2004). Another
factor was the rapid expansion of home health care during the 1990s. Beginning in the
late 1980s, when restrictions on the use of home health care were eased, there were
dramatic increases in the use of home health care particularly in certain regions of the
U.S. such as Texas, Florida, and Tennessee (Wennberg and Cooper, 1999). Because of
the rapid growth in expenditures, and an accompanying increase in scandals, Congress
restricted its use sharply in 1997. These expenditures for home health care were
concentrated to a large extent in the poorest zip codes of the U.S.17 Figure 2 tabulates
average home health care spending for the 80+ population (the most common users of
home health care) by year for the lowest income Decile 1, Deciles 5, and the highest
income Decile 10. These are measures of spending per Medicare enrollee age 80 and
older, and not restricted just to users of home health care. There was rapid growth in
home health care expenditures for all income groups, but the growth for Decile 1 was

16

One shortcoming with these changes in Medicare expenditures is that we do not have similar
data on Medicaid expenditures. In theory, a decline in Medicaid expenditures among the low
income groups could have been offset by this sharp increase in Medicare expenditures, with no
net impact on transfers to lower income neighborhoods. However, Medicaid expenditure data by
state and by year for home health care expenditures provides little support for this explanation.
While Medicaid programs in New York were spending more on recipients than in Texas in 1991
($623 versus $74), by 1997 the spending levels had not changed appreciably ($647 in New York,
$146 in Texas). Source: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/statistics/nhe/state-estimatesresidence/medicaid-per-capita50.asp

particularly notable, rising to $1635 per elderly enrollee before dropping after 1997 when
the Balanced Budget Act clamped down on unrestricted use.
How much of this spending benefited low income patients, either through
improved survival or improved quality of life? In 1997, a report by the General
Accounting Office suggested that 40% of all home health care costs were “inappropriate”
(Havemann, 1997). In this case, inappropriate care included either fraud (e.g., a physician
prescribing tests for sexually transmitted diseases to all of his home health care patients)
or that the patient simply was not eligible for home health care. A recent paper by Robin
McKnight (2004) did not find adverse health consequences caused by the sharp decline in
home health care benefits in 1997, although there was a modest consequent increase in
out-of-pocket medical expenses. In short, one should be cautious about attributing all
dollar increases in Medicare expenditures to the people who nominally “receive” the
benefit.18 Home health care is not the only service provided during the 1990s that may
have also benefited providers’ bank accounts, but it was certainly the most visible.19
3. The Distribution of Survival Gains by Income
We next consider overall survival gains in the Medicare population. Here the
sample includes not just the fee-for-service population but also the HMO enrollees; this is
to avoid potential selection bias caused by healthier individuals joining managed care
18

This is the basic insight of tax incidence studies, the tax burden does not necessarily fall on the
people who pay the tax. Similarly, government benefits do not necessarily flow to the people
whose names are on the checks.
19

Another cause for the rapid increase in health care expenditures during the 1990s was
upcoding whereby hospitals switched patients from low-reimbursement to high-reimbursement
diagnostic related groups (Silverman and Skinner, 2004) and effectively increased the price
charged per Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG). Upcoding, which is distinguishable from “bracket
creep” by the absence of supporting evidence for the more expensive coding, was curtailed
sharply also around 1997 following well-publicized investigations of a large for-profit hospital
chain.

13

organizations. We consider two different cohorts from the Continuous Medicare History
Survey. The first is the group of people age 65-69 and 75-79 alive in 1982, and the
second is the corresponding group alive at age 1992. Figure 3 shows the percentage of
the groups age 65-69 in the initial year who were still alive ten years later by sex and year
of the cohort by income decile. There is a clear income gradient in both years; people
living in higher zip code incomes were more likely to survive during both the 1980s and
1990s. A similar pattern is shown for those aged 75-79 in 1982 and 1992, detailed in
Table 2, with life expectancy rising by more for men than for women. While all groups
gained in terms of survival probabilities, the highest income groups gained the most, both
in percentage and in absolute terms.
To quantify these changes in terms of the change in expected survival years, we
chain together the two panels of 10 year survival curves for the younger and older
cohorts, and estimate the change in expected survival years for a synthetic cohort over a
20 year period (from 65-69 to 85-89) with fixed weights for men and women based on
the fraction of women in the age 65-69 cohort (54.8 percent). There was a 0.2 increase in
expected life years in the bottom income decile, a 0.5 increase in the 5th decile, and a 0.8
increase in the top income decile.20
4. Inequality in the Provision of Effective Care
Here we focus on specific measures of effective care, considering first mammography
rates among women age 65-69 in the Medicare population. The advantage of using

20

Recent work has focused on placing a dollar value to increased survival, see Becker, Philipson,
and Soares (2003) or Berloffa, Brugiavini, and Rizzi (2003). A different approach to quantifying
the changes over time in survival is the concentration index, a variant of a Gini coefficient
(Contoyannis and Forster, 1999). However, changes in the index were very small since we were
just considering inequality in the over 65 population and not over the entire life-course.

14

mammography rates is that we have a time-series on rates of screening from 1993-2001
and so can measure changes over time in screening rates. A 5% sample of Part B
physician claims data is used from 1993-1997, and a 20% sample from 1998-2001. The
later 20% sample also includes hospital outpatient data as separate from physician-based
claims, these would include women who were screened for example in a hospital-based
clinic. In theory, not including such outpatient records for all years could bias our results
if low income women were more likely to receive care in an outpatient setting. In
practice, as we show using data from 1998-2001, the bias is small or non-existent.
Figure 4 shows rates of screening by year for selected income deciles for just the
physician claims, these are comparable over time. Reported in brackets during 19982001 are rates that include the outpatient screening data; while raising all rates the
relative magnitudes by income group are largely unchanged.
There is a pronounced income gradient in screening rates that persists throughout
the period of analysis. In 1993, the range in screening rates (between Decile 1 and Decile
10) was 16 percentage points, while in 2001, the range had shrunk slightly to 15
percentage points. A notable feature of the data is the sharp jump in rates between 1997
and 1998. This was the consequence of removing the $100 coinsurance payment on
January 1, 1998 and allowing reimbursement for annual rather than biannual screening.
It is surprising that rates for all income groups appear to have risen by about the same
amount, given that low income households should have been most sensitive to the
relaxation of the $100 copayment.
Similar results for 1998-2001 were also found in comparing rates of screening for
eye examinations among patients with diabetics. These examinations check for damage

15

to the vascular system caused by high uncontrolled blood glucose levels (available upon
request from the authors). While encompassing a shorter time period, there was similarly
no evidence of trends in the income-based gradient of screening for diabetic eye
examinations.
Of course, some part of the income-based differential could be the consequence of
noncompliance; that is that lower income patients don’t sign up or show up for their
screening appointment. We therefore consider physician directives or procedures
performed in the first few days following acute myocardial infarction, where the primary
goal of the physician is to keep the patient alive, and patient preferences and
noncompliance issues should play a small role. The measures of effective care for heart
attack patients are derived from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP) survey of
more than 160,000 AMI patients over age 65 in 1994/95. The survey information
included detailed clinical data from chart reviews along with information on how the
patient was treated. This allowed clinical researchers to determine from the chart data
patients who were “ideal” or appropriate for the use of the specific treatment; thus the
right rate should be a number near 100 percent, regardless of health status, income, age,
or any other characteristic. For this reason, we do not control for covariates or health
indices, but consider simple averages by income decile.
Table 4 presents income-based differences in utilization of effective care along
with the total sample size in the bottom row. Approximate 95% confidence intervals are
presented at the bottom of the table; these apply to each of the means in the column
because the deciles ensure equal sample sizes and the exact binomial confidence intervals
are based on the average ratio.

16

Table 4 suggests that in 1994/95, utilization of these measures were remarkably
low. For example, the use of

Blockers was less than half of appropriate patients when

the target rates should have been closer to 100 percent. Second, rates of use for effective
care were modestly elevated among higher income groups; for example in

Blockers,

rates ranged from 40 percent in the bottom income decile to 47 percent in the top decile.
Indeed, for some treatments, such as ACE inhibitors used to control hypertension, there
were no income-based difference in utilization.
One additional question is whether high income individuals are more likely to
receive higher quality care because of treatment differences within regions, or because
they are more likely to live in regions where overall effective care rates are higher
(Chandra and Skinner, 2003). In Figure 5 utilization rates for

Blockers are estimated

with and without categorical regional variables. First, the previous results are replicated
in a logistics regression coefficients converted to percentage screening rates. State
dummy variables are then introduced and the logistics regression is re-estimated, again
with odds ratios converted to probabilities, and shown in Figure 5. The adjusted
probability of

Blocker use holding constant the state of residence shows just a 3.6

percentage point difference by income group rather than a 7 percentage point difference.
(In this latter regression, only the 8th and 10th decile coefficients were significantly
different from zero.) That is, half of the income gradient here is the consequence of
where patients live and not how patients are treated within regions. The result does not
generalize, however. A similar analysis for mammography screening and diabetic eye

17

exams during 1998-2001 did not suggest any diminution in the effects of income on
utilization rates after controlling for region of residence.21
In theory, we would like to know how the income gradient in

Blocker use

evolved over time, but we have just one observation from the survey in 1994/95. Since
the use of

Blockers for heart attack patients were rare before the early 1980s, we may

safely infer that the observed difference in 1994/95 reflects a somewhat higher growth
rate in the use of

Blockers among the top income deciles, at least through 1994/95.

Since then, compliance has improved, but in 2001 median compliance is still less than 70
percent (Jencks, 2003). It is possible that rates of compliance have risen more rapidly in
low income regions, but Alabama was low in the use of

Blockers in 1994/95 and it

remained relatively low in 2001.
5. Conclusions and Discussion
How should one judge whether inequality in health has improved or worsened
during the past several decades? This paper has considered several alternative
approaches to measuring inequality using US data from the elderly Medicare population
over age 65. While Medicare expenditures grew much more rapidly among the lowest
income deciles, health outcomes improved much less rapidly for this group. Economists
and health services researchers have long recognized the distinction between inequality in
health care (as measured by expenditures) and inequality in health (as measured by
survival), beginning at least with Victor Fuchs’ comparison of Nevada and Utah, two

21

In this case, because the sample sizes were so much larger, we were able to use the 306
hospital referral regions (Wennberg and Cooper, 1999) as regional controls instead of states as in
the analysis of blockers.

18

states with similar health care expenditures but very different mortality rates (Fuchs,
1998b).
We suggest a different approach to measuring inequality that relies on effective
care, or measures of health care quality. For these measures, efficacy is well proven and
nearly all of the relevant population should be receiving it, regardless of health status or
preferences. A examination of the past decade suggests that there has been little or no
relative improvement in the utilization of effective care measures among lower income
deciles. Thus the discordance between rapidly rising health expenditures of low income
households and rapidly rising longevity of high income households is not quite so
puzzling.
It should be cautioned that the magnitudes of the differences in effective care
observed in the data would not be expected to exert a large impact on overall mortality
rates. The predicted impact on heart attack patients of a 7 percentage point increase in
blocker use (i.e., the difference between the top and bottom income decile rate of use) is a
0.21 percentage point decline in mortality, or an overall impact on the general population
of about 0.01 percent since just 5 percent of the Medicare population experience a heart
attack in any year.22 The fact that these measures of effective care account for a small
fraction of overall expenditures, and a small fraction of the overall variation in health
outcomes, motivates interest in other measures of quality, for example with regard to the
overuse of marginally effective procedures (Fisher, et. al., 2003a,b).

22

The 0.21 percent shift is derived by multiplying 7 percentage points times the implied 3
percentage point reduction in one-year mortality estimated by using an odds ratio (estimated for
30 day mortality) of 0.88 reported in Heidenrich and McClellan (2001).

19

There are three important limitation of this study. The first is that in using
outcome data, we have focused only on survival and not quality-adjusted or “healthy life
years.” To capture a more full measure of health, it would be necessary to include
income-based differentials in treatments with proven effectiveness but for improving
functioning rather than survival per se. Examples include hip or knee replacements for
the treatment of osteoarthritis or the use of angioplasty for patients with ischemic heart
disease. However, measuring true income-based differences in health status is more
difficult, given the necessity of adjusting for differential health needs (i.e., rates of
osteoarthritis of the hip by income group) and for preferences (however defined)
regarding surgical intervention.23
Second, the study is limited to just the over-65 population. Focusing just on
income-based differences in mammography rates within the Medicare program ignores
the fact that Medicare itself contributes to a substantial increase in mammography rates at
age 65 among those previously uncovered by insurance or in lower educational groups
(Decker, 2004; Card, Dobkin, and Maestas, 2004). Focusing just on inequality within a
specific age group ignores changes in inequality across age groups, for example
differences between those under age 65 who are increasingly lacking health insurance,
and those over age 65 who are generally covered (Danziger, Haveman, and Smolensky,
1977).
Finally, we have not considered the financing side of the Medicare program.
During the 1990s payments both rose and became more progressive as general income
taxes became a larger source of revenue (McClellan and Skinner, 2004). The new
23

Chen and Escarce (2004) for example attempt to control for income-based differences in health
status along a wide variety of dimensions.

20

prescription drug benefits passed into law in 2003 should also contribute to an increasing
degree of redistribution to the extent the future growth in benefits are financed out of
general tax revenue. Whether increased progressivity in the Medicare program would
justify the increased longevity of higher income households is not entirely clear,
however.
A singular advantage of focusing on equality in effective care (or quality of care)
is that there are reasonable approaches to fixing the problem. Monitoring claims data in
real time with the objective of raising rates to ideal levels of near 100% among
appropriate candidates is one sure way to at least reduce income-based inequality in
health outcomes. Inequality in outcomes would continue to persist for many years, of
course, but at least such differences would not be exacerbated by inequality in health
care. Indeed, one could imagine “non-discrimination” rules like those developed for
401(k) pension plans in which hospitals or health care systems would experience a partial
loss in Medicare funding if effective care measures for their low income patients fell too
far below those for their high income patients.
