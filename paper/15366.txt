Who Counts in Evaluating the Effects of Air Pollution Policies on Households? Non-Market
Valuation in the Presence of Dependencies

JEL No. H41,Q51
ABSTRACT
Individuals who are likely to realize the largest benefits from improvements in air quality often depend
on other members of their households to make time or monetary contributions to their care. The presence
of these dependency relationships among household members poses challenges for benefit estimation
since it is unlikely that the conditions necessary for recovering the underlying individual preferences
from household choices are satisfied in this setting. We propose a conceptual framework that highlights
the role of these dependencies in the choice models used to estimate the willingness to pay for environmental
quality improvements. We design a complementary stated preference survey that describes hypothetical
dependency relationships for household members of different ages to test the implications of our conceptual
model. Respondents’ choices take into account the care-giving responsibilities for young children
and teenagers but not for older adults.

I. Introduction
When does a child become an economic agent? When do the limitations that arise
with advanced age and/or serious health conditions initiate an exit from full economic
agency? How do these transitions into and out of economic agency affect dependencies,
such as care-giving activities, among family members? Answering these questions
requires a model that describes how dependency relationships function among members
of a household. This paper begins to develop such a model and evaluates the
performance of a strategy for framing stated choice questions to determine how different
types of dependency relationships affect willingness to pay for policy changes that alter
features of those relationships.
The conventional model of consumer behavior maintains that the observed (or
stated) choices of economic agents (either individuals or households) can be described as
if they arose from a single, coherent preference function. This framework asserts that
choices result from maximizing this function subject to the budget constraint faced by the
individual or the household. For example, the unitary model of household decision
making assumes that household behavior stems from the preference function of a single
member of the household and a household budget constraint that reflects the household
income pooled over all sources of income (Becker [1974]). Thus, household choices are
independent of the source of income. A number of studies report evidence against the
unitary model and income pooling (e.g., Lundberg et al. [1997]). Alternatives to the
unitary model, including Nash-bargained (McElroy [1990]), and collective models
(Chiappori [1988]) invoke different assumptions regarding the process that underlies
household decision making.

3

In one of the most recent extensions of the theory underlying the collective model,
Chiappori and Ekeland [2009] assess the conditions under which aggregate observed
behavior (i.e., revealed preferences) provides sufficient information on the structure of
preferences and decision making processes for groups of individuals. They model a twostage group decision making process. Resources are allocated among group (or
household) members in the first stage and individuals make choices conditional on that
allocation in the second stage. Their analysis suggests two important conditions on the
identifiabilty of household preferences: “First, the general version of the [collective]
model is not identifiable. A continuum of different models generates the same household
demand function. Second, one exclusion condition for each member – for each member
there is a commodity this member does not consume – is sufficient to generically
guarantee full identifiability of …the welfare-relevant concept that summarizes
preferences and the decision processes” (p. 793, bracketed words inserted).1 Combined
with previous results from the literature on collective household models, these results
imply that the underlying preferences of all household members can be recovered from
observed household behavior when (1) the budget sharing process (and each member’s
role in it) is well-understood and characterized and (2) each member is an independent
economic agent in the sense that she consumes at least one good exclusively and there are
well defined access conditions for the other goods of interest based on observed
household choices.
In estimating the benefits to improved environmental quality, where household
models are especially relevant in informing policy, neither setting is likely. For example,

1

The presence of distribution factors, variables that influence the group decision making process but do not
affect individual utilities directly, eliminates the required exclusion conditions.

4

most of the benefits from lower ambient concentrations of the criteria air pollutants arise
through reductions in the risks of health effects associated with exposure to these
pollutants. Young children and older adults are particularly susceptible to these risks.2
Children and older individuals who experience severe air pollution-related illnesses may
require care-giving from other household members. As a result, policies that improve air
quality and therefore reduce the incidence of the associated health effect indirectly
benefit care-givers and other members of the household through changes in time and
income allocations within the household as well as different consumption patterns. In
other words, the income sharing rule and the allocation of time and goods among
household members may depend on how pollutants affect the health status of specific
members. The necessary restrictions to recover the underlying household structure from
revealed preference data discussed above are unlikely to apply for these types of
applications. Thus, the presence of dependency relationships complicates the
identification of individual preferences. Given this challenge, we propose the use of
stated preference studies (or a composite of stated and revealed preference information)
to examine the tradeoffs individuals are willing to make when environmental externalities
affect household dependency relationships.
Our explicit consideration of dependency relationships among household
members differs from the focus of other recent stated preference studies (e.g., Bateman
and Munro [2009] and Lindhjem and Navrud [2009]) also designed to better understand
the nature of household decision making. Bateman and Munro [2009] examine decision
making with respect to household food consumption among couples by comparing the

associated with infants and children and Evans and Smith [2005] for older adults.

5

responses of individual members of couples interviewed separately to the responses
couples provided when jointly interviewed. Their results suggest no general rule
governing the relationship between the tradeoffs implied by individual and group
responses. Focusing on the person in the household responsible for food purchases
attenuates the differences but does not offer a viable basis for predicting the group
responses. While the results support rejecting the unitary model for the household and
are therefore consistent with other studies, the authors conclude that their evaluation does
not offer guidance on who within a household should be interviewed for assessing
household tradeoffs. The study by Lindhjem and Navrud [2009] asks each respondent to
provide responses to household and individual willingness to pay (WTP) questions based
on a payment card format. Respondents were randomly assigned to different versions of
the survey, which varied the order of the personal and household WTP questions. In a
cross-sample comparison of responses from the first question (either individual or
household depending on the survey version), the study reports no significant difference
between average household and individual WTP measures. The within-sample
comparison based on the two responses provided by each respondent finds higher mean
values from the responses using the household framing of the willingness to pay question.
The authors conclude that respondent understanding of the individual or household
perspectives may not align with analysts’ assumptions. As a result, they call for research
that considers the framing of dependency relationships as part of the structuring of stated
choice questions. Our approach is consistent with this appeal.
We consider a new framing for stated choice questions, which involves proposing
hypothetical dependency relationships to survey respondents and evaluating whether

6

these relationships influence choices among air pollution policies. Our results provide
direct tests of the effect of different types of dependency relationships on caregivers’
choices. A simple non-parametric test and a formal choice model both suggest that,
conditional on the level of care-giving time (the commodity of interest), the
characterization of household dependency relationships does influence an individual’s
choices. Moreover, they indicate what appears to be an implicit delineation of personal
responsibility to different types of household members. Respondents’ choices appear to
acknowledge the importance of care-giving for young children and teenagers. They do
not appear to attach the same importance to older adults.
Section II develops the conceptual basis for our evaluation of how dependency
relationships among household members may influence responses to stated preference
questions describing policy changes that would affect the intensity of that dependency.
The third section describes the Internet-based survey used to test the hypotheses
developed in Section II. Section IV presents our findings and the last section discusses
their implications for using stated choice surveys to evaluate environmental policies that
influence pre-existing dependencies among members of an extended family.

II. Developing choice models that account for dependency relationships
Compared to the unitary framework, a key component of the collective model is
the distinction between individual income and household income. In the collective
model, the choices of each individual are made conditional on the allocation stage of the
household decision process. We abstract from explicitly modeling the allocation stage.
However, our analysis acknowledges that the outcome of this process, which defines the

7

distribution of household income among a household’s members, will influence the level
of well-being each household member can realize.
We implicitly account for the allocation stage by representing the role of other
household members through an income share function, denoted θ (⋅) , which describes the
portion of household income allocated to the respondent of interest. With more than one
agent, θ i (⋅) represents the share of household income allocated to member i with
I

∑θ (⋅) = 1 where I is the total number of household members.
i =1

i

From the perspective of interpreting stated choice questions, one basis for
distinguishing a unitary and a collective model arises from respondents acknowledging
differences between their own individual income and household income. For example, if
a respondent answers a question failing to recognize this distinction and the possibility
that the proposed change could impact the distribution of income within the household,
then his choices provide information that could be used to create a measure of personal or
individual WTP. By contrast if an individual’s responses reflect an anticipated income
reallocation within the household arising from the proposed change, then those responses
imply an alternative measure of WTP that is at least potentially consistent with the
collective framework. Of course, recognition of income reallocation alone does not
guarantee that choices reflect the maximum household willingness to pay for a proposed
change.
Ideally, a measure of household WTP for a policy change would be constructed
holding constant the levels of well-being realized by each member of the household at
their initial levels. A coordinated survey of all household members would be needed to

8

separate the two stages that describe the decision making process. Without information
about household income reallocation and members’ wellbeing, we cannot assume a
household WTP measure can be recovered from a survey that focuses on a single
member.
Our survey is intended to judge the importance of dependency relationships
without knowing all the details of the income allocation process within a household. We
use a framing that asks respondents to imagine a member of their household has a
specific type of dependency. The stated choice question defines a level of care that must
be provided to this hypothetical dependent due to a severe health condition. The
proposed policy reduces environmental pollution that affects the health condition and,
thus, the need for care. By introducing this suggested relationship we attempt to induce
the respondent to consider how the presence of the dependency would affect income
allocation within the household.
Policy changes can alter θ (⋅) . To describe the implications of such changes, we
contrast how a policy’s impacts on the hypothetical dependent would be evaluated
relative to the same policy’s impacts on the respondent’s own health. To develop what
can be learned from such linked choice questions (e.g., health impacts on a hypothetical
dependent versus on the respondent) our analysis begins by considering different
interpretations of how θ (⋅) might change in response to that policy. Using a simple linear
indirect utility model, we relate the two choices to hypotheses describing what
distinguishes a unitary from a collective decision process. This framework provides the

9

basis for judging whether the nature of dependency is likely to affect the process of
eliciting willingness to pay. 3
Our survey design describes three different types of hypothetical dependent
household members, a young child (2-5 years of age), a teen (15-17 years of age), and an
older adult (63 years or older). Regardless of age, each hypothetical household member
is described as asthmatic. In each case, management of the dependent’s asthma requires
that the respondent devote a fixed amount of time each week to care-giving. The survey
also describes a policy change that would improve air quality and as a result reduce the
required weekly care-giving time. Each version of the survey proposes one type of
hypothetical dependent (either a young child, teen, or older adult). Versions were
randomly assigned to respondents. Each respondent also received a similar question
about managing his or her own (hypothetical) asthma condition.
The income available to each respondent is given by mR = θ (⋅) ⋅ m where m is
household income. If the respondent considers the full household willingness to pay for a
proposed policy change, then his or her answers will be based on HWTP = m 0 − m *
where m 0 is the household income under the current or initial conditions and m * is the
income required to realize the initial level of well being for each household member with
the proposed policy change.
The alternative WTP measures we construct below motivate two hypotheses.
First, we hypothesize that the age of the household member benefiting from an

3

We assume that the only effect of the policy on the respondent is through changes in care-giving time. In
fact, our analysis can consider additional policy effects aside from care-giving without changing our main
findings. This ability stems from the linked design of the questions. Additional changes assumed to stem
from the policy will contribute to the differences in a respondent’s choices for the two questions -- for self
versus for a dependent member. Our design does not allow us to separately identify the effects of the policy
on each of these aspects (e.g., care-giving time, other policy effects).

10

environmental health improvement enters the income sharing function. Our choice of
three age groups, child, teen, and older adult, is deliberate. We focus on these age groups
to exploit variation among these age groups on the basis of the likelihood and intensity of
care-giving requirements. Children represent those family members most likely to
require care-giving while care-givers may afford teens some level of independence,
subject to the limitations associated with their health state. Older adults, on the other
hand, represent family members who may be entering a period of uncertainty with respect
to dependency, in which the care they require is determined in part by their health. Given
this proposed relationship, we derive its implications for the structure of the respondent’s
choice function. Second, and equally important, we describe several alternative ways
each respondent might evaluate the implications of the proposed change for the income
sharing process within the household. The analyst does not know whether (and if so,
how) each respondent will incorporate income re-allocation into the answers to the policy
choice questions.
We derive three WTP measures that vary in the way in which they account for
possible changes in the household income allocation that arise from the proposed policy.
Equation (1) specifies the indirect utility function
V = α 0 + α1 P + α 2π (L, n, w, c ) + α 3mR .

(1)

P is a vector for the prices of all other goods. The respondent’s income is given by
m R = θ (L, n, c, z )m where n denotes the number of household members, L is the quasi-

fixed care-giving time required, c designates the age group of the hypothetical family
member requiring care, and z represents other covariates that affect the sharing rule.

π (L, n, w, c ) denotes a function representing the implicit cost of care-giving. The effect

11

of the care-giving requirement depends on a variety of factors that are likely to vary
across households; L, n, and c are defined above, w is the price of materials for care (e.g.,
medications, equipment).
Let V 0 represent the respondent’s initial (indirect) utility without the reduction in
air pollution. Therefore equation (2) defines the benchmark condition.

(

)

V 0 = α 0 + α 1 P + α 2π L0 , n, w, c + α 3 m R0

(2)

where m R0 = θ (L0 , n, c, z )m 0 . To describe the implications of differences in what the
respondent assumes about income reallocation when answering the choice questions, we
solve expressions describing the respondent’s indirect utility for alternative concepts of
respondent and household income. Inverting V 0 in equation (2) yields an expression for
m R0 : in equation (3).

π (L1 , n, w, c ) . For this exposition, we assume π (L0 , n, w, c ) − π (L1 , n, w, c ) > 0 .4 With

budgeting of household resources such that the individual’s share of household income
changes.
Define the willingness to pay (WTP) for this change as the difference between the
household income required to sustain the respondent’s initial utility level at the two
shadow prices of care-giving:5
~0 − m
~1 .
WTP = m

(4)

~ denotes the household income that we, as analysts, infer based on responses to the
m

choice questions. If we assume the responses incorporate some revision in the income
sharing rule, then conditional on the arguments in the sharing function, we expect one set
of factors to influence responses. Alternatively, without budget reallocation, another set
of factors would be relevant. Each of these possibilities implies a different distribution of
well-being within the household.
To describe the first WTP measure, suppose that the respondent bases his
decisions on the initial household income with the initial sharing function describing how

Thus our first WTP measure, denoted WTP * , accounts for both the reduction in the
implicit cost of required care-giving associated with the reduction in L and the effect of
the resulting reallocation of household resources. Although WTP * reflects the
implications of the policy for the distribution of income within the household, it does not
assure that all household members remain at their initial levels of well-being. The
respondent’s choices could reflect a new point in the set of household utility
combinations that are feasible with given resources and constraints.
As an alternative to WTP * , assume the respondent begins his decision making
process by accounting for how the change in care-giving time would alter the distribution
of resources within the household. In this case, the respondent’s initial income level and
baseline utility must take account of the anticipated adjustment. The respondent’s
baseline utility would be given by:6
Vˆ 0 = α 0 + α 1 P + α 2π (L0 , n, w, c ) + α 3θ (L1 , n, c, z )m 0 .

Comparisons of equations (11), (15), and (20) highlight how different assumptions about
the impact of proposed changes on the distribution of household resources lead to
different WTP values.
All three formulations imply the WTP governing choice will be a nonlinear
function of the care-giving time. If dependency relationships affect the evaluation of
care-giving time then we expect comparisons of our linked choice questions, that hold all
other dimensions constant and vary only who is affected, to offer a robust test of the role

17

of c. Under a wide range of specifications for π (⋅) , together with different income
sharing rules, the research strategy isolates the effects of different types of dependencies.
That is, by describing the same policy change for the respondent and for a hypothetical
dependent with different characteristics, we are able to isolate how the dependency
relationships influence choices.
In addition, with a parameterized model, distinctions among the various WTP
measures can be identified through the household income term. Focusing on the
household income terms in our estimated WTP functions will also allow us to identify
departures from a unitary framework.7 Given the nonlinearity of the WTP measures, the
parametric models we use to describe respondents’ choices are best interpreted as linear
approximations.
By making assumptions about the budget allocation process and dependency
explicit in our model and developing a stated preference strategy that specifies the nature
of dependencies, our approach overcomes some of the challenges of recovering
underlying household preference structures identified in previous research.

III. Design of the survey

We use a “hypothetical dependency” as a mechanism to evaluate whether choices
vary with the nature of dependency relationships among household members.8 To our

Note that while our three WTP formulations recognize income reallocation albeit in different ways, the
WTP measure implied by a similarly structured unitary model would fail to do this. WTP in this case
would be given by: −

We conducted a series of focus groups in August 2005 to explore care-giving. Each individual reported
different care-giving experiences, which suggested challenges in successfully developing stated choice
questions based on actual care-giving experiences. As a result we developed the hypothetical care-giving

18

knowledge, hypothetical dependency relationships have not been explored in stated
preference research. Our survey evaluates whether respondents comprehend this framing
as representing the nature of dependency relationships. We also consider whether this
framing successfully conveys the information required to understand household
behaviors that reflect the jointness in the allocation of time and money among household
members assumed in most household models.
Our sample uses Knowledge Network’s (KN) Internet panel. KN’s panel is
selected from households that are recruited using random digit dialing (RDD). The
invitation to participate in our survey was sent to 2,670 panelists aged 18 and over on
June 7, 2006. The invitation indicated that the survey was about respondents’ health.9 A
reminder email was sent three days later to respondents who had not yet completed the
survey. By June 22, 2006, a total of 2,110 panelists (79% of invited panelists) completed
interviews. The duration of the interview is measured by KN as the number of minutes
between when the survey is begun and when it is completed. Fifty percent of respondents
completed the interview within 10 minutes and 92% completed the interview within 30
minutes. Only four percent of the sample took longer than 60 minutes to complete the
interview.
KN provided socioeconomic and demographic data on all of the panelists that
were invited to take the survey – including both survey respondents and non-respondents.

scenario and a specific set of time requirements to avoid the possibility of encountering different (and
unobservable) understandings of care-giving activities across respondents. Of course, actual care-giving
experiences are likely to influence respondent’s choices regarding a hypothetical care-giving relationship.
Thus, we control for actual care-giving experiences in our regression analysis.

The subject of the email was “Your Health” and the body of the email read: “This week we’d like you to
participate in a survey about your health. We believe that you will find the survey very interesting. We’d
appreciate your completing the survey at your first convenience. Thank you in advance for your time and
participation.”

19

These data on non-respondents permit us to estimate a selection model and implement
sample selection correction in the regression analysis described in Section IV.10
The survey comprised four main sections: family support, asthma, choice
questions, and debriefing. The first section asked respondents whether they provided
either financial support and/or spent time providing care for any family members in the
following eight age groups: 0-1 years, 2-5 years, 6-11 years, 12-14 years, 15-17 years,
18-55 years, 56-62 years, and 63+ years. To help respondents understand these
questions, the survey described examples of these types of support. They were told that
financial support includes buying food, paying for housing or healthcare, and paying for
education, and that time spent providing care for a family member includes helping a
family member run errands or helping them with daily activities such as preparing food
or bathing. Respondents were also told that family members include live-in relatives and
non-relatives (e.g., step-children), as well as family who live elsewhere.
The second section described asthma11 and asked respondents whether any of the
family members they support (with time or money) had been diagnosed with asthma.
These responses were recorded using the age categories that matched the family support
questions.

10
11

For a more detailed analysis of sample selection in the KN panel, see Cameron and DeShazo [2005].
Asthma was described as follows:
“Asthma is a disease that affects an individual’s airways. When an individual has asthma, the
inside walls of the airways are swollen and can be irritated by triggers such as pollen, dust, and air
pollution. A person with asthma may have difficulty sleeping. It may be difficult for them to
walk or climb stairs, or to be physically active.
When asthma symptoms are worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack. Asthma attacks are
not all the same—some are more serious than others. A mild or moderate asthma attack causes
symptoms like wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and trouble breathing. In a severe asthma
attack, the airways can close so much that air does not get to vital organs. This condition is a
medical emergency.”

20

The third section described a hypothetical dependency relationship as part of a
series of two double-bounded contingent valuation questions. The order of the two
scenarios was randomly assigned. Respondents were asked to consider each situation
independently. One of the scenarios asked the respondent to assume that he personally
has asthma and the other scenario asked him to assume that he spends time caring for
someone (other than himself) who has asthma. The respondent was told that this other
person was in one of three age groups: young child (2-5 years), teenager (15-17 years), or
older adult (63+ years). The age groups were randomly assigned as described below.
Each respondent saw only one age-specific hypothetical dependency scenario and was
unaware of the age groups in other scenarios.
Each scenario has the same structure, beginning with a description of two
methods that deliver asthma medicine but take different amounts of time for
administration.12 The slower delivery method is described as using a nebulizer to create a
medicated mist that is inhaled through a mask and takes 10 to 20 minutes per dose. The
second method proposes that the patient uses an inhaler, which delivers asthma
12

Asthma treatment was described as follows:
“Asthma cannot be cured, but doctors help many people with asthma control their symptoms using
medications and other treatments. There are two different ways that some asthma medications can
be delivered – one that is slower and one that is faster.
The slower delivery method uses a device called a nebulizer. The nebulizer creates a mist out of
the asthma drug which makes it easy and pleasant to breathe the drug into the lungs using a mask
or mouthpiece. By taking slow, deep breaths, the medicine gets into the lungs.
The faster method uses a device called an inhaler. The inhaler delivers the same medication as the
nebulizer in less time. The two ways cost the same and have the same side effects.
A doctor determines which delivery method is appropriate for a person with asthma. Many factors
influence the doctor’s choice of method, including the presence of uncontrollable asthma triggers.
The doctor may recommend changing methods if the conditions that affect a person’s asthma
change.
The way people take asthma medicine affects the amount of time they spend taking medicine as
well as the amount of time they have available to do other things.”

21

medication more quickly (1-2 minutes). Respondents were told that physicians prescribe
the delivery method based on several factors including the presence of uncontrollable
asthma triggers. Respondents were also told that the medications delivered using the two
methods were similar in terms of price, side effects, and effectiveness.
Respondents were told that the asthma was moderately severe, requiring the use
of a nebulizer and L0 hours per week of the respondent’s time to assist the person with
the nebulizer. L0 took on a value of 3 hours or 8 hours. One value was randomly
assigned to each respondent. “Moderately severe” asthma was described by saying that
without medicine the person would frequently experience asthma symptoms that would
make it difficult to breathe, sleep, play, or exercise.
Respondents were told that a proposed new policy requiring cleaner industrial
technologies in their area would reduce air pollutants and, as a direct result, reduce one
important influence on the person’s asthma. The improved air quality would allow the
asthmatic to switch from the nebulizer to an inhaler, which would reduce the required
amount of care-giving time. While the cost of medication would remain the same, the
policy would reduce the respondent’s weekly time commitment for managing asthma
from L0 (3 hours or 8 hours) to L1 , which was always described as one hour, saving
L0 − L1 (2 hours or 7 hours) hours each week. Each respondent was also told that the

policy will lead to higher electricity prices and increased income taxes resulting in
increased monthly costs (T) of $5, $30, $70, or $150. Respondents were reminded that
these costs would occur each month for many years and would be in addition to their
typical monthly expenditures.

22

After viewing a table that summarized the key attributes of the choice, the
respondents faced a double-bounded discrete choice question. The question was: “Would
you support this policy and be willing to pay for it?” If the respondent said “no,” then
they were asked whether they would support and pay for the policy if the cost were
reduced to one half the initially proposed amount per month. If the respondent said “yes”
to the initial question, they were asked whether they would support and pay for the policy
if the cost was twice their initially proposed amount.
The design involves four different choice attributes with levels as follows: age of
the hypothetical dependant (young child, teenager, older adult), time savings due to the
program (2 hours or 7 hours), monthly expenditure for the policy ($5, $30, $70, and
$150) and the order of the scenarios (self first, self second). These attribute levels were
combined to create 48 (=3x2x4x2) different versions of the questionnaire (see Table 1 in
the Appendix). Respondents were randomly assigned to one of these versions. Each
version of the questionnaire holds the values of L0 , L1 , and T constant across the two
scenarios.

IV. Analysis and results

We test the general implications of our conceptual model in two ways. The first
involves non-parametric tests that examine the impact of dependency relationships on
stated choices for policies that change care-giving time absent a formal structure for the
choice model. This approach avoids making more explicit the treatment of the income
sharing issues we raised above. The survey design is structured to link the two choice
occasions for each respondent, with questions varying only in whose health improves
(i.e., the respondent or the dependent) as a result of the policy. Thus the design makes

23

explicit an issue that often goes unstated in traditional stated preference applications—the
nature of dependency relationships among household members. If the nature of these
relationships is unimportant, then there will be no differences across responses based
merely on a difference in the identity of the hypothetical family member receiving care.
We conduct two types of non-parametric tests. Our first involves testing for
differences in the response pattern for the “self” question and the “hypothetical
dependent” question. For each such test, we first split the sample according to the
hypothetical dependent question received by each respondent (i.e., child, teen, or older
adult). Then we create categorical variables based on the sequence of responses, one
variable for each choice question. Each categorical variable takes the value of one, two,
three, or four based on a response sequence of yes/yes, yes/no, no/yes, or no/no
respectively. Because responses to these questions are dependent (each respondent
provides two of the categorical variables), we conduct McNemar tests. Separate tests are
performed for “self” versus “child”, “self” versus “teen”, and “self” versus “older adult.”
Our second set compares response patterns across all four types of questions,
“self,” “child,” “teen,” and “older adult.” To do so, the data are pooled so that each
respondent is represented twice. We conduct non-parametric χ 2 tests assuming
independence of the responses for a given respondent. Features of our survey design
including question order, bid levels, and the magnitude of the time savings could impact
these findings. However, since all of these attributes are constant for a given respondent,
they do not impact the McNemar tests.
While the non-parametric tests avoid the need to make specific assumptions about
the choice model, they do not control for respondent characteristics, such as family size

24

and experience with asthma, that may lead to the observed differences in response
patterns. Our parametric model, an interval regression model that uses the responses to
the choice questions asked of each respondent to form the intervals, allows us to account
for this heterogeneity. To illustrate the logic, let WTPic represent respondent i’s latent
willingness to pay for the proposed policy change that affects the required care-giving
time devoted to individual c where c denotes child, teen, older adult, or the respondent
himself. WTPic is not observed by the analyst. Instead, the analyst observes two choices.
These responses lead to the bounds. Thus if b1i and b2i represent the initial and followup bids respectively presented to respondent i, then :
(i) WTPic ≥ b2i if respondent chooses yes for both questions;
(ii) WTPic < b2i if respondent chooses no for both questions;
(iii) b1i ≤ WTPic < b2i if respondent chooses yes for the first question and no for
the follow-up;
(iv) b2i ≤ WTPic < b1i if respondent chooses no for the first question and yes for
the follow-up.
Initial bids vary randomly across respondents and follow-up bids depend, as we described
earlier, on responses to the initial bid such that b2i = 2b1i if the response to the initial bid
is yes and b2i = 12 b1i if the initial bid receives a response of no.
The interval-censored (iii and iv), right-censored (i) and left-censored (ii) data that
result from our interpretation of the responses suggest likelihood contributions for each

25

respondent based on his sequence of responses.13 In estimating our proposed parametric
models, we pool all responses so that each respondent makes two contributions to the
likelihood function, one based on each double-bounded dichotomous choice question he
answers.14 Our basic empirical model assumes the latent WTP can be represented as
follows:
WTPic = β 0 + β1 ni + β 2 ΔLi + β 5 ci + β 6 mi + β 7 xi + ε i .

(21)

where ni represents the number of household members in respondent i’s household, ΔLi
denotes the change in required care-giving time, ci is the identity of the individual
receiving care, mi is respondent i’s household income, and xi is a vector of other
variables hypothesized to affect WTP. The β s are parameters to be estimated and ε i
represents an error term.
Our conceptual model suggests that if respondents’ choices are consistent with the
underlying WTP described by equation (11), which results from the collective model, and
a specific assumption about how respondents account for income reallocation, then we
expect household income to be a significant factor in our parametric models. An
insignificant coefficient on mi would be inconsistent with this underlying (collective)
WTP measure.15 Note that in this parsimonious model we do not allow for interactions

13

We use the intreg command in Stata 10.0SE to estimate these models. See Stewart [1983] for a
description of interval regression and the associated maximum likelihood estimator.
14
This analysis does not account for the correlation among responses that arises because each respondent
contributes two responses to the parametric analysis. We use a robust covariance matrix for the estimated
standard errors. This estimator corresponds to Stata’s implementation of the Huber sandwich estimator for
the interval regression model. This procedure offers an asymptotically consistent estimate for the effects of
the selection term in the model but it does not fully address the correlation induced by correlation across
the two questions asked of each respondent.
15
Note that an insignificant coefficient on income would not permit us to distinguish between those WTP
measures described in equations (15) and (20) and the WTP measure that would arise from a unitary model.

26

between household income and other factors such as ci . Variations on this basic
specification are discussed below.
The multiple-stage nature of KN’s sampling procedures raises concerns of
potential sample selection bias. Our data permit us to investigate this possibility for the
final stage of the sampling procedure. To be specific, we can distinguish among those
individuals who were invited to participate in our survey and chose not to (or failed to
complete the survey) and those individuals represented in the final sample used in our
parametric model. To formally correct for potential bias resulting from sample selection,
we adopt a variant of Heckman’s [1979] two-step procedure. First, we estimate a probit
selection model where we hypothesize that selection into our sample depends on factors
such as gender, race, education, employment status and income. Then, we use
predictions from this model to form the inverse Mills ratio for each respondent and
include this factor as an independent variable in our interval regression models.
As noted earlier, 2,110 of the 2,670 Knowledge Network panelists invited to
participate did so. Thirteen observations had missing values for key variables and were
subsequently dropped from the analysis. Table 1 summarizes the sample characteristics
of the remaining 2,097 respondents included in the regression analyses described below.
Fifty-one percent of respondents were female and the average age of respondents in our
sample was 47 years. Almost one-third of respondents (31%) graduated from high school
and 17% graduated from college. The majority of respondents (71%) identified
themselves as white, while 11% and 12% reported that they were black or Hispanic,
respectively.

27

While household size ranged from one to nine persons, most households were
fairly small. Fifty-nine percent had 2 members or less (77% had 3 members or less and
91% had 4 members or less), and the average household size was 2.58 persons. Twentythree percent of respondents were from households with only one adult aged 18 or older;
55% were from households with 2 adults; and 22% of households had more than 2 adults.
One percent of households had at least one child under two years old; ten percent had at
least one child aged 2 through 5; fourteen percent had at least one child aged 6-12 years;
and twelve percent had at least one child between 13 and 17 years.
Most households represented by respondents in the sample own their own home
(68%) and average annual household income was $52,872. Thirty-two percent of
households earned $27,500 or less; 35% earned between $27,500 and $55,000; 27%
earned between $55,000 and $112,500; and only 5% earned more than $112,500. Fiftyfive percent of respondents were from dual income households and the majority worked
full-time (60%). Seventeen percent of respondents were retired; 4% were unemployed;
and 6% were disabled.
Table 2 indicates the patterns of respondent support for family members. Overall,
about 47% of respondents indicated providing support in the form of time or money to at
least one child, teen, or older adult; 30% of respondents indicated providing such support
to a child, 16% to a teen, and 14% to an older adult. Within a given age category, the
percent of respondents providing financial support and providing time support was fairly
consistent except for the 18-55 and 63 years plus age categories. Nearly twice as many
respondents provided financial support to adults aged 18 to 55 (17.5%) as provided time
support (9.5%). Conversely, more respondents provided time support to older adults 63

28

years or older (9.6%) than provided financial support (6.2%). Of those respondents who
indicated providing care for a family member, between 11 and 20 percent of those
receiving care had been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma prevalence was slightly higher
among adults receiving care.
Table 3 presents the results of one of three McNemar tests. The results presented
in the table indicate significant differences between the response pattern for the “self”
question and the response pattern for the “child” question (p-value = 0.00).16 We also
find significant differences between the “self” question and the “teen” question (p-value
= 0.003; results not shown). However, the tests suggest no significant differences
between the “self” question and the “older adult” question (p-value = 0.213; results not
shown). Our second set of tests involve pooling the data and forming categorical
variables based on the double-bounded responses for the different scenarios. We reject
equivalence of the distributions of these variables, which suggests that dependency
matters, provided the effect does not vary with the level of the WTP. This is further
evidence of the potential importance of different types of dependency relationships.
Table 4 presents the results of our parametric analysis. The second column
presents the results of the parsimonious model described in equation (21). First, we
discuss the results with respect to measures of household income which, as discussed
above permit a test of the collective model as represented in equation (11). We include
four household income variables, “income1” through “income4,” derived from a
categorical household income variable (with 18 categories) provided by KN. Our
household income variables allow the marginal effect of income to vary based on
The χ distribution is generally used to evaluate the McNemar test statistic as it provides an
approximation of the exact sampling distribution, the binomial distribution [Sheskin, 2000].

household income class. They are created by interacting four dummy variables
representing household income classes (less than $27,500; between $27,500 and $55,000;
between $55,000 and $112,500; greater than $112,500) with a measure of estimated
actual household income. Actual income levels were estimated by taking the midpoint of
the 18 income intervals and then using a Pareto tail approximation to assign a point value
for the open upper interval. The income classes assign approximately equal numbers of
respondents to the first three groups. We investigated the correspondence of the groups
to approximate income tax rates using Stata’s marginal tax rate computation scheme.
The lowest interval would be consistent with two marginal tax rates, the highest of which
overlaps with the second income interval. The other two intervals have the same
marginal tax rate. Three of the four income variables are positive and significant while
“income1” is insignificant. However, the four variables taken as a group are jointly
significantly different from zero (p-value = 0.00). These results suggest that respondents’
choices are inconsistent with the unitary model.17
Other variables suggested by equation (21) include household size, which is
negative and significant as expected, and the proposed reduction in care-giving time.
Because the change in care-giving time takes only two values, we create a dummy
variable, denoted “low time,” which equals one if the response was based on the small
reduction in care-giving time (from three hours to one hour) and zero if the large
reduction (from eight hours to one hour) was assigned. As expected, a smaller reduction
in the required care-giving time reduces willingness to pay. However, the effect is not
significant at conventional levels (p-value = 0.134). To gauge the effect of familiarity

17

We also estimated an alternative specification in which we replace our four income measures with a
single measure of household income. The coefficient on this variable was positive and highly significant.

30

with asthma we include a dummy variable indicating whether or not the respondent or a
family member had ever been diagnosed with asthma (based on the respondent’s self
report). As anticipated, the coefficient on this variable is positive and significant.
We use a set of dummy variables, “child question”, “teen question”, and “older
adult question” to indicate the hypothetical household member associated with each
response. The excluded category is the respondent himself. Inclusion of this set of
dummy variables allows us to further examine the importance of dependency
relationships among household members. The coefficients on these terms suggest that
estimated WTP is higher for hypothetical changes that affect the dependent child’s or
teen’s health relative to changes that affect the respondent’s own health. However, there
is no significant difference between responses based on older adult and self questions.
Pair-wise hypothesis tests suggest significant differences between child and older adult
(p-value = 0.000), and teen and older adult (p-value = 0.014) but no significant
differences between child and teen (p-value = 0.253). These results are consistent with
our non-parametric results and suggest important effects of different hypothetical
dependency relationships.
The variable “current care-giver” allows an examination of the effects of existing
dependency relationships on respondents’ choices. Its coefficient is positive and
(marginally) significant as expected. In order to further explore current relationships
among household members that may impact respondents’ choices, we include a variable
indicating whether or not the respondent indicated belonging to a dual-income household.
This variable is negative and (marginally) significant. This result may suggest

31

differences in the perceived reallocation of income resulting from the policy change
between respondents in dual-income households and those in single-income households.
We include two variables in addition to those suggested by (21). The first
variable, denoted “question1st,” controls for possible ordering effects. This variable
takes a value of one if the question associated with an observation came first in the
survey and zero if the question came second. The negative and significant coefficient on
this term indicates significant ordering effects that reduce WTP estimates for those
responses based on first questions. The second variable represents a selection control
resulting from the probit model of sample selection described above. Based on the
results of this model, we compute the inverse Mills ratio for each respondent and include
this as an independent variable in our WTP equations. The results of the selection model
suggest that, relative to invited KN panelists who chose not to participate, respondents
represented in our sample are older, from lower income households, and are more likely
to be white and male.18 The positive and significant coefficient on the inverse Mills ratio
suggests significant selection effects. As we have seen above, neither the ordering nor
selection effects confound our ability to test for the importance of different dependency
relationships.
While the parsimonious model does not allow for interaction variables, our
conceptual model, equation (11) in particular, does not preclude the possibility that
interaction variables will be important in explaining differences in respondents’ choices.
Our second specification explores these effects by augmenting the first specification with
various household income interaction terms. To be specific, we investigate whether the
effect of differences in the age of the hypothetical household member receiving care on
18

Full results of the selection model are available by request from the authors.

32

respondents’ choices will vary with income. To do so, we create a set of 12 interaction
variables among our household income variables, “income1” through “income4”, and our
three dummy variables identifying the hypothetical dependent as child, teen, or older
adult. We do not report the coefficients on these variables because, taken individually,
they are of limited interest. However, using combinations of the estimated coefficients
on these interaction terms and non-interacted variables, we can test for differences in
WTP estimates for child, teen, older adult, and self within various income classes. The
third column of Table 4 reports the results of our second parametric specification. Note
that with the inclusion of interaction terms, the interpretation of the coefficients on the
income terms as well of those variables indicating question type varies between the two
specifications. In the second specification, these coefficients cannot be interpreted
independently as in the first specification.
The results of pair-wise hypothesis tests of differences in estimated WTP by
hypothetical family member for different income classes are reported in Table 5. The
results of these tests suggest estimated WTP is higher for the child question relative to the
older adult question for three of the four income classes. We also find differences
between estimated WTP for the child and self questions although the results vary with
income class. Overall, the tests suggest that WTP estimates based on observed choices of
those respondents in the highest income class do not seem to vary with the nature of the
hypothesized dependency relationships. However, these distinctions become important at
lower income classes.

33

V. Implications

The protocol used to set ambient standards for the criteria air pollutants focuses
on the expected impact of each pollutant on a sensitive group. The standard is selected to
protect an average member of that group under the premise that doing so will also protect
all other, less sensitive, individuals. To the extent these sensitive individuals are cared
for by other household members, benefit estimates should reflect these dependencies and
how they might change in response to policies changes.
The recent findings of Bateman and Munro [2009] and Lindhjem and Navrud
[2009] confirm that adult decision makers in a given household react differently to the
same choice situation. This is true even when they are asked to answer for the household.
A framework that accounts for variation in care-giving responsibilities across household
members may help to explain these differences. Our analysis takes a first step at
exploring how we might learn more about the relationship between dependency and
choice.
We derive three expressions for WTP that imply a test for whether respondents
consider household budget re-allocations when answering stated choice questions. We
design a survey to focus a respondent’s attention on a hypothetical dependent. We find
that choices display properties that are inconsistent with a unitary model. Moreover,
respondent’s choices vary with the type of dependency. They also vary with the level of
household income. This latter effect would not be present with a unitary model. The
stated preference responses also display patterns that are consistent with treating them as
situations the respondent took seriously. One indicator supporting this judgment is that a
respondent’s past experience with asthma and with care-giving influenced the decisions

34

he made. The observed response patterns also underscore the difficulty in using multiple
stated preference questions in a single survey. Our empirical analysis suggests
significant ordering effects. We find a significant selection effect for the Internet panel
members who agreed to take the survey. However, these effects do not appear to
influence our primary conclusions.
While our findings are encouraging, we believe several steps remain before it will
be possible to frame stated preference questions that elicit household preferences in ways
that allow identification of the budget allocation and choice processes. First, we need to
consider the alignment between choices related to hypothetical versus real dependency
relationships. Second, we require an improved understanding of how individuals
evaluate the effects of policies that influence time or financial resources available to the
household and internal reallocation activities. Finally, we need a clear method for asking
who among household members participates in these reallocation decisions.
