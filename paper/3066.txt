In this paper we demonstrate that exchange rate regime switching is compatible

with optimal government policies.        Nominal exchange-rate regimes are

formalized as equilibrium commitments on future seigniorage policies, and the

collapse of an exchange-rate peg as an excusable default which allows the

government to lump-sum tax private sector money holdings. We demonstrate that

a regime in which the exchange-rate peg is allowed to collapse when government

spending is unusually high is a trigger-strategy equilibrium. Such a regime

can be superior to both fixed and flexible exchange rate because it combines

some of the flexibility of the floating exchange rates with some of the

benefits of precommitment afforded by fixed rates.

1.   Introduction

     Several recent studies have analyzed the properties of alternative

exchange rate regimes. York begun in papers by Kelpman and Razin [1979] and

Relp'uan fl981 compared the welfare levels achievable under a fullyflexible

and a fixed exchange rate system.       The authors showed that, in a highly

simplified environment, the choice of the exchange system is irrelevant in the

sense that the individual opportunity set is invariant across alternative

exchange rate arrangements. This neutrality property tends to break down when

richer analytical models are considered.      For example, Helpman and Razin

[1982]   and Aschauer and Greenwood [1983] discuss cases in which a flexible
exchange rate regime is superior to a fixed exchange rate regime. In general,

however, it is difficult to provide an unambiguous ranking. Another line of

research, initiated by Krugman [1987], Flood and Garber [1989], and Froot and

Obstfeld [1989] ,   has concentrated on the properties of a band-type system.

But these studies have focused on the exchange rate stabilization effect of

this type of system and not strictly on its welfare implications.

     These analyses are conducted under the implicit assumption that a country

makes an irrevocable decision to operate under one particular system. There

is ample evidence, however, that policy makers "change their minds." It is

not rare, in fact, to observe a country abandoning a fixed exchange rate or

moving from free floating to some form of exchange rate control.      The past

hundred years of financial history have been characterized by switches from

fixed exchange arrangements (e.g. Gold Standard, Gold-Exchange Standard,

Bretton-Voods) to flexible exchange rate regimes (the ihterwar flexible

periods and the post-1972 floating period). A more recent system like the EMS

can be interpreted as a mixture of fixed and flexible regimes: usually the
exchange rate is pegged around its official central parity, but sometimes it

is left to drift away from the parity, and at other times the parity itself is

changed.

     The existence of switches between fixed and flexible exchange rates has

long been recognized and has been the subject of a consistent body of

research.    Starting with Salant and Henderson [1978] and Krugman [1979]

several papers have been written on the topic of speculative attacks and

collapses of fixed exchange rates. In most of this literature, however, these

switches are seen as the result of incompatible monetary and exchange rate

policies ,   thus ruling out any rationale for this type of occurrence.
Moreover, while much attention has been devoted to the forced abandonment of

the fixed exchange rate, a similar effort has not been made to understand the

welfare consequences of speculative attacks or the motives that would lead the

authorities to fix the exchange rate. In fact, most of the speculative attack

literature offers no justification for fixed exchange rate policies.

     In this paper we show that exchange rate collapses may be consistent with

optimal policies. Ve illustrate how superficially inconsistent policies--in

this instance monetary growth that is incompatible with a previously announced

fixed exchange rate--can be understood as part of a more complex regime in

which the policy maker in well-defined circumstances is allowed an excusable

default on the commitment to a fixed exchange rate. The analysis is based on

a model in which policy makers use distortionary income taxation and

seigniorage to finance an exogenously given expenditure stream.        The policy

maker has an incentive to generate surprise inflation to lump-sum tax money

balances and, unless she can precommit future inflation, the equilibrium of

the model is inefficient. flowever, as Barro and Gordon [l983a,b] have shown,

an equilibrium superior to the time-consistent one can be implemented if the
                                                                  3




policy maker cares sufficiently about future outcomes and   the   private sector

"punishes" her for surprise inflation by losing confidence in her resolve not

to generate inflation surprises in the future. In this case, the inefficiency

of future equilibria that would result if the private sector loses confidence

deters the policy maker from generating surprise inflation.             Bowever,

deterrence may not be sufficient to prevent surprise inflation in all states

of nature. As &otemberg and Saloner [1986] have shown in the context of an

oligopoly example, there may exist other types of equilibria in which

temporary breakdowns of cooperation (i.e. when deterrence is insufficient) do

not preclude cooperation in other statest.   The collapse of an exchange rate

peg may be understood in exactly this way, as an excusable default on ,a

commitment to a fixed rate that allows the policy maker to meet unusually

large government spending by generating unexpected inflation, that is, by

imposing a lump-sum tax on money balances. Support for this interpretation

can be found in Figure 1, which reveals that historically the collapse of

fixed exchange rate regimes coincided with periods of sudden rises in

government expenditures while the return to pegged exchange rates has

coincided with the return of expenditure to nornal levels. In this figure, we

plot both seigniorage and government expenditure (both as a fraction of

domestic product) of the United Kingdom2.       Unshaded areas correspond to

periods in which the exchange rate was officially pegged.      The association

between expenditure levels and the exchange rate system is quite striking.

     The plan of the paper is as follows.      The next section discusses and

motivates a simple model of optimal seigniorage.      In sections 3 and 4 the

    model is used to analyze the welfare properties of alternative exchange-rate

    regimes and to demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium regime that allows

    for the collapse and refixing of the exchange rate. Finally, the concluding

    section summarizes the results and discusses possible further research.



    2.   The lodel

         The model is designed to highlight the constraints on government

    financial policies imposed by alternative exchange rate regimes.        Thus, we

    assume a small open economy that takes world prices and interest rates as

    given.
               Vorld prices and interest rates are assumed to be constant and

    domestic and foreign goods to be perfect substitutes.               Consequently,

    purchasing power parity holds and government seigniorage policy is the crucial

    determinant of nominal exchange-rate behavior, since the rate of exchange

    depreciation equals the domestic rate of inflation,



                s-s
                 t  i-I
                          =
                              t         t-J   =1   +
    (2.1)
                  t-1             t-i



    where      is the exchange rate (domestic currency price of foreign currency),

    Ft is the domestic price level, and rj the inflation rate. The analysis

    focuses on the decision problem of a policy maker who seeks to minimize the

    cost of financing an exogenous stream of real government expenditure, {}7O

    We implicitly assume a private sector whose members have rational expectations

—   and whose demand for real money balances depends on expected inflation.

            The analysis is simplified considerably by taking C to be the
    government's revenue requirement after transactions in government bonds and

    foreign exchange. Thus, the policy maker chooses tax and money financing to
                                                                           3




    satisfy the government budget constraint,




    (2.2)       Q =     +




    where       and I are tax revenues and the nominal stock of high powered money
    outstanding.      By pushing government borrowing and reserve use into the

    background, we are able to focus more clearly on the long-run factors

    underlying exchange-rate regime switches, illustrated in figure 1, although we

    thereby preclude the analysis of the short-run dynamics of the transition from

    one regime to another.3

            Ye normalize government budget constraint by expressing variables as

    ratios to CliP,




    (2.3) gtn;t*st


    where       is the rate of government spending out of CliP, r is the average

    income tax rate, and       is seigniorage revenues relative to CliP.       To simplify

    the exposition we assume s to be a linear function of anticipated and

    unanticipated inflation,




    (2.4) s c1(r1 -         r1)   +
                                      c2r1   ,
                                                        c1,   c2 > 0



    where        =          is the expected rate of inflation between period t-! and
-

    period t, and        is the actual rate of inflation from period t-l to period



    3 Transitions as analyzed in the speculative attack literature are not
    inconsistent with our model. In fact, we consider our analysis to be
    complementary to that literature.

and          denotes an expectation conditional on information available in period

t.    Here c2 is meant to capture the revenue from the distortionary taxation on

money holdings associated with expected inflation, and c1 the revenue from the

lump-sum taxation of nominal government liabilities associated with surprise

inflation.            Note that by restricting c2 to exceed zero, we are implicitly

assuming the inflation-tax Laffer curve to be upward sloping at rates of

inflation relevant to our analysis. We shall also assume that the parameters

      and         remain constant across the different exchange rate regimes that we

analyze.

       The cost of financing government expenditures has four components: the

excess burden of income taxes, the liquidity cost of (smaller money holdings

arising from) anticipated inflation, the menu costs of actual inflation, and

the cost of resource misallocation resulting from unanticipated inflation. A

simple loss function capturing these costs is assumed for the policy maker in

period i,

where       fi   ,0   <   fi    I ,   is   the policy maker's discount factor, and           will be

referred to as a one-period loss function. This loss function can be viewed

as capturing, approximately, costs borne by a representative individual. Note

also that the liquidity costs in period t depend on expected inflation from

that period to the next, r , although it would not be possible for a policy

maker who cannot precommit future policies to influence these expectations
                                                                  7




directly.

       Finally, it is assumed that the government spending rate out of GNP is

serially independent, with mean g and variance ?,    and has bounded support

!' ]' with 0< g <        < t.
       Tn the absence of mechanisms that enable policy makers to precommit

future policies credibly, the equilibrium of the model is inefficient.         The

source     of the inefficiency is well known from the literature on

time-consistent monetary policy (lydland and Prescott [1977], Calvo [1978a,

b]):     from the policy maker's point of view, private sector real money

holdings (or expectations of inflation) at the end of the preceding period are

given. This creates an incentive to impose a capital levy on money balances

through unanticipated inflation. Private agents recognize this incentive and

choose real money holdings small enough to eliminate it. As a result, the

equilibrium is characterized by an average inflation rate exceeding that which

a policy maker who can preconunit to a fixed rate of inflation would choose.

In other words, the economy can be said to have an inflation bias stemming

from a precommitment externality.

       In this paper a nominal exchange-rate regime is viewed as a commitment to

a set of future seigniorage policies. Such a commitment, if credible, enables

the policy maker to fix private sector expectations. The exchange rate is a

convenient indicator of government policies.       It is responsive to policy

changes and widely observed and, therefore, easy for private agents to
monitor.    Thus, it is reasonable to "write" an implicit social contract on

seigniorage in terms of the exchange rate, even if such a contract need not be

particularly simple.

        A permanent exchange-rate peg can be viewed as a commitment on the part
of    government never to use the seigniorage tax.              It   enables the policy maker

to fix private sector expectations of inflation at the cost of giving up the

use of seigniorage altogether. A free float, on the other hand, allows the

policy makef the flexibility to adjust income tax rates and inflation in

response to government spending. As a simple way of capturing the potential

cot of mànetary independence, we assume that under a float the policy maker

cannot precomnit, that is, the equilibrium is the Nash equilibrium of the

seigniorage pOlicy game.

            Under a permanent float, the policy maker in each period chooses the

income tax rate and inflation rate so as to minimize the cost of taxation,

taking as given government spending and private sector real money holdings.

Because current policy actions do not affect future outcomes, the policy maker

in period i solves the single-period optimization problem,

The costs of floating are increasing in the average government spending rate

(or revenue requirement) because high average spending implies a high expected

inflation rate in a float.                   On the other band, the benefits of a flexible

exchange rate regimes are increasing in the variance of the government

Thus, a float is more desirable the greater the revenue from fully anticipated

inflation (a2), the smaller the liquidity cost of inflation relative to its

direct cost (a2 -               and the greater the revenue from surprise inflation
                         a1),
relative to that from fully anticipated inflation (a2- a2).               Intuitively,

(a2-a1) and (a1 - a2) are measures of the cost of the policy maker's inability

to precommit inflation: the greater (a2 -         a1), the smaller the cost entailed
by the policy maker's inability to take into account the effect of his

anticipated actions on real money holdings in the preceding period; and the

greater (a -             the greater the incentive to generate surprise inflation
                  a2),
and hence the higher the equilibrium inflation rate in the time-coosistent

equilibrium. Note also that if there is no excess burden of income taxation,

a4 =   0, the   two regimes are equivalent. This can be seen from eqs. (2.3) aod

(3.5), which indicate that                 =   0 and   that     =         if   a4

       It   is clear, howevet, that a pegged exchange rate, even if preferable to

a float on average, need not be preferred in all states of nature.

Specifically, suppose that, if the policy maker resorts to unanticipated

inflation (a devaluation of the domestic currency), private agents would lose

confidence in the exchange rate peg forever and expect the policy maker to use

discretionary seigniorage in all subsequent periods. Even if this "punishment

mechanism" exists, the policy maker may have an incentive to generate an

inflation surprise          in periods with extraordinarily high government

expenditures:       The incentive to reduce the cost of income taxation at

extraordinarily high rates may outweigh the cost of being in a floating rate

regime afterwards.

4.     Endogenoma Exchange late legime Switching
       In   this section we demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium exchange

rate   regime in which transitions between fixed and floating exchange rates are

endogenous.      In this regime the commitment to the exchange rate peg is

understood to be a contingent one. The public knows that the government will,

in well-defined circumstances, break its commitment to the simple exchange

rate peg and loses confidence in the policy maker only if he resorts to the

discretionary use of seigniorage outside these circumstances. Such a mixed or

adjustable peg regime allows the government to trade off an inefficient

average inflation rate for the ability to "lump sum"5 tax money balances when

government     spending is unusually high; it dominates the polar extremes of
permanently fixed and freely flexible exchange rates for a large subset of

possible values of the parameters of the model.

       A fixed exchange rate that is subject to collapse wben government

spending is unusually high can be formalized as a trigger-strategy equilibrium

of the seigniorage policy game that we have outlined:          Under fairly general

conditions, there exists a trigger government spending rate out of GNP, g

such that the government will maintain the exchange rate peg when the actual

spending rate, g ,     falls   short of 9* and will collapse the exchange rate by

resorting to unanticipated inflation when          >   g   .   The private sector,

recognizing the policy maker's incentives, will punish the government by

losing confidence in the exchange-rate regime (playing Nash) forever only if
                                                                               *
the government uses discretionary seigniorage at spending rates below g

   Properly speaking, unanticipated inflation is not a lump- sum tax in this
model. In fact, we have assumed that unanticipated inflation is
distortionary, because of its redistributive effects (that is, a3 ' 0).
Still, since agents cannot preemptively reduce their money holdings when
inflation is unexpected, unanticipated inflation does not have liquidity
costs. It is in this sense that it has elements of a lump-sum tax.
                                                                                      14




Formally,    the equilibrium trigger is defined as follows.                          Let BC(g
denote the benefit, and C (g )                   the cost, of collapsing the exchange rate peg
when it is not justified--an action that we will refer to as the policy maker

'reneging"     dii   the      commitment to the exchange rate regime.                       Then the
                                  *
equilibrium   trigger, g ,             satisfies       one of the following three conditions:




             t(g,g) =                 C'(g   ,
                                                 and

(4.1)        Bc(U,Y ) > C(2 )              , Yj    > g , and

             B°(g,g) < Cc(g)                       <




                =    g   if BC(g,)           <             for all        [g ,
(42)




                =        [f   Bt(g,g) > CC(g), for all                e      '




Eq.     (4.1) defines the equilibrium for an adjustable peg regime, that is the
                              -                              *
case where g < g c g. It states that g is the highest government spending

rate at which the private sector's los of confidence can deter the policy

maker from setting the exchange rate afloat and generating surprise inflation.

A permanent peg corresponds to an equilibrium trigger equal to g.                           According

to (4.2) it is an equilibrium exchange-rate regime if the cost of collapsing

exceeds the benefits at all possible values of                              when the private agents

expect the government to maintain the peg forever.                               Similarly, eq. (4.3)

states that a permanent float is an equilibrium when the policy maker never

has an incentive to peg the rate if the private agents expect her mat to do

so.
                                                                   15




        In the case analyzed before, the policy maker made a once and for all

 choice of exchange-rate regime. Nov we consider a situation where the policy

maker in each period decides whether to maintain the exchange-rate regime or

to renege. In this situation, the policy maker's present actions affect the

exchange-rate regime and hence losses from next period onwards. For ease of

exposition,        we shall compare the benefit of reneging on the mixed

exchange-rate regime (which are reaped in the current period), with the costs

(which are borne in the future). This allows us to treat the policy maker's

choice in parallel fashion with the analysis up to now.



4.1 Existence of an Equilibrium Trigger

        To illustrate the conditions for existence of an equilibrium trigger, we

consider the benefits and costs of collapsing the exchange rate peg when it is

not justified, that is, when           <

        Consider first the benefits from reneging on the mixed exchange rate

regime. Benefits arise only in the current period, and are given by



(4.4)       3C(9      9*1 9t< 9 )      L(g, 9   I i<   ) - L(9,    g    I   c< 9

where £'(9j, 9* 9< g ) denotes the policy maker's one-period loss function
if the exchange rate is kept fixed, and            g   g< g ) is   the one-period

loss uujctio if the exchange rate is collapsed. Note that both L(g,

and ttt' g ) depend on the value of the trigger; the reason is that private
agenU' expectations of inflation in a mixed regime depend on g              ,   as the
           *
notation   r(g )   will   emphasize.

    The cost of collapsing the exchangerate peg when it is not Justified

equals the discounted cost of being in a floating rate regime rather than a

where I' and     are the policymaker's minimized loss functions under floating

The cost of reneging on the exchange rate regime equals the discounted cost of

being in a floating regime forever, adjusted by the cost of having a non-zero

expected rate of inflation under pegging, plus the cost of forgoing the

ability to engineer excusable exchange-rate collapses under a mixed regime.

Details of the derivation and the exact expressions for both

çC(g ), and 1 (g )       are given in the Appendix.
        To simplify the notation, ye use (9j9t) to denote the net benefit of

                                                                             as follows. If for a

given pt there is a value of                that equates the implied costs and benefits of

reneging on the exchange rate regime, the trigger function picks out this
                              7                                                  *
value, denoted by p               ,   as a candidate trigger.         If for p the costs of
reneging on the exchange rate regime exceed the benefits (#(gg'Pt) c 0) for

all g, the trigger function picks ,                 that    is a permanent peg.           Finally, it

logically picks a permanent float as a candidate equilibrium if the benefits

of reneging exceed the costs at all possible values of p. An equilibrium

trigger is a fixed point of the "trigger function" map, that is, a p

satisfying

as illustrated in figure 2.               Thus, to prove the existence of an equilibrium

adjustable peg exchange rate regime, we have to show that p (p )
                                                                               7*         continuously
maps the [p ,         7] interval        into itself.        For the regime to include the

possibility of occasional collapses, however, the fixed point of the trigger

function should occur in the interior of [p,7] .                Noifetheless, to establish the
existence of an interior fixed point, is important to cbaracteri2e what

happens at the boundaries of the support of                         This is the purpose of the

following two lemmas.
       Lemma 4.2: g is an equilibrium trigger.
                                        *
       Proof: Recall that when g                g a mixed regime is equivalent to a

permanent float. Therefore, from (4.5) we obtain that c°(g) =                    0.    Front the
                                                                          —
expressions (A.11) for B°(g,g) it can be shown that:



                    =
(4.15)                  ll°(g,g)
                    =                                                     -
                        (a    +

that   is               >   C°(g)    0 at all values of g, as shown in figure 3(a).

Therefore, by (4.13), gf(g*) =
                                            I

       Intuitively,         the policy maker     will   always prefer to choose

optimally, since reneging is costless when the exchange rate is expected to

float forever from the next period onwards.               As a corollary of lemma 4.2

notice that, since (g,gt) is continuous in                and   gt,    (g,gt) )       0 V     for

g to the neighborhood of g.
       Similarly,



       Lemma 4.3:       If a permanent peg is time consistent, j is an equilibrium

trigger.

       Proof: By definition, a permanent peg is time consistent if                            c 0,

or B°(g,) < CC(j), for all                  as shown in figure 3(b).          Thus, by (4.13),
                                                                                                 -

     Before proving the existence of an interior equilibrium trigger is

convenient to prove the following two results:



     Lenuna 4.4: If a permanent peg is time consistent, the cost of an

unjustified collapse is globally increasing in the trigger spending rate.
                                                       V
     Proof:       Note, first, that when g = g, a mixed regime is equivalent to a

permanent peg, and thus L(g 'j) = L9.                            Consequently, (4.5) reduces to

=         -    C°), which is positive because a permanent peg, to be time
consistent, must be superior to a permanent float, that is I                                        > ii',    Recalling

from Lemma 4.2 that C'(g) = 0, we obtain C'()                              ' ff(9)      = 0.


     Lemma 4.5:          The benefit of an unjustified collapse is monotonically

decreasing in the trigger spending rate, that is, Ot/Dg* <                                     0.

Condition     (4.11) guarantees that r'(g), and thus oBC/8g ,                           are   negative.



       We are now in the position to prove the following proposition which

establishes the existence of an equilibrium mixed exchange-rate regiin.



       Pronosition 4.1:                If a permanent peg is incentive compatible, there
                                              *                *   —
exists   an equilibrium trigger, g                   ,   such that g < g       <   g.


       Proof: We have to show that there always is a closed subset of [g ,                                           lg],
            such that gT(g) continuously maps [g1,g2J into [g ,9] .                                         Recall

that, by Lemma 4.5, t(9L,9 )                    is    monotonically decreasing in g .                  If       C(g

were monotonically increasing in p ,                          the proof of the existence of a fixed

point would be straightforward.                      In this case, in fact, we could define an

interval [111,92J    (g       <
                                   g<       g2< g) such that (g 'ii) = 0 and                           '2 =
Therefore, p7(g) =                fo:                and 1'() =          for            g. F:r all values

of p     such that g< p < 9 , p                           (p )      is   defined by *( ,g          )    0.            By

continuity of *(s4) p7(p) continuously maps                                                   into [p       ,




loreover,     because of the monotonicity of t(g,g') and C0(p), also 7(g*) is

monotonic, which guarantees the uniqueness of the (interior) fixed point. The
                        *
                                  is       not guaranteed, however. In this case, p (p )
                                                                                                       7*        need

existence of at least one interior fixed point can be proved, following the

same type of argument used above. The reason why this is true can be seen by

considering a transition between the definition of p (p )
                                                                         7*       as   the solution to

(g7g*) =          0 and       =
                                     because *(gt,g*)             0 V g. Because nC(g,g)

monotonically increasing in                    and       C (p )    is   independent of g, such
                                                     =
transitions between always occur at                      p.     Similarly, transition between the

definition of p (p )          as    the solution to (p ,p )                 0 and p =          p because

Ø(g,p) <          0   V p always occur at 7 =              j.     Thus, since C(pt) is globally
increasing, see Lemma 4.4, it is always possible to define an interval [g1,p2]
                                                                                              •
such that g7(p) =          p, p7() =       and Ø(gt,g*)            U for Pj< P         Pp


     Figure 4(a) illustrates an example of p (p ).
                                                              7*        Lemma 4.2 established that

          >   0   V p. By continuity of *(c) p7(p*)                        p for :ome interval [g,

     as represented by the initial horizontal segment of p (p ).                            Analogously,
Lemma 4.3 established that (Pj'I)              <   0 V p, if a fixed exchange rate is time

consistent.           Fence, by continuity, p7(p') = p for some interval [sd' p] ,                         as

represented by the final horizontal segment of p (p ).

     In    this example it is assumed that the nonmonotonicity of CC(g)

produces an interior interval of                                        such that for p [pg]
              > 0 V p. Jumps in the value of p ,                  as shown at p in figure 4(b),

     Finally,          it should be emphasized that the conditions assumed are

sufficient but certainly not necessary for the existence of an equilibrium

mixed exchange rate regime. In particular, although Proposition 4.1 is based

on the assumption that a permanent peg is_time consistent, the examples in

section 5 will show that a mixed exchange rate regime may be an equilibrium
                                                                     24




even if a permanent peg is not incentive compatible. Figure 5 illustrates the

equilibrium in this case. Vhen a permanent peg is not time consistent, *(j,g)

>   0,   therefore g1(j) c j, as shown in the figure. lultiple equilibria arise

naturally in this case: both ,q           and g     are equilihrium trigger spending

rates.



4.2 Yelf are under an Adjustable Peg Regime



         An adjustable peg regime allows the policy maker the use of unanticipated

inflation, generally presumed to be a very efficient source of revenue, when

the government revenue requirement is unusually high. It does so at the cost

of an inefficiently high expected rate of inflation; costly inflation

expectations errors occur in periods when spending is low. In this section we

show that the benefits may outweigh the cost: an adjustable peg may dominate

both permanent peg and a permanent float, Ve take the trigger spending rate

as a parameter and show that under intuitively plausible conditions an
                              S
equilibrium     regime with g sufficiently close to g will dominate a permanent

peg. Since we still assume that the peg is time consistent, this also implies

that the mixed regime also dominates a free float.

         The minimized value of the policy maker's intertemporal loss function

under an adjustable peg is given by

5.     An Example

       Ve have shown that an equilibrium adjustable peg (or mixed) exchange rate

regime exists if a permanent peg is incentive compatible and that such a
                                                                                        *
regime may be snperior to both a permanent float and a permanent peg if p

happens to be close to .         It   is not clear, however, that the equilibrium

adjustable peg regime corresponding to a particular set of parameter values

would in fact dominate the polar extremes of pegged or freely floating

exchange rates. To address this issue we now turn to some numerical examples

that confirm the existence of equilibrium adjustable peg regimes that dominate

free floating and permanent pegs, not only when a permanent peg is credible

but also when it is not and even when free floating is superior to a permanent

peg.

       In the examples, we assume that government spending is uniformly

distributed, with upper and lower bounds equal to 65 percent and 5 percent of

GNP respectively. Thus the expected value of government spending equals 35

percent and it variance approximately 3 percent of GNP. The parameters of the

policy maker's loss function are as follows: a7 =          0.004, 2 = 0.005 and
       0.03. In other words, the marginal cost of income taxation is six times

the marginal liquidity cost and seven and a half times the marginal menu cost

of inflation for r       r. Finally, c is assumed to equal 0.08; unanticipated

inflation at 1 percent per period yields government revenue equal to 0.08

percent of GNP. Variations in c2, a and fi are used to generate the different
                                      —
examples.

       Figure   6 illustrates the existence of a welfare improving adjustable peg

when a permanent peg cannot be implemented [B0(j ,          )>           .   It   is based

on the assumption that, c2 =          0.06,   and fi   = 0.35   and a5 = 0.002.     Thus,
                                                                           27




unanticipated inflation is assumed not to be very costly (a5 c a1 c a2), as

would be the case if the indexation is widespread. The top panel shows the

equilibrium trigger spending rate as the intersection of the cost of reneging,

Ct(gt) , and the benefit of doing so when current government spending out of

CNP equals the trigger spending rate, 3 (g ,g )          .     There are two equilibria

at trigger spending rates equal to 0.205 and 0.435.                     These equilibria

correspond to the exchange rate being peg 26 percent and 64 percent of the

time under an adjustable peg regime, respectively. The bottom panel plots the

minimized values of the policy maker's loss function under alternative

exchange rate regimes against the trigger.         In this case a permanent peg is

superior to a free float, while an adjustable peg dominates the permanent peg

when the equilibrium trigger exceeds 0.265. Thus the adjustable peg regime

corresponding to the equilibrium trigger equal to 0.435 is superior to both
                                                                                           *
permanently fixed and freely floating exchange rates, while the one with •g
equal to 0.205 dominates a free float but not a permanent peg.

        The case in which a permanent peg is incentive-compatible is shown in

figure 7.    The figure is drawn assuming that c2        0.07, and fi   = 0.5   and

a3 = 0.03     --
                   unanticipated   inflation is costly as the same rate as income

taxation.      In this example the equilibrium mixed regime is unique and
                                             I
corresponds to an equilibrium trigger, g , equal to about 0.15. As the lower
panel      shows; it      dominates    a   permanent     peg    and a free            float.

        Finally, figure 8, which assumes c5 =    0.09,    and fi   = 0.5   and a3 = 0.002

illustrates a case in which a free float is superior to a permanent peg.

There are two equilibrium mixed regimes. Both dominate the polar extremes of

free floating and permanent pegging.         The equilibrium values of the trtgger

are 0.18 and 0.395. They correspond to regimes in which the exchange rate is

allowed to float 78 and 42.5 percent of the time, respectively.
                                                                28




     The results illustrated by these examples are surprisingly robust.     In

contrast with the theoretical analysis, the examples require few special

assumptions to generate equilibrium adjustable peg regimes that dominate free

floating and permanent pegs.



6.   Conclusions

     In this paper a simple model of of exchange rate determination was used

to interpret alternative nominal exchange-rate regimes as commitments on

future seigniorage policies.    Ye interpreted the abandonment of a fixed

exchange rate as an excusable default on the commitment to a particular set of

seigniorage policies which, in well defined situations, allows the government

to tax private sector money holdings by unanticipated inflation.     Thus, what

superficially appears to be inconsistent policies, can be viewed as part of a

more complex regime of state contingent policies that partially internalize

precommitment externalities by simple rules.       This arrangement allows the

policy maker some flexibility in states of nature when simple rules are not

incentive compatible.

     A simple model of optimal taxation was used to analyze three exchange

rate regimes: a permanent peg, a free float, and a mixed peg-floating regime.

A free float allows the policy maker revenue flexibility at the cost of lack

of precommitment of future inflation. -   It   is most desirable in the face of

considerable uncertainty about future government financing needs. A permanent

exchange rate peg, while avoiding precomniitment externalities, does so at the

expense of the government being unable to spread the excess burden of taxation

over taxes and seigniorage. Yhether a permanent peg would be preferred to a

free float depends on both the stochastic properties of government expenditure

and the parameters of the model.    Even if a permanent peg is preferred, ex
                                                               29




ante, to a free float, it way be impossible to implement it, because the

government may not have the necessary precommitment technology. In this case,

we show that a free float is not necessarily the only outcome. Ye demonstrate

that it is possible to support a mixed regime, that is an exchange rate peg

that sometime collapses in the face of large spending shocks, as a
trigger-strategy equilibrium. Ye also show, with simulation exercises, that

this mixed regime can be superior, from a welfare point of view, to either a

permanent float and a permanent peg (even if the permanent peg were incentive

compatible).

     Our purpose is to provide a framework capable of reconciling exchange

rate pegging and collapses with optimal government policies. The specifics of

the analysis, based on budgetary problems, is most directly applicable to the

experience of developing countries and of industrial countries in extremely

adverse circumstances, like wars. However, the idea of optimal exchange rate

regime switches is more general.      For example, one could obtain similar

results by assuming that the state variable triggering a regime switch is     the

real exchange rate, instead of government spending. This alternative approach

may be more appropriate in modeling the recent experience of EMS countries.

Notice that two different expected rates of inflation:                           and r(g) appear in

(A.i).     The policy maker takes into adcount that if he reneges, expected

inflation from the time of the collapse onward would be the one corresponding

to a floating rate regime (that is                      based on equation (3.5)). Rowever, in

the previous period agents formed their expectations under the belief that the

policy maker would not renege, so that unexpected inflation is based on

                   *
from 8°(g,g ) given in eq. (4.11) in that only the first term appears, since
a justified collapse is not followed by an increase of inflation expectations
          *
from   r(g )   to       r. Therefore:


                                                                               +            +                          -              *2
