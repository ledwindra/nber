ABSTRACT
We study the welfare costs of markups in a dynamic model with heterogeneous firms and
endogenously variable markups. We find that the welfare costs of markups are large. We
decompose the costs of markups into three channels: (i) an aggregate markup that acts like a
uniform output tax, (ii) misallocation of factors of production, and (iii) an inefficiently low rate of
entry. We find that the aggregate markup accounts for about two-thirds of the costs, misallocation
accounts for about one-third, and the costs due to inefficient entry are negligible. We evaluate
simple policies aimed at reducing the costs of markups. Subsidizing entry is not an effective tool
in our model: while more competition reduces individual firms' markups it also reallocates
market shares towards larger firms and the net effect is that the aggregate markup hardly changes.
Size-dependent policies aimed at reducing concentration can reduce the aggregate markup but
have the side effect of greatly increasing misallocation and reducing aggregate productivity.

Introduction

How large are the welfare costs of product market distortions? What kinds of policies can
best overcome these distortions? We answer these questions using a dynamic model with
heterogeneous firms and endogenously variable markups. In our model, the welfare costs of
markups can be decomposed into three channels. First, the aggregate markup — the costweighted average of firm-level markups — acts like a uniform output tax levied on all firms.
Second, there is cross-sectional markup dispersion because larger firms effectively face less
competition and so charge higher markups than smaller firms. This markup dispersion gives
rise to misallocation of factors of production across firms. Third, there is an inefficiently low
rate of entry. Our goal is to quantify these three channels using US data and to evaluate
policies aimed at reducing the costs of markups.
Our model features heterogeneous firms engaged in monopolistic competition with nonCES demand, as in Kimball (1995). Within a given industry, more productive firms are,
in equilibrium, larger and face less elastic demand and so charge higher markups than less
productive firms. As a consequence, changes in the environment that allow more productive
firms to grow at the expense of less productive firms will be associated with an increase
in the aggregate markup and a decline in the aggregate labor share. In this sense, our
model is consistent with the literature’s recent emphasis on the reallocation of production
from firms with relatively high measured labor shares to firms with relatively low measured
labor shares (Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson and Reenen, 2017a,b; Kehrig and Vincent, 2017)
and the observation that firms with high markups have been getting larger, driving up the
average markup (Baqaee and Farhi, 2018). Importantly, markups in our model are returns
to past sunk investments in developing new products and in acquiring capital. Policies
aimed at reducing markup distortions can have the unfortunate side-effect of distorting these
investment decisions.
We calculate the welfare costs of markups by asking how much the representative consumer would benefit if the economy transitioned from a steady state with markup distortions
to an efficient steady state. We calibrate the initial steady state to match the levels of concentration in sales in US data as well as the firm-level relationship between sales and the
wage bill. We find that the total welfare costs of markups are large. For our benchmark
calibration, the representative consumer would gain 7.5% in consumption-equivalent terms
if they transitioned from the initial distorted steady state to the efficient steady state.
We then turn to quantifying the relative importance of the three channels by which
markups reduce welfare in our model. We find that the aggregate markup distortion is the
most important channel, accounting for about two-thirds of the total costs in our benchmark
model. Misallocation accounts for about one-third of the total costs. The costs due to
inefficient entry are negligible.

We calibrate our benchmark model to match an aggregate markup of 1.15, corresponding to the 2012 estimate of Barkai (2017) for the US private sector. Recently De Loecker
and Eeckhout (2017) have estimated a 2012 economy-wide markup of about 1.6 based on
Compustat data. Their economy-wide markup of 1.6 is the sales-weighted average of firmlevel markups. But theory implies that it is the cost-weighted average of firm-level markups
that is the relevant statistic that summarizes the distortions to employment and investment
decisions. That is, the ‘wedges’ in the aggregate employment and investment optimality
conditions are proportional to the cost-weighted average markup, not the sales-weighted average. When we calculate this cost-weighted average using the same Compustat data we
obtain an aggregate markup of 1.25. In an alternative calibration of our model that matches
this higher level of markups we find that the representative consumer would gain 18.6% in
consumption-equivalent terms from the removal of all markup distortions, of which about
four-fifths are due to the aggregate markup and one-fifth is due to misallocation. Since the
Compustat data samples only the very largest firms in the US, we think of these larger losses
as an upper bound on the total costs of markups.
Although the losses from misallocation in our model are sizeable, accounting for an aggregate TFP loss of about 1.2% in our benchmark model, they are nonetheless small relative
to standard estimates in the literature (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008; Hsieh and Klenow,
2009). Misallocation losses are relatively small because high-productivity firms who charge
high markups do so precisely because they face low demand elasticities. With these low
demand elasticities, the aggregate technology features a kind of ‘near-satiation ’ where there
are strongly diminishing returns to increasing the output of an individual firm. This feature
of the technology implies that a benevolent planner cannot achieve large gains by reallocating
factors of production towards high-productivity firms. By contrast, if we incorrectly impose
constant elasticity demand, as standard in the literature, then the dispersion of markups
in our model would imply much larger losses from misallocation. With constant demand
elasticities a planner can achieve large gains by reallocating factors of production towards
high-productivity firms, so a given amount of markup dispersion is much more costly.
Our decomposition of the relative importance of the three channels by which markups
reduce welfare also helps us evaluate policies aimed at reducing markups. A sufficiently
sophisticated scheme of interventions can of course achieve the efficient allocation, but here
we are interested in simple policies that may be more practical. One such policy is subsidizing
entry (or reducing barriers to entry) so as to increase competition. We find that subsidizing
entry is not an effective policy tool in our model. In particular, we find that even a large
increase in the number of firms has a negligible effect on both the aggregate markup and
the amount of misallocation.1 To understand this, recall that the aggregate markup is a
cost-weighted average of firm-level markups. An increase in the number of firms has two
1

There are however standard love-of-variety gains from increasing the number of firms.

effects on this weighted average. The direct effect is a reduction in the markups of each firm.
But there is also an important compositional effect. In our model, small firms face more
elastic demand and are vulnerable to competition from entrants. Large firms face less elastic
demand and are less vulnerable to competition. So when there is an increase in the number
of firms, small, low markup firms contract by more than large, high markup firms and the
resulting reallocation means high markup firms get relatively more weight in the aggregate
markup calculation. In our model, this offsetting compositional effect is almost exactly as
large as the direct effect so that overall the aggregate markup falls by a negligible amount.2
Another example of a simple policy is the use of size-dependent taxes to reduce withinindustry concentration and thereby reduce the markups of large producers. We find that
taxes that fall disproportionately on large firms, which is a simple way to model antitrust
policy, can substantially reduce the aggregate markup in our model, but they come at considerable cost. This is because in our model the distorted allocation actually features too
little concentration relative to the efficient allocation and a further reduction in concentration
increases misallocation thereby reducing aggregate productivity.
This result has implications for the design of policy responses to the simultaneous rise in
concentration and markups. Regardless of whether the rise in concentration and markups
is due to changes in regulation, as in Peltzman (2014) and Grullon, Larkin and Michaely
(2017), or changes in the scalability of technology, as in Haskel and Westlake (2017), or
some mix of the two, size-dependent policies aimed at reducing concentration in order to
bring down the overall level of markups may backfire because of the resulting increase in
misallocation. Empirically, this also suggests that if the rise in concentration and markups
observed in recent US data is due to a reduction in, say, antitrust enforcement, then it may
be the case that the overall level of markups rose yet at the same time misallocation fell.
This is speculative, but is consistent with Baqaee and Farhi (2018) who document that the
increase in concentration and markups in the US has been accompanied by an improvement
in allocative efficiency.
Finally we show that our key results are not driven by our assumptions about market
structure. Our benchmark model uses monopolistic competition with non-CES demand. But
in our robustness section we study an alternative model in which variable markups arise due
to oligopolistic competition among a finite number of heterogeneous firms, as in Atkeson and
Burstein (2008) and Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2015). When this model with oligopolistic
competition is calibrated to match the same US concentration facts as our benchmark model,
we again find that the losses from misallocation are relatively small and that even large
increases in the number of firms have small effects on the aggregate markup and misallocation.
2

These offsetting direct and compositional effects are reminiscent of results in the trade literature, e.g.,
Bernard, Eaton, Jensen and Kortum (2003) and Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2017).

Existing results on costs of markups. The starting point for discussion of the welfare
costs of markups is Dixit and Stiglitz (1977), though the literature goes back to Lerner (1934).
Recent work such as Zhelobodko, Kokovin, Parenti and Thisse (2012), Dhingra and Morrow
(2016) and Behrens, Mion, Murata and Suedekum (2018) studies variable markups in static
models with heterogeneous firms. In contrast, ours is a dynamic model where markups are
returns to past investments. Though policies that reduce markups may be beneficial in the
short run, they are costly overall because they depress the returns to such investments. Like
us, Bilbiie, Ghironi and Melitz (2008) study a dynamic model and quantify the costs of
markups but they assume a representative firm. We find, however, that accounting for firm
heterogeneity plays a crucial role in evaluating policies aimed at reducing markup distortions.3
Markups and misallocation. In our model markups increase with firm size. This is one
form of misallocation in the sense of Restuccia and Rogerson (2008), and Hsieh and Klenow
(2009). We find that the losses from this form of misallocation are on the order of 1 to 3%.
This suggests that size-dependent subsidies can increase aggregate productivity by at most 1
to 3%. We view these numbers as an upper bound on the gains from size-dependent subsidies
since we attribute all of the systematic relationship between firm revenue productivity and
firm size to market power, and not to, say, overhead costs as in Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson
and Reenen (2017b) and Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and Scarpetta (2013). Because of this
we are likely somewhat overstating the true relationship between markups and firm size and
overstating the losses from this form of misallocation.
It is important to recognize that we abstract from all other sources of markup variation that may cause misallocation. Firms may operate in different locations or sell different
products in different sectors and charge different markups depending on the amount of competition they face in those different markets. In principle policies that condition on location
or other relevant market details may be able to address these forms of misallocation too.
But finely-tuned policies that condition on details of market conditions location-by-location
would require large amounts of information and may need to be adjusted frequently based on
changing conditions. All this seems challenging in practice. For this reason we have limited
our analysis to size-dependent markup variation and we find that the gains from eliminating
misallocation due to size-dependent markup variation are likely no more than 2 to 3%.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 characterizes the
efficient allocation against which we assess the costs of markups. Section 4 explains how we
calibrate the model to match US concentration facts. Section 5 presents our results on the
costs of markups. Section 6 discusses the robustness of our results. Section 7 concludes.

Other related work includes Atkeson and Burstein (2010, 2018) who provide a welfare analysis of innovation policies in firm dynamics models but who abstract from variable markups and Peters (2016) who studies
innovation, firm dynamics, and variable markups but who does not evaluate the welfare costs of markups.

Model

The economy consists of a representative consumer with preferences over final consumption
and labor supply and who owns all the firms. The final good is produced by perfectly
competitive firms using a bundle of differentiated intermediate inputs. The differentiated
inputs are produced by monopolistically competitive firms using capital, labor and materials.
To enter the differentiated input market a firm must expend a fixed quantity of labor to
develop a blueprint. Upon entry and after it learns its productivity, the firm makes a onceand-for-all decision about how much to invest in its capital. There is no aggregate uncertainty.
We focus on characterizing the steady state and transitional dynamics after a policy change.

subject to the budget constraint
Ct = Wt Lt + Πt ,
where Ct denotes consumption of the numeraire final good, Lt denotes labor supply, Wt
denotes the real wage, and Πt denotes aggregate firm profits, net of intangible investment
and the cost of creating new firms. The representative consumer’s labor supply satisfies
ψCt Lνt = Wt .
Since firms are owned by the representative consumer they use the one-period discount factor
βCt /Ct+1 to discount future profit flows.
Final good producers. Let Yt denote aggregate production of the final good. This can
be used for consumption Ct , investment in intangible capital Xt , or as materials Bt , so that
Ct + Xt + Bt = Yt .
The use of the final good as materials gives the model a simple roundabout production
structure, as in Jones (2011) and Baqaee and Farhi (2018).
The final good Yt is produced by perfectly competitive firms using a bundle of differentiated intermediate inputs yt (ω) for ω ∈ [0, Nt ] where Nt denotes the mass of available
varieties. This bundle of inputs is assembled into final goods using the Kimball aggregator

The left panel of Figure 1 shows the shape of Υ(q). Setting ε = 0 gives the CES case
σ−1
Υ(q) = q σ . When ε > 0, the elasticity of substitution is lower for firms with higher
relative quantity q = y/Y , implying that larger firms choose higher markups. We view
this as a parsimonious and tractable way of modeling the forces that arise in models of
oligopolistic competition of the type studied by Atkeson and Burstein (2008) and Edmond,
Midrigan and Xu (2015). In those models larger firms face less competition in their own
industries, have lower demand elasticities and choose higher markups. Indeed, as we show
in our robustness section, many of the results in our setting with monopolisic competition
extend to an environment with oligopolistic competition.
Love of variety. This specification of the production function implies love of variety in the
sense that aggregate productivity increases with the number of firms. To see this, suppose
that there are N firms in the economy with a constant returns technology in labor, y = l.
Assuming a total labor L available for production, in a symmetric equilibrium y = L/N so

that the total amount of final output is given by N Υ(y/Y ) = N Υ(L/(N Y )) = 1. Aggregate
productivity E = Y /L is then implicitly determined by N Υ(1/(N E)) = 1. In the CES special
1
case ε = 0 we get the familiar solution E = N σ−1 . When ε > 0, aggregate productivity E is
more sensitive to the number of varieties N , as shown in the right panel of Figure 1.
Intermediate input producers. Each variety ω is produced by a single firm. Firms are
created by paying a sunk cost κ in units of labor. On entry, a new firm obtains a one-time
productivity draw e ∼ G(e). Firms exit with exogenous probability δ per period. We focus
on a symmetric equilibrium where producers with the same e will make the same decisions so
henceforth we will simply index firms by e. On entry and after drawing e, a new firm makes
a one-time irreversible investment in capital, xt (e). This capital does not depreciate, so the
amount of capital available to a producer of age i = 1, 2, ... is
kit (e) = xt−i (e).
The assumption that capital is chosen once-and-for-all is a simple way of introducing adjustment costs that prevent capital from reallocating across firms after policy reforms. This
assumption also lets us capture investments in intangible capital, whose resale value is much
lower than that of tangible capital (as in Haskel and Westlake, 2017).
A firm of age i and productivity e uses its capital kit (e) = xt−i (e), hires labor l and
purchases materials b to produce output according to
yit (e) = e kit (e)1−η vit (e)η ,

We break the firm’s problem into two steps, first solving a static profit maximization
problem taking as given the initial investment, and then solving the firm’s dynamic choice of
whether to enter and how much capital to acquire at entry.

When ε = 0, this reduces to the familiar CES markup µ = σ/(σ − 1). When ε > 0, larger
firms find it optimal to choose higher markups. The extent to which a firm’s markup increases
with its relative size is determined by ε/σ. The ratio of these two parameters is therefore
critical in shaping how markups and quantities change with productivity and competition.
Figure 2 illustrates these static choices, plotting the markup µ(z), relative quantity q(z)
and employment l(z), as a function of effective productivity z. When ε is relatively high, the
markup increases more with productivity, implying that the quantity increases less with productivity. Indeed, when productivity is sufficiently high, employment may actually decrease
with productivity because of strongly diminishing marginal revenue productivity.
Note that the firm’s quantity choice is bounded. A profit-maximizing firm will not increase
production to the point where the elasticity of demand from (11) is less than one. This implies
a bound on the relative quantity equal to
σ

q < σε.
The model therefore implies a threshold level of productivity z̄ above which all firms produce
the same amount of output and respond to an increase in productivity z by simply reducing
the amount of variable inputs needed to produce a fixed amount of output.
Also note that
π(z) = p(z)y(z) − Pv v(z)

Pv v(z)

(14)

Since markups are increasing in relative size q(z) this implies that a firm’s variable input
share in sales and well as the sales share of payments to each factor are decreasing in q(z).
Dynamic problem. Now consider a firm at time t that has paid the sunk cost κWt to enter
and drawn e ∼ G(e). From (8), a firm with effective productivity z will have flow profits
πt+i (z) at age i = 1, 2, . . . . Choosing investment xt (e) at entry determines their effective
productivity z = e xt (e)1−η going forward and delivers the profit stream πt+i (e xt (e)1−η ) for
i = 1, 2, . . . . So having drawn e, a firm that enters at date t choose xt (e) to maximize

In short, a firm’s incentives to enter are determined by its operating profits, net of investment,
and are therefore a function of markups and the firm’s overall sales. Both markups and a
firm’s sales decrease with additional entry so that entry occurs to the point at which the
expected profits are equal to the cost of creating a new variety.
Equilibrium. Let Ht (z) denote the measure of firms with effective firm productivity z in

period t. Let Nt = dHt (z) denote the overall mass of firms in period t. Given an initial
measure H0 (z), a recursive equilibrium is a sequence of firm prices pt (z) and allocations
yt (z), vt (z), lt (z), bt (z), xt (z), mass of new entrants Mt , wage rate Wt , aggregate output Yt ,
consumption Ct , and labor supply Lt , as well as measure of effective productivity Ht (z), such
that firms and consumers optimize and the labor and goods markets all clear.
The total mass of firms evolves according
Nt+1 = (1 − δ)Nt + Mt ,
while the measure of effective productivity evolves according to

where the second-last term on the RHS reflects investment by the new entrants and the last
term on the RHS reflects purchases of materials by all firms.
Aggregation. We now derive an aggregate production function for this economy and show
how aggregate productivity and the aggregate input choices relate to the cross-sectional
distribution of markups. These aggregation results motivate a two-step approach that we
use to compute an equilibrium. First, given a distribution Ht (z) of individual firms’ effective
productivity, we solve for the relative quantities qt (z) = yt (z)/Yt that maximize firm profits.
Second, given these choices, we solve for all aggregate prices and quantities.
Let Zt denote the aggregate productivity of this economy, implicitly defined by an aggregate
production function that relates the total amount of final goods Yt to the total amount of
the composite variable input Vt used in production:
Yt = Zt Vtη .

Solution algorithm. We now outline how we solve the model. We use the aggregation
results above to calculate the aggregate production function and evaluate the representative
consumer’s optimality conditions, which are functions solely of aggregate variables, including
the aggregate markup Mt and productivity Zt . Given a sequence of Mt and Zt we can solve
for the equilibrium of this economy at each date. We also note that for a given measure of
producers Ht (z), computing Mt and Zt is relatively straightforward. In particular, we can
scale the profit function in (8) by the demand index Dt and aggregate output Yt and write

We then pin down the equilibrium value of At using the Kimball aggregator

From these we can compute the aggregate markup Mt and productivity Zt .5
Given an initial conjecture for the sequence of Ht (z) during the transition, we can compute
the aggregate prices and quantities at each date and then use these, together with the free
entry condition (19) and an entrant’s optimal investment choice (17), to obtain an updated
sequence Ht (z). We then iterate on the implied fixed-point problem in the sequence Ht (z)
until convergence.

Efficient allocation

In this section we derive the efficient allocation in our economy by considering the problem
of a benevolent planner who faces the same technological and resource constraints as in
the decentralized economy. Comparing the efficient allocation chosen by the planner to the
decentralized allocation reveals three channels through which markups distort outcomes in
the decentralized economy: (i) the aggregate markup acts like a uniform output tax, (ii)
markup dispersion gives rise to misallocation of factors of production, and (iii) markups
distort the entry margin.
Planner’s problem. The planner chooses how many varieties to create, how to allocate
factors of production, how much to invest, consume, and work so as to maximize the representative consumer’s utility subject to the resource constraints for labor (21) and goods
(22), the law of motion for the distribution of productivity (20), the production functions (6)
and (7), and the Kimball aggregator (2). The initial condition for this problem is the initial
distribution of productivities H0 (z).
We use asterisks to denote the planner’s allocation. It turns out to be convenient to solve
the planner’s problem by expressing aggregate output as a function of the history of past
∗
entry Mt−i
and investment x∗t−i choices. With this change of variables, the planner’s problem
can be written as maximizing

where qit∗ (e) is the relative quantity of a productive unit that began i periods earlier with draw
e. In writing these two constraints we have used the constant exit rate δ and the expression
for aggregate productivity Zt in equation (27).
We again break the problem into two steps, first solving a static allocation problem and
then determining the remaining variables.
Planner’s static allocation. To determine qit∗ (e) we first recognize that it is sufficient
to determine qt∗ (z), since age i only matters through the choice of initial investment, which
in this notation is summarized by z. Then let λ∗1,t denote the multiplier on the planner’s
resource constraint (34) and λ∗2,t denote the multiplier on the Kimball aggregator (35). The
first order condition that determines qt∗ (z) can be written

(37)

As in the decentralized equilibrium, the distribution of individual productivities only affects
qt∗ (z) through the aggregate A∗t . We can therefore solve (36) for an arbitrary value of this
statistic and then find the specific value of A∗t that satisfies the Kimball aggregator (35).
Misallocation. Comparing the equilibrium allocation in (30) and the planner’s allocation
in (36) reveals the misallocation among existing firms in the decentralized equilibrium. Since
more productive firms have higher markups, they produce too little compared to the social
optimum and employ too little of the variable factors. Figure 3 illustrates the misallocation
by comparing the relative sizes of firms in the decentralized equilibrium to the relative size the
planner would allocate for them. The planner’s allocation is not log-linear in productivity, as
it would be with CES demand. The extra concavity reflects strongly diminishing marginal
productivity as relative quantity increases. As we discuss below, this feature of the model
implies that the gains from reallocating factors of production are not as high in this economy
as would be the case in an economy with CES demand (for a given distribution of markups).

Comparing this with the steady state capital/output ratio in the decentralized equilibrium,

because of the aggregate markup distortion.

The term ∗it (e) is the inverse elasticity of the Kimball aggregator Υ(q) evaluated at the
planner’s allocation for a particular variety qit∗ (e). The term p∗it (e) is the social value of an
additional unit of that variety, i.e., the planner’s counterpart to the market price.
Comparing the free-entry condition in the decentralized equilibrium (19) to the planner’s entry condition (40), we recover an important insight of Bilbiie, Ghironi and Melitz
(2008), Zhelobodko, Kokovin, Parenti and Thisse (2012) and Dhingra and Morrow (2016):
the planner’s incentives to create new varieties are determined by the inverse elasticity (e)
of the aggregator while the incentives for new firms to enter are determined by their markups
µ(e). CES demand is the knife-edge special case where these incentives coincide, i.e., where
µ(e) = (e) = σ/(σ − 1) for all e. Figure 4 plots markups µ(e) and the inverse elasticity
(e) against productivity. Low productivity firms have low markups and do not value entry
as much as the planner values their entry. High productivity firms have high markups and
value entry more than the planner does.

Whether the N/Y ratio is too low or too high compared to the efficient allocation is ambiguous
and depends on precise details of the parameterization.
To summarize, misalignment between the planner’s and the firms’ incentives to enter is
another source of inefficiency in this economy. The amount of entry in the decentralized
equilibrium is determined by the firm’s expected markups, which do not coincide with the
planner’s marginal valuation of new varieties except in the special case of CES demand.
Implementation. One way to implement the planner’s allocations in the decentralized
equilibrium is to subsidize production. Suppose that each firm receives a size-dependent
subsidy T (s) that depends on the amount the firm sells, s = py. It is straightforward to
show that the planner’s allocation can be implemented by setting a subsidy equal to


s
DY − s
T (s) = Υ
p(s)Y
where D is the demand index in (4) and p(s) is the firm’s price. This subsidy ensures that
the private incentives to produce, invest, and enter are aligned with those of the planner.
Figure 5 illustrates the shape of the subsidy function. The left panel shows the average
subsidy, T (s)/s. Since Υ(0) > 0, the optimal subsidy is positive even if the firm does not
18

produce at all, T (0) > 0.6 This lump-sum component of the subsidy ensures that the amount
of entry is optimal and implies the average subsidy is U-shaped in the amount the firm sells.
The right panel shows the marginal subsidy T 0 (s) which, unlike the average subsidy, is strictly
increasing in size. This is because the marginal subsidy is equal to the desired markup of a
firm of that size, T 0 (s) = σ/(σ − q(s)ε/σ ), which increases in the firm’s relative size.

Quantifying the model

In this section we first outline our calibration strategy and our model’s implications for the
cross-sectional distribution of markups. We then calculate the aggregate productivity losses
due to misallocation in this economy. Our calibrated model features a considerable amount
of markup dispersion and standard methods for estimating the losses due to misallocation
based on a constant demand elasticity, such as Hsieh and Klenow (2009), would conclude that
misallocation losses are large. But as we show, these standard methods based on a constant
demand elasticity significantly overstate the actual misallocation losses in our model.

4.1

Calibration strategy

The level and dispersion of markups in our model depend crucially on three underlying
parameters: (i) the average elasticity of demand σ, (ii) the sensitivity of a firm’s demand
elasticity to its relative size, as determined by the ‘super-elasticity ’ parameter ε, and (iii)
the amount of productivity dispersion. For parsimony and as is standard in the literature we
assume that the distribution of productivity G(e) is Pareto with tail parameter ξ.
Intuitively, σ pins down the overall level of markups, ε pins down how markups µi and
hence a firm’s wage bill, wi li ∼ pi yi /µi vary with firm sales, and the Pareto tail parameter ξ
pins down the concentration of firm sales. We choose these three parameters by simultaneously matching, for the 2012 US economy, an estimate of the aggregate markup, key moments
of the distribution of sales for firms in 6-digit NAICS industries, and the relationship between
a firm’s wage bill (payroll) and sales for the 2012 US economy.7
4.1.1

Assigned parameters

We assume that a period is one year and set the discount factor β = 0.96 and exit rate
δ = 0.1. We set the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply to ν = 1. We normalize
the disutility from labor supply ψ and the entry cost κ to achieve a steady-state output of
Since Υ0 (0) < ∞, and we assume constant returns to capital and variable inputs, there is a cutoff level
of productivity e below which the firm does not produce since its price would be above the choke price.
Whether there is indeed a mass of firms whose productivity falls below this cutoff depends on the exact
parameterization of the model.

Y = 1 and a steady-state total mass of firms N = 1 for our benchmark economy. We set the

labor in production φ = 0.676 to match the 45% share of materials in total sales in the US
private business sector in 2012. Finally, we set the elasticity of the variable input, η = 0.865
to match the 0.15 ratio of private non-residential investment to private sector value added in
2012 in the US. We report all these parameter choices in Panel A of Table 1.
4.1.2

Calibrated parameters

In this section we explain how we choose values for the key parameters σ, ε, and ξ that
determine the amount of concentration in sales and level and dispersion of markups.
Aggregate markup. First, we require that our model matches an aggregate markup of
M = 1.15, corresponding to the estimate of Barkai (2017) for 2012. Intuitively, this moment
pins down the average elasticity σ.
Distribution of relative sales. Second, we require that our model matches the unweighted and weighted (by firm sales) distribution of relative sales of firms in each 6-digit

20

industry. We define relative sales as the average sales of firms in a given size class and industry relative to the average sales of all firms in that industry. For brevity, from now on we
refer to a group of firms in a given size class as firms. We pool observations of relative sales
across all industries and report moments of this distribution in the left column of Table 2.

Now consider Panel A of Table 2 which summarizes the unweighted distribution of relative
sales. In the data, 32.9% of all firms have average sales that are less then 1/10th of the
industry average. The vast majority of firms, some 87.7%, sell less then their industry
average. About 1% of all firms have sales that exceed 10 times the industry average and
about 0.1% of all firms sell more than 50 times the industry average. Now consider Panel
B of Table 2 which summarizes the sales-weighted distribution. The 32.9% smallest firms
21

that have relative sales below 1/10th of their industry average account for a total of 1.9% of
overall sales in the US. The 87.7% smallest firms that have relative sales below their industry
average together account for 15.4% of overall sales. Finally, the 1% of the firms whose sales
exceed 10 times their industry average account for a share of 1 − 0.66 = 0.34 or 34% of total
sales and the 0.1% of firms whose sales exceed 50 times their industry average account for a
share of 1 − 0.951 = 0.049 or 4.9% of total sales. We choose the Pareto tail ξ to minimize
the distance between all these moments in the data and the model.
Relationship between relative wages and relative sales. We now discuss the set of
moments that allow us to pin down the super-elasticity ε. We calculate, for each size class
in each industry, the relative wage bill of firms in that size class, defined as the average wage
bill of firms in that size class in that industry relative to the average wage bill of firms in
that industry. The model implies that the relative wage bill of firm i depends on its relative
sales and relative markup according to
relative wage billi =

relative salesi
.
relative markupi

If ε is equal to zero, markups do not increase with firm sales and the relative wage bill would
increase one-for-one with relative sales. But if ε is positive, markups increase with firms
sales implying that the relative wage bill increases less than one-for-one with sales. The
extent to which the relative wage bill increases with relative sales is therefore informative
about the extent to which markups increase with firm size. By expressing both the wage
bill and sales in relative terms we are effectively subtracting industry-specific differences in
production functions (in say η or φ) and using within-industry variation to identify ε.
Figure 6 shows the relationship between the relative wage bill and relative sales in the
data. Each circle corresponds to one size class in a given industry and the diameter of the
circle indicates the total sales accounted for by firms in that particular size class. The dotted
line in the figure is the 45-degree line, which corresponds to an economy with ε = 0 in which
markups do not systematically increase with size. Though the pattern is difficult to see from
simply eyeballing the data, the relative wage bill increases less than one-for-one with sales.
The slope coefficient of a regression, weighted by firm sales, is equal to 0.964 when we restrict
the sample to firms with relative sales greater than 1 (0.970 for the full sample). Larger firms
thus have a smaller share of payments to labor, a pattern which our model interprets as
evidence that markups increase with sales.
There are of course other plausible explanations for such a pattern. For example, a
fixed (overhead) component to a firm’s wage bill would also imply that larger firms have a
disproportionately low wage bill.8 Similarly, this pattern could arise if larger firms outsource

a larger fraction of their activities or have a larger capital share. In this sense we view our
estimates as providing an upper bound on how rapidly markups increase with size.
We now explain how we use this evidence to estimate the super-elasticity ε. Our model
implies a non-linear relationship between the relative wage bill and relative sales which is a
function of ε and the other parameters
log(relative wage billi ) = F (log(relative salesi ) ; ε),
with a higher ε implying a flatter slope. We can use this relationship to calculate what the
model predicts a firm’s relative wage bill should be given its relative sales for any given ε
in the steady state of the model. We then choose ε to minimize the distance between the
model’s prediction and the actual relative wage bill observed in the data

where ωi is the overall sales share of firms in each size class.
To summarize, we jointly choose the parameters σ, ε and ξ to (i) match a 15% aggregate
markup, (ii) match the distribution of relative sales summarized in Table 2, and (iii) minimize
23

the distance between the model’s predictions for a firm’s wage bill as a function of its relative
sales and the corresponding observations in the data. For our benchmark calibration we pool
together data from all industries. In our robustness section below we provide alternative
estimates of ξ and ε based on various NAICS industries.
Model Fit. Panel B of Table 1 above reports the parameter values that minimize our
objective function. The elasticity of substitution σ is equal to 11.55, the super-elasticity ε
is equal to 2.18, while the Pareto tail coefficient ξ is equal to 6.66. Though our estimate of
ε/σ = 0.189 is much lower than typically assumed in macro studies that attempt to match
the response of prices to changes in monetary policy or exchange rates, it is in line with
the micro estimates surveyed by Klenow and Willis (2016). In our robustness section below
we present alternative estimates of ε/σ derived from more disaggregated product-level data
on markups and sales for the panel of Taiwanese manufacturing firms studied by Edmond,
Midrigan and Xu (2015). We find that a ratio of about ε/σ of about 0.15 best fits the crosssectional relationship between markups and market size in that micro data, an estimate very
close to that produced by our benchmark calibration strategy.
With these parameters the model matches the aggregate markup of 15% exactly. Table 2
shows that the model reproduces well the concentration in industry sales observed in the
data, especially at the top. For example, in the data the fraction of firms that sell at least 10
times more than their industry average is equal to 1% and these firms account for 34% of all
sales. In the model the fraction of firms that sell at least 10 times more than their industry
average is equal to 1.3% and these firms account for 33.9% of all sales. Finally, the solid line
in Figure 6 shows the model’s predictions for how the relative wage bill varies with relative
firm size. Recall that in the data the slope coefficient of a regression, weighted by firm sales,
is equal to 0.964 when we restrict the sample to firms with relative sales greater than 1. The
corresponding elasticity in the model is 0.965.
Alternative ‘high ε/σ’ calibration. The magnitude of ε/σ is critical for the model so
we now provide some intuition as to how this ratio is identified. In particular, we report
results for an alternative ‘high ε/σ’ calibration with ε/σ = 0.4, about twice as large as
our benchmark. For this experiment we re-calibrate the Pareto tail parameter ξ to match
the size distribution of firms and the elasticity parameter σ to match the 15% aggregate
markup while continuing to assign all other parameters as before. We report the re-calibrated
parameter values and the model’s fit for the distribution of sales in Table 1 and Table 2 above.
Importantly, this version of the model provides much worse fit to the concentration in sales at
the top. Since high ε/σ means that markups are increasing rapidly with size, this version of
the model predicts too few large firms compared to the data. Figure 7 shows this economy’s
predictions for how the relative wage bill changes with relative sales. The poor fit at the top

24

Figure 7: Alternative high ε/σ calibration provides worse fit

of the distribution is evident. With a higher ε the model implies much higher markups for
the largest firms and therefore a much smaller wage bill relative to sales and is incapable of
reproducing the relationship between the wage bill and sales in the data.9

4.2

Markup distribution

Our model’s implications for the steady-state markup distribution are given in Panel A
of Table 3. Here we report the aggregate markup M, i.e., the cost-weighted average of
individual markups, and the cost-weighted percentiles of the markup distribution for both
our benchmark and the alternative high ε/σ calibration. We also compare our model’s
implications to estimates of markups from the publicly available Compustat data for the US
for 2012. To calculate these, we follow the approach of De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) using
the ratio of sales to the cost of goods sold, scaled by estimates (at the 2-digit industry level)
of the cost elasticity in the production function from Karabarbounis and Neiman (2018).10
9

We have also used the methods proposed by Andrews, Gentzkow and Shapiro (2017) to examine this
argument more formally. We find that the derivate of the moments for wage bill relative to sales and relative

The distribution of markups in our benchmark model ranges from 1.1 at the 25th percentile
to 1.24 at the 90th percentile. The dispersion of markups increases very little in the high ε/σ
economy which implies a 25th percentile of 1.08 and a 90th percentile of 1.27. The Compustat
data implies an aggregate markup of 1.26, larger than our calibration target of 1.15. The
Compustat data also implies more dispersed markups than in our model. We do not find
these discrepancies between the model and the data critical for two reasons. First, the sample
of Compustat firms includes only a subset of the very largest firms in the US, those that are
publicly traded. By contrast, our calibration uses the estimates of the aggregate markup
from Barkai (2017) for the entire US private sector. Second, the ratio of sales to costs in the
data may reflect distortions other than markups (for example credit constraints) or perhaps
may vary across firms due to non-convexities, differences in technologies or costs of adjusting
factors of production. Indeed, we find that most of the markup dispersion in the Compustat
data is not systematically related to firm size.11
sales concentration are both very responsive to the value of ε/σ and in this sense ε/σ is locally identified.
10
If we include selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) in our measure of costs, as Traina (2018)
does, then the cost-weighted average markup falls from 1.26 to 1.21.
11
See also Hall (2018) who finds that the average US markup (weighted by value-added shares) increased
from 1.12 in 1988 to 1.38 in 2015 in KLEMS data.

26

Figure 8: Cost-weighted vs. sales-weighted average markups, Compustat data

Solid blue line shows the sales-weighted average of firm-level markups, as in De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017). Dashed red
line shows the cost-weighted average of firm-level markups. The former has increased by a larger amount, but the latter is the
relevant measure of the aggregate distortion to first-order conditions that results in welfare losses.

Our observation that the aggregate markup in the 2012 Compustat data is about 1.26 may
seem to contradict the findings of De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) who report an aggregate
markup of about 1.6. But there is in fact no contradiction. The measure of aggregate
markup we construct is the cost-weighted average of individual markups (equivalently, the
harmonic sales-weighted average), since this is the object that distorts the aggregate firstorder conditions and results in welfare losses. By contrast, De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017)
report the arithmetic sales-weighted average of markups. As Figure 8 shows, the latter has
increased much more in the last several decades than the cost-weighted average, owing to an
increase in markups at the top of the distribution.12 Viewed through the lens of our model,
the increase in the sales-weighted average markup overstates the increase in the distortions
to inputs because it implicitly overstates the amount of inputs hired by high-markup firms.
Alternative ‘high M’ calibration. Our benchmark calibration targets an aggregate
markup of M = 1.15 corresponding to the estimates from Barkai (2017) for the entire
US private sector. To assess the sensitivity of our results to this target for the overall level
of market power we also report results for an alternative ‘high M’ calibration that targets
M = 1.25 corresponding to the cost-weighted average of markups in the Compustat data.
12

See also Figure B.4(b) in De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) which reports a very similar pattern.

27

We re-calibrate the parameters σ, ε and ξ to match this higher aggregate markup but keeping
our other target moments the same as in our benchmark.13 We report the re-calibrated parameter values and the model’s fit for the distribution of sales in Table 1 and Table 2 above.
This version of the model provide a similar fit to the concentration data as our benchmark,
though it predicts slightly too many firms at the very top when compared to the data (or our
benchmark model). As shown in Panel A of Table 3 above, this version of the model implies
larger and more dispersed markups than our benchmark model but does not fully capture
the dispersion in markups in the Compustat data.

4.3

Implications for misallocation

The markup dispersion generated by our model implies that there are aggregate productivity
losses due to misallocation. How large are these losses due to misallocation? As shown in
Panel B of Table 3 above, aggregate productivity E in the steady state of our benchmark
economy is 1.2% below the level of aggregate productivity that could be achieved by a
planner facing the same technology and resource constraints who could optimally reallocate
all factors of production (including capital) across producers. Since the high ε/σ calibration
implies larger and more dispersed markups, it implies a larger 2.1% loss from misallocation.
Our benchmark 1.2% loss from misallocation is an economically substantial effect but
is much smaller than the losses from misallocation that have featured prominently in the
literature, e.g., Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009).14 We now show
that we can reconcile our findings with these estimates in the literature by recognizing that
existing estimates typically rely on the assumption of CES demand, whereas our calculations
use the actual demand system implied by the Kimball aggregator. We show that incorrectly
assuming CES demand implies losses from misallocation that are much larger.
Misallocation with a CES aggregator. Suppose a researcher uses data on the distribution of markups µ(e) generated by our model but incorrectly specifies the final goods
aggregator to be of the CES, rather than the Kimball form:

We also adjust the weight on labor in production to φ = 0.610 and the elasticity of the variable input to
η = 0.853 so that we continue to match our targets for the share of materials in total sales and the share of
investment in total value added.
14
See also Baqaee and Farhi (2018) who proposes an alternative non-parametric approach to calculating
the evolution of these misallocation losses over time.

is below that under the efficient allocation whenever markups are dispersed.
In Panel B of Table 3 we report the loss implied by comparing E and E ∗ calculated using
M
= 7.67, i.e., the constant
the CES formula. For our benchmark model we set σ̄ = M−1
elasticity that rationalizes our model’s aggregate markup of M = 1.15. Assuming a CES
aggregator we would conclude that misallocation losses are 8.4%, almost 7 times larger than
the actual loss of 1.2% implied by the Kimball aggregator. For our high M = 1.25 economy
M
we set σ̄ = M−1
= 5. This gives similar results to our benchmark. The CES formula implies a
loss of 8.7% whereas the true loss implied by the Kimball aggregator is 1.3%. For our high ε/σ
economy markups are more dispersed so the CES formula implies a loss from misallocation
of 16.7%, much larger than the 2.1% true loss implied by the Kimball aggregator.
Why does the CES measurement overstate the true misallocation losses? The
CES measurement overstates the gains the planner could achieve by reallocating factors of
production from low e firms to high e firms. To understand this, observe that the true
demand elasticity with the Kimball technology is
−

ε
Υ0 (q)
= σq − σ ,
00
Υ (q)q

which implies that with the Kimball technology the planner encounters strongly diminishing
marginal product from allocating more factors to firms that already have high q. Loosely
speaking, it is as if the planner encounters a form of ‘near-satiation ’. It is of course precisely
this form of near-satiation that leads high e firms in the decentralized equilibrium to charge
high markups. For high q firms lowering prices generates few additional sales so higher
productivity simply translates to higher markups. The CES assumption interprets these high
markups as a great potential source of gains from reallocation because it does not recognize
that reallocating factors towards such firms will run into the same strongly diminishing
marginal product that generates high markups in the first place.

29

The key point is that explicitly modeling the source of markup variation has important
implications for inferring their costs. Dispersion in markups may not necessarily be as costly
as implied by CES calculations which do not take an explicit stand on the underlying source
of the distortions in the firms’ optimality conditions. Of course, these results reflect a very
specific source of markup variation, namely Kimball demand. But in our robustness section
below we show that similar conclusions are reached in an alternative model of oligopolistic
competition calibrated to match the same concentration facts.

5

How costly are markups?

We now present our main quantitative results on the welfare costs of markups. We answer two
questions. First, how large are the total welfare costs of markups in our economy? Second,
what is the relative importance of the three channels by which markups distort allocations?
We answer the first question by asking how much the representative consumer would benefit from a full implementation of the efficient allocation that eliminates markup distortions,
taking all of the transitional dynamics into account. We find that the total welfare costs of
markups are large. Implementing the efficient allocation results in a consumption equivalent
welfare gain of about 7.5%.
We answer the second question by removing each of the three channels in isolation using
offsetting subsidies. We show that a uniform output subsidy of 15% that exactly offsets the
aggregate markup goes a long way towards achieving full efficiency, removing about twothirds of the total costs of markups. We show that size-dependent taxes and subsidies that
remove misallocation while keeping the aggregate markup unchanged remove about one-third
of the total costs of markups. Although the channels are not strictly additive, this suggests
there is not much scope for large gains from correcting distortions to the entry margin. Indeed
we find that subsidizing entry removes at most about 1/10th of the total cost of markups.

5.1

Total cost of markups

We first contrast the distorted steady state in our decentralized equilibrium to that chosen
by a planner, then calculate the transitional dynamics of the economy from the initial distorted steady state to the efficient steady state, and finally calculate the welfare gains from
implementing the efficient steady state taking these transitional dynamics into account.
Steady state comparison. Table 4 compares the distorted steady state to the efficient
steady state. In the efficient steady state output is higher by 37%, consumption by 30.5%,
and employment by 16.7% relative to the distorted steady state. The efficient steady state
also calls for more product variety, the mass of firms is higher by 15.7%. The capital stock
is 50.9% higher. Aggregate efficiency is 3.8% higher. As discussed above, misallocation only

reduces efficiency in our benchmark economy by 1.2%, so the bulk of this increase in efficiency
is due to the increase in product variety, not the removal of misallocation.
Welfare gains from implementing efficient allocation. We calculate the welfare gains
by solving for the planner’s optimal paths for investment, variety creation, labor supply, etc,
starting from the distribution H0 (z) in the distorted steady state. Both the mass of varieties
and the amount of intangible capital for each firm are initially distorted, so the transitional
dynamics are long-lasting, reflecting both the planner’s desire to smooth consumption and
the irreversibility of the initial intangible investment choices.
Figure 9 shows the planner’s choices during the transition from the distorted steady state
to the efficient one. The upper-left panel shows that the planner increases the amount of
dispersion in investment across the low and high productivity firms. The upper-right panel of
the figure shows that consumption increases gradually, owing to the representative consumer’s
preference for consumption smoothing, but employment increases on impact, owing to the
increase in aggregate efficiency and the removal of the implicit output tax. Finally, the
bottom two panels of Figure 9 show that investment in both varieties and physical capital
overshoots initially, leading to a rapid increase in the economy’s two types of capital.
The last row of Table 4 above reports the welfare gains for the representative consumer
in consumption-equivalent units including the transition, i.e., these take into account the
deferred increase in consumption as investment builds up and the overshooting of employment
during the transition. We find that the representative consumer needs to be compensated
with an additional 7.5% consumption in each period in order for her to be indifferent between
the initial distorted steady state and the transition to the efficient steady state.
31

Figure 9: Transition to efficient allocation

5.2

Relative importance of each channel

We now decompose the overall gains into the three channels by which markups distort allocations, i.e., the aggregate markup, misallocation, and inefficient entry. We do this by
removing each of the three channels in isolation using offsetting subsidies. These subsidies
are financed by lump-sum taxes levied on the representative consumer. We view these experiments as simply isolating the role of each distortion and illustrating the welfare costs of
markups. The actual welfare consequences of such schemes would of course be much more
complex in economies with heterogeneous consumers and other frictions.
Removing aggregate markup. We first study the consequence of introducing a uniform
output subsidy χ for all producers that eliminates the aggregate markup distortion.
A firm’s profits in this environment are
πt (z) = max (1 + χ) pt (z)yt (z) − Pv,t vt (z),
pt (z)

and its optimal price is

Table 4 above reports the effect of introducing the output subsidy on the steady state
of our benchmark model. The subsidy increases output by 33%, consumption by 25%, and
employment by 16%. These increases are only slightly smaller than those from eliminating
all markup distortions. The key difference between the efficient allocation and the economy
with a uniform output subsidy is the lower efficiency E in the latter. This lower efficiency
reflects the continued presence of misallocation and the somewhat smaller mass of firms.
Figure 10 shows the transitional dynamics after the introduction of the uniform subsidy.
These transitions are very similar to when we remove all markups distortions, with one
important exception. Under the efficient allocation the planner chooses to increase overall
concentration, and does this by increasing the amount of investment in more productive firms
and reducing the amount of investment in less productive firms. This outcome cannot be
reproduced by a uniform output subsidy. Nevertheless, as the last row of Table 4 shows,
33

a uniform output subsidy that eliminates the aggregate markup increases welfare by 4.9%,
about two-thirds of the 7.5% total costs of markups.
Removing misallocation. We next consider size-dependent subsidies that equate the
marginal product of factors across firms but leave the aggregate markup unchanged. Table 4
shows that such subsidies would have a modest impact, increasing output by 3.2%, consumption by 4.1%, and employment by 0.6%. Aggregate efficiency increases by 1.7%, reflecting
both the removal of misallocation and the 3.2% increase in the mass of firms that results
from subsidies that disproportionately benefit high productivity firms. Overall, removing
misallocation increases welfare by 2.5%, about one-third of the total costs of markups.
Although the three channels we identify are not additive, taken together the aggregate
markup and the misallocation channels seem to account for the bulk of the costs of markups.
We now demonstrate that indeed the costs due to inefficient entry are quite small.
Subsidizing entry. We now consider a uniform subsidy χ that reduces the cost of creating

We calculate the gains from such a policy for many values of χ. We find that the largest
gains from such a policy occur when the entry subsidy is χ = 0.297 which causes the steady
state mass of firms to increase by 20.3%. Table 4 shows that this subsidy has a modest effect
on economic activity, increasing output by 4.5%, consumption by 6.3%, and employment by
3.4%. Aggregate efficiency increases by 3.4%, reflecting the increase in variety. But these
increases in economic activity do not lead to similarly-sized welfare gains. The welfare gains
from this entry subsidy are 0.7%, less then 1/10th of the total cost of markups. Larger entry
subsidies can actually backfire and reduce welfare. For example, a subsidy of χ = 0.69 that
increases the mass of firms by 50% would lead to a welfare loss of 0.2%. Such losses occur
when too much labor is allocated to variety creation as opposed to production.
Why are the welfare gains from entry subsidies so low? It turns out that increasing the
number of firms has virtually no effect on the aggregate markup or losses from misallocation.
Figure 11 illustrates the dynamics of the economy after the introduction of an entry subsidy
χ = 0.297 which increases the number of firms by 20.3%. The aggregate markup falls by a
tiny amount, from 1.150 to 1.149. Though aggregate efficiency increases, it does so entirely
due to love-of-variety effects, not due to a reduction in misallocation. Overall, the welfare
gains from such an entry subsidy are small because consumption must fall and employment
must rise to finance the increased investment in new firms.
34

Figure 11: Transitional dynamics with entry subsidy

The result that more competition does not decrease the aggregate markup may appear
counterintuitive but is, in fact, a robust result in a large class of models in the international
trade literature which have shown that the removal of trade costs (which subjects domestic
producers to more competition) leaves the markup distribution unchanged.15 To understand
this result, recall that the aggregate markup is a cost-weighted average of firm-level markups
µ(q). An increase in the number of firms has two effects on this weighted average. The direct
effect is a reduction in the relative quantity q and hence a reduction in the markups µ(q)
of each firm. But there is also an important compositional effect. Recall that in our model,
small firms face more elastic demand. This makes them more vulnerable to competition
from entrants. By contrast large firms face less elastic demand and are less vulnerable to
competition from entrants. A entry subsidy that increases the number of firms causes small,
low markup firms to contract by more than large, high markup firms and the resulting
reallocation means high markup firms get relatively more weight in the aggregate markup
calculation. In our model, this offsetting compositional effect is almost exactly as large as the
direct effect so that overall the aggregate markup falls by a negligible amount. We develop
this argument more formally in Appendix C.

15

See Bernard, Eaton, Jensen and Kortum (2003) and Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson and Rodrı́guez-Clare
(2017) who show that the markup distribution is invariant to changes in trade costs in models where variable
markups arise due to limit pricing and monopolistic competition with non-CES demand, respectively.

35

Figure 12: Effect of entry subsidy on markups

We illustrate the two offsetting effects in Figure 12. For visual clarity, we consider an
extreme parameterization in which we choose the entry subsidy large enough to triple the
number of firms. Notice in the left panel that markups fall for all firms when the number
of firms increases. The right panel shows that the most efficient firms lose only about 5%
of their employment. By contrast, the least efficient firms contract their employment by a
lot more and indeed some find it optimal to shut down altogether. Though we have derived
this result in a quite specific model of monopolistic competition, in our robustness section
below we show that similar conclusions are reached in an alternative model of oligopolistic
competition calibrated to match the same concentration facts.
Welfare results for our alternative ‘high M’ calibration. We have also calculated
the welfare costs of markups in our alternative calibration that targets an aggregate markup
of M = 1.25, as in the Compustat data. Not surprisingly, since the aggregate markup is
larger the distorted steady state is much further from the efficient steady state. As reported
in Table 5, in the efficient steady state output is higher by 67.6%, consumption by 56.8%,
and employment by 26.3% relative to the high M steady state. The total welfare costs of
markups are correspondingly larger. The representative consumer needs to be compensated
with an additional 18.6% consumption in each period in order for her to be indifferent between
the high M steady state and the transition to the efficient steady state. In this sense, the
total welfare costs of markups are more than twice as large in the M economy as in our
benchmark. The high M economy has both larger and more dispersed markups than the
benchmark, but we again find that it is the aggregate markup itself that accounts for most
of the welfare costs. A 25% uniform output subsidy that eliminates the aggregate markup
increases welfare by 15.2%, more than four-fifths of the 18.6% total costs of markups in this

alternative calibration. In other words, the aggregate markup channel is even more important
in this alternative calibration than it is in our benchmark. Removing misallocation increases
welfare by 3%, slightly higher than in our benchmark. Again we find that, taken together,
the aggregate markup and misallocation channels account for almost all the costs of markups.

5.3

Explaining the rise in markups

So far we have focused on our model’s normative implications. But given the pronounced
rise in markups observed in US data over recent decades, it is worth asking if our model can
shed light on this phenomenon.
Problem with the barriers to entry story. One explanation for the rise in markups is
a rise in entry barriers and a resulting decline in competition.16 Our model casts doubt on
this explanation. In our model, a rise in entry barriers of this kind would counterfactually
reduce concentration by shifting production to less efficient firms that can now survive due to
less intense competition. And moreover this reallocation of production towards less efficient
firms would leave the aggregate markup essentially unchanged, despite an increase in firmlevel markups, because of the compositional effects illustrated in Figure 12 above.
Given that an increase in entry barriers cannot explain the patterns in the data, what are
the forces that could potentially rationalize the observed increase in markups? We briefly
consider two other possible explanations: (i) a decline in antitrust enforcement, as emphasized
16

See Grullon, Larkin and Michaely (2017) and Gutiérrez and Phillippon (2017) for discussion.

37

Figure 13: Effect of size-dependent investment taxes

by Peltzman (2014) and Grullon, Larkin and Michaely (2017) and others, and (ii) production technologies that are more intensive in intangible capital and hence more scalable, as
emphasized by Haskel and Westlake (2017).
Decline in antitrust enforcement. A detailed model of mergers and acquisitions is beyond the scope of this paper. We model the effects of antitrust policy in a simple reduced-form
way. Specifically, we view antitrust policy as a schedule of size-dependent investment taxes.
Our interpretation of a reduction in the enforcement of antitrust policy is then a decline in
the progressivity of these size-dependent investment taxes which disproportionately benefits
large, high markup firms and increases markups and concentration.
To this end, let T (x) denote the tax paid by a firm that wants to invest x with
T (x) = τ0 x1+τ1 − x.
The firm’s tax-inclusive expenditure is then τ0 x1+τ1 . Here the parameter τ1 determines the
progressivity of the tax with a positive τ1 implying higher marginal taxes for larger firms,
while τ0 determines the average tax rate. Clearly, a progressive tax schedule disproportionately hurts larger, more productive firms. Indeed, the investment choices in this economy
are proportional to

 1
q(e) 1+ητ1
x(e) ∼
,
e
and therefore scale less with productivity than they would in the absence of taxes. Figure 13
shows that when τ1 is positive, both capital and the amount firms sell become less dispersed.
To illustrate the effects of these taxes, we choose τ1 = 0.80 which reduces the sales share
of the top 1% of firms from 0.30 in our benchmark to 0.18. This corresponds to the 60%
increase in the top 1% sales share in the Compustat data from 1980 to 2012. We set τ0 = 0.61
to keep the capital-to-output ratio K/Y unchanged relative to our benchmark model.

Table 6 compares the steady states in the two economies, one with 1980 levels of concentration and size-dependent investment taxes, the other our benchmark model with 2012
levels of concentration but without size-dependent investment taxes. Returning the economy
to 1980 levels of concentration in this way would reduce the aggregate markup, from 1.15 to
1.12. This is a much larger effect than the entry subsidy we discuss above. But the reduction
in the aggregate markup comes at a considerable cost. The losses from misallocation are now
9.3%, much larger than the 1.2% in our benchmark. Consequently, aggregate efficiency in
the economy falls by 4%, despite a 22% increase in the mass of firms. Output is lower by
11% and consumption is lower by 21% despite a 9% increase in employment.
Overall we find that policies to limit concentration can be costly. Even though they
succeed in reducing the level of markups, especially at the top, they result in considerable
misallocation across firms thereby generating large efficiency losses. Empirically, this also
suggests that if the rise in concentration and markups observed in recent US data is due to
a reduction in, say, antitrust enforcement, then it may be the case that the overall level of
markups rose yet at the same time misallocation fell. This is admittedly speculative, but is
consistent with Baqaee and Farhi (2018) who document that the increase in concentration
and markups in the US has been accompanied by an improvement in allocative efficiency.

Intangible capital and scalability. Recently Haskel and Westlake (2017) have argued
that the advent of technologies that are intensive in intangible capital — in design, branding,
R&D, etc — have made production technologies more scalable. One simple interpretation
of this idea is that production functions are beginning to exhibit less diminishing returns to
scale. This means that a given amount of dispersion in productivity will generate a larger
amount of dispersion in output and hence in markups. This argument suggest an alternative,
technological, interpretation of the simultaneous rise in concentration and markups to go
along side a decline in antitrust enforcement. Still, regardless of whether the simultaneous
rise in concentration and markups is due to changes in technology, changes in regulation, or
some mix of the two, our key point is that it may be costly to undo these changes. Sizedependent policies that reduce concentration in an attempt to bring down the overall level of
markups do so at the cost of increasing misallocation and reducing aggregate productivity.

Robustness

In this section we consider a number of robustness checks designed to assess the sensitivity
of our results to parameter choices and other assumptions.

6.1

Estimates of super-elasticity ε for narrower NAICS industries

In our benchmark model we assume the same productivity dispersion parameter ξ and superelasticity ε for each industry. We now relax this assumption by estimating these two parameters for narrower sets of NAICS industries. Our first set excludes the finance, education,
and religion industries. As Table 7 shows, excluding these industries has hardly any effect on
our estimated parameters or the implied amount of misallocation. Our second set excludes
in addition those industries that feature more “local” competition, namely health, accommodation and food. Again we find that the Pareto tail ξ is close to our benchmark but
now the super-elasticity ε is slightly higher at 2.43. This slightly higher ε leads to slightly
larger losses from misallocation, 1.3% up from our benchmark 1.2%. Our third set includes
manufacturing only. Since the wage bill in manufacturing is much less concentrated than the
top sales share for manufacturing, we now estimate a distinctly higher ε = 4.54 with losses
from misallocation rising to 1.9%. Still, the bottom line is that the losses from misallocation
implied by variable markups are relatively small.

6.2

Estimates of super-elasticity ε from Taiwanese micro data

We now estimate the ratio ε/σ using a rich product-level panel dataset from Taiwanese
manufacturing industries that we previously studied in Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2015).

The Taiwanese manufacturing data is more detailed than the 6-digit NAICS data and allows
us to control for any product-year specific effects that capture sectoral differences.
For this exercise, we use the Klenow-Willis specification of the Kimball aggregator to
derive the relationship between a producer’s markup µi and its sales pi yi , namely


1
1
ε
(41)
+ log 1 −
= constant + log(pi yi )
µi
µi
σ
The key idea is that if we had measures of the markups µi so that the LHS of this expression
is known then the ratio ε/σ can be estimated as the slope coefficient in a regression on
sales. To implement this, we follow the methodology of De Loecker and Warzynski (2012)
to construct estimates of producer level markups µi . In particular, we estimate an industryspecific production function from which we can infer the markup from the producer’s cost
minimization problem based on one of the variable inputs. The inverse markup is then
calculated as the variable input share adjusted for the estimated factor output elasticity.
We then estimate equation (41) above in two ways. In the first specification we simply
exploit the cross-sectional variation of producers within a given product category by including
product-year fixed effects. This gives an estimate of ε/σ = 0.15 that is tightly estimated with
a standard error of 0.002. In the second specification we exploit the panel structure of the data
and include a producer fixed effect, thus using the time-series comovement of a producer’s
sales and their markups to identify the super-elasticity. This gives an estimate of ε/σ = 0.16
with a standard error of 0.007. Reassuringly, both of these estimates are fairly close to our
benchmark estimate of 0.189 from the 6-digit NAICS data.

41

6.3

Dotsey-King specification of the Kimball aggregator

In our benchmark model we use the specification of the Kimball aggregator proposed by
Klenow and Willis (2016). A popular alternative is the specification proposed by Dotsey and
King (2005) which can be written
Υ(q) =

κ
1
1
(1 + ζ)q − ζ) + 1 −
(1 + ζ)κ
(1 + ζ)κ

where to ensure concavity of the aggregator we need the two parameters ζ and κ to be such
that (1 + ζ)(1 − κ) > 0. Both specifications have two parameters, one which controls the
average demand elasticity and the other which controls the super-elasticity. In slight abuse
of notation, let σ(q) denote the demand elasticity and let ε(q) denote the super-elasticity as
functions of relative size. For the Klenow-Willis specification these are σ(q) = σ q −ε/σ and
ε(q) = ε q −ε/σ so that σ(1) = σ and ε(1) = ε. For the Dotsey-King specification these are
σ(q) =

(1 + ζ)q − ζ
1
(1 + ζ)(1 − κ)
q

and
ε(q) = −

1
ζ
(1 + ζ)(1 − κ) q

We calibrate the three key parameters, namely the Pareto tail parameter ξ and the DotseyKing parameters ζ and κ using the same strategy as for our benchmark model. Matching
our target moments requires ξ = 6.69, ζ = −0.54 and κ = 0.82. This value of the Pareto
tail parameter ξ = 6.69 is very close to our benchmark estimate of 6.66, suggesting that
the amount of productivity dispersion needed to match the concentration in the data is not
very sensitive to the details of the aggregator. The values ζ = −0.54 and κ = 0.82 for
the Dotsey-King aggregator give point demand elasticity σ(1) = 11.64, again very close to
the point demand elasticity σ = 11.55 in our Klenow-Willis benchmark, suggesting that the
average demand elasticity needed to match an aggregate markup of 1.15 is again not very
sensitive to the details of the aggregator. By contrast, the point super-elasticity is given by
ε(1)/σ(1) = 0.54, higher than our benchmark estimate of 0.189 and more in line with our
alternative ‘high ε/σ’ calibration above.17
We report the results from this experiment in Table 8. The fit to the distribution of relative sales is slightly worse than our benchmark specification, in particular the match to the
top end of the distribution is worse. This is one reason why we prefer our benchmark KlenowWillis specification. The implied distribution of markups is very similar to our benchmark
except at the very top. For example, the 99th cost-weighted percentile of markups is 1.37 in
17

Note that these estimates of the ε/σ ratio from US concentration data are much lower than is typically
used in macro models that assume a representative firm. For example, Sbordone (2010) uses a ε/σ ratio of
2 or 3 and Dotsey and King (2005) use a ratio of 6. By contrast, all of our estimates are substantially below
1 and imply much milder real rigidities at the firm level.

42

our benchmark but is 1.23 with the Dotsey-King specification. The losses from misallocation
are now about 1.7%, up just slightly from our benchmark loss of 1.2% but somewhat lower
than the 2.1% loss from our alternative ‘high ε/σ’ calibration of the Klenow-Willis specification that is arguably a better point of comparison. We conclude from this that our finding
of misallocation losses that are small relative to the existing literature is not driven by the
particular details of the Klenow-Willis specification and is a robust implication of the US
concentration data viewed through the lens of a model with endogenously variable markups.
We also find that doubling the number of competitors has negligible effects on the aggregate
markup and the amount of misallocation, again consistent with our benchmark results.

6.4

Oligopolistic competition

We now present calculations based on the oligopolistic competition model of Atkeson and
Burstein (2008) that we used in Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2015). In this model there is
a continuum of sectors aggregated by a CES technology with elasticity θ and then within
each sector there is a finite N firms that are aggregated with another CES technology with
elasticity γ > θ and these N firms engage in Cournot competition. We use a simplified version
of Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2015) with one country, symmetric sectors (no systematic
productivity differences between sectors, an identical number of firms per sector), and without
fixed operating costs. We assume that each firm receives an IID productivity draw from a
Pareto distribution with tail parameter ξ. We fix N = 1100, the median number of firms in
the 6-digit NAICS data, and calibrate the three key parameters γ, θ and ξ using the same
strategy as for our benchmark model. Matching our target moments requires γ = 10.25,
θ = 0.46, and ξ = 8.64. The demand elasticity facing each firm is a (harmonic) weighted
average of γ and θ, namely

−1
1
1
ε(si ) = si + (1 − si )
θ
γ
where si is the sales share of firm i = 1, ..., N in its sector.
We report the results in Table 8. The model fits the lower end of the distribution of
relative sales worse than our benchmark, but it matches the top of the distribution well.18
The distribution of markups predicted by the two models is similar, except at the very top.
For example, the 99th cost-weighted percentile of markups is 1.37 in our benchmark and 1.50
in the model with oligopolistic competition. Intuitively, with a finite number of producers
in any given industry there is a small set of sectors in which the largest firm is much more
productive than the remaining competitors and charges very high markups. Owing to these
higher markups at the very top, the Atkeson-Burstein model predicts more misallocation
than our benchmark, 2.89% as opposed to 1.2%.
18

A richer specification of the productivity distribution allows us to fit the data nearly as well as in our
benchmark model and implies nearly identical results, so we omit it for brevity.

Now consider the effect of increasing competition in this model. Doubling the number of
firms in each sector only reduces the aggregate markup from 1.15 to 1.146 and only reduces
the misallocation losses from 2.89% to 2.88%. Thus, as in our benchmark model, more
competition does not alleviate the key source of losses from markups. We have also solved
for equilibria in versions of the model with Bertrand competition in which goods sold by
producers that belong to a given sector are perfect substitutes so that the most productive
firm engages in limit pricing and charges a markup that depends on the second-best producer’s
costs. We found that our results are robust to this extension as well, with implied losses from
misallocation on the order of 2%. We thus conclude that our results key are robust to these
alternative settings with oligopolistic competition. Solving for the dynamic equilibrium and
the welfare costs of markups in these settings is computationally impractical because of the
very high dimensionality of the state-space, but it is reassuring that our key steady-state
implications are robust to these other market structures.

Conclusion

We study the welfare costs of product market distortions in a dynamic model with heterogeneous firms and endogenously variable markups. We calibrate the model to match the
amount of concentration observed in US industry in 2012. We find that the welfare costs
of markups are large. For our benchmark calibration, the representative consumer would
gain 7.5% in consumption-equivalent terms if all markup distortions were eliminated, once
transitional dynamics are taken into account. In our model markups reduce welfare because
the aggregate markup distortion acts like a uniform output tax and reduces employment and
investment by all firms, because markup variation across firms causes misallocation of factors
of production, and because there is an inefficiently low rate of entry due to the misalignment
between private and social incentives to create new firms. We find that the aggregate markup
accounts for about two-thirds of the total welfare costs in our benchmark model, misallocation
accounts for about one-third, and the costs due to inefficient entry are negligible.
Although we focus on the normative implications of our model, our results also have clear
empirical implications. One simple but important finding is that the overall level of markups
is best measured as a cost-weighted average of firm-level markups. This is the relevant
aggregate distortion to employment and investment decisions. By contrast a revenue-weighted
average of firm-level markups, as used in the existing literature, overstates the rise in the
overall level of market power. In addition, our results provide two reasons to be skeptical of
explanations for the simultaneous rise in concentration and markups that focus on increasing
barriers to entry. First, in our model increasing barriers to entry reduce concentration, because
the resulting lack of competition makes it easier for small firms to survive. Second, in our
model changes in entry have negligible effects on the overall level of markups because entry

45

is associated with a reallocation of production towards high productivity, high markup firms.
Reductions in antitrust enforcement or increases in the scalability of production may
provide better explanations for the rise in concentration and markups. But whatever the
underlying cause, our key conclusion is that size-dependent policies aimed at reducing concentration and markups need to be viewed with caution. While such policies can reduce
the overall level of markups, they can also greatly increase misallocation and thereby reduce
aggregate productivity.

Appendix
A

Cost-weighted vs. sales-weighted average markups

The aggregate markup can be written as either a cost-weighted arithmetic average of firm-level markups or
a sales-weighted harmonic average of firm-level markups. To see this simply, consider a special case of our
model where labor is the only variable input so that a firm with productivity z produces y = zlη . Since price
is a markup over marginal cost we have

1/η
y(z)
1
p(z) = µ(z) W
z
y(z)
Hence we can write the firm’s wage share as
W l(z)
η
=
p(z)y(z)
µ(z)
As in the main text, the aggregate markup M is implicitly defined by the aggregate labor share
W L̃
η
=
Y
M
where L̃ denotes aggregate labor used in production. Hence we can write the sales shares
p(z)y(z)
µ(z) l(z)
(A1)
=
Y
M L̃
R
Now let the distribution of productivity be H(z). Since Y = p(z)y(z) dH(z) we can integrate both sides of
(A1) and rearrange to get
Z
l(z)
M = µ(z)
dH(z)
L̃
which expresses the aggregate markup as an arithmetic average of the firm-level markups µ(z) with cost
weights l(z)/L̃. Equation (28) in the main text is simply this formula but for our more general model where
both labor and materials are variable inputs. Alternatively, re-write (A1) as
p(z)y(z) M
l(z)
=
Y
µ(z)
L̃
Since L̃ =

R

(A2)

l(z) dH(z) we can integrate both sides and rearrange to get
−1
Z
1 p(z)y(z)
dH(z)
M=
µ(z)
Y

which expresses the aggregate markup as a harmonic average of µ(z) with sales weights p(z)y(z)/Y .
These calculations do not depend on the details of the demand system or market structure. In particular,
they do not on the assumption of Kimball demand and monopolistic competition. In Edmond, Midrigan and
Xu (2015) we obtained equivalent formulas in the Atkeson-Burstein model with oligopolistic competition.

planner’s problem is to maximize (33) subject to (34) and (35). Let λ∗1,t and λ∗2,t denote the multipliers on
these constraints. The planner’s first order condition for Mt∗ can then be written

Why entry has negligible effect on aggregate markup

In this appendix we show why increasing the number of competitors has a negligible effect on the aggregate
markup in our model, a result that is analogous to findings in the trade literature, especially the work
of Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2017). They study a model with monopolistic
competition and variable markups with more general non-CES demand which nest the Kimball aggregator
we use. We adopt their approach to calculating the response of the aggregate markup M to a marginal
change in the number of firms. To this end, note that a firm’s employment l(e) is proportional to its relative
quantity scaled by productivity, q(e)/e, so we can write the aggregate markup as
R∞
µ(q(e)) q(e) dG(e)
M = 1 R ∞ q(e) e
e dG(e)
1

47

where the limits of the integral use our assumption that G(e) is Pareto on [1, ∞). Using the optimal steady
state investment choice x(e) we can express the optimality condition that determines a firm’s relative size
Υ0 (q) = µ(q)

1
,
Ae

where A > 0 is a scalar that depends on the aggregate demand index D and the cost of the variable input
Pv . Since the latter changes as we increase the number of producers, so does the scalar A. In particular,
A0 (N ) < 0 so that competition effectively increases all firms’ variable costs.
This optimality condition clearly shows that a firm’s quantity choice is a function of the product Ae,
not of e and A in isolation. We can then use a change of variables ẽ = Ae and the assumption that G(e) is
Pareto to write the aggregate markup as
R∞
µ(q(ẽ)) q(ẽ) dG(ẽ)
.
M = A R ∞ q(ẽ) ẽ
ẽ dG(ẽ)
A
Hence changes in the number of competitors, summarized by changes in A, only change the aggregate markup
through their effect on the markups of the smallest firms. A direct calculation then gives
q(A)g(A) A0 (N )
M0 (N ) = − (µ(q(A)) − M)) R ∞ q(ẽ)
≤0
A
ẽ dG(ẽ)
A
Since the markups of the smallest firms, µ(q(A)), are lower than the aggregate markup, M, an increase in
the number of firms reduces the aggregate markup. But this effect is quantitatively small in our calibration
since q(A)g(A) is relatively small because the smallest firms sell very little. Thus, even though we do not
assume a choke price, as Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2017) do in deriving their
exact neutrality result, our quantitative results are very similar.
