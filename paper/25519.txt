ABSTRACT
We evaluate the properties of mean reversion and mean aversion in asset prices and returns as
commonly characterized in the finance literature. The study is undertaken within a class of wellknown dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models and shows that the mean reversion/
aversion distinction is largely artificial. We then propose an alternative measure, the ‘Average
Crossing Time’ that both unifies these concepts and provides an alternative characterization.
Ceteris paribus, mean reverting processes have a relatively shorter average crossing time as
compared to mean averting processes.

1. Introduction
There has been a long-standing debate in the asset pricing literature as to
whether time series of equity and bonds returns are ‘mean reverting’ or ‘mean
averting’. While the conventional wisdom is that the former returns are mean
reverting and the latter mean averting, the issue is by no means settled.1 The
debate has also diffused to the predictability literature. The implicit underlying
belief in predictability studies is that the predicting variables (dividend-price
ratios, earnings-price ratios) follow stationary processes that revert to some
unspecified normal value (the mean of the process). As Campbell and Shiller
(2001) put it: “It seems reasonable to suspect that prices are not likely ever to
drift too far from their normal levels relative to indicators of fundamental value,
… when stock prices are very high relative to these indicators, then prices will
eventually fall in the future to bring the ratios back to more normal historical
levels”. Intuitively, a mean reverting process captures this property: above
average values of the stochastic process must regularly be followed by below
average values and vice-versa. Conversely, mean aversion intuitively suggests
that the stochastic process drifts away from its mean and implies that mean
aversion is unlikely to be a characteristic of a stationary time series. We show
that this intuition is misleading.

1

There is a plethora of empirical studies on mean reversion in stock prices at various time
horizons. See for example, papers by Summers (1986), Campbell and Mankiw (1987), Fama and
French (1988), Lo and MacKinlay (1988) and Poterba and Summers (1988). Others, most notably
Kim, Nelson and Startz (1991) and Richardson and Stock (1989) have challenged some of their
conclusions. See also the conflicting perspectives in, e.g., Lewellen (2004), Torous et al. (2004),
and Campbell and Yogo (2006) versus Goyal and Welch (2003), Welch and Goyal (2008) and
Bossaerts and Hillion (1999). Other important work includes Cochrane(2011), Kim and Nelson
(1998), Bessembinder et al. (1995) and Daniel (2001). Zakamulin (2015), provided an excellent
summary of this literature and explores the evidence for mean reversion and predictability over
periods exceeding ten years.

There are at least four characterizations of mean reversion in the finance
literature and it is our intention to evaluate their relationship vis-à-vis the above
intuition. Multiple characterizations of mean reversion (aversion) have arisen, in
part, because the empirical literature is hampered by the insufficiency of financial
time series of data for discriminating statistical tests. We sidestep this issue by
considering stochastic model economies that allow the generation of arbitrarily
long return series. Specifically, we call into service several widely used dynamic
production-based macro-finance models, where the time series of security prices
and their returns are stationary by construction, and explore the extent to which
they satisfy these various characterizations. A key finding for these models is that
the measures of mean reversion/aversion used in the literature classify some of
these series as mean reverting and others as mean averting.
Negative (positive) autocorrelation in financial return series, for example,
is sometimes cited as the identifying characteristic of mean reversion (aversion)
and we adopt it as our benchmark property. In particular, this identifying
characteristic classifies the stationary time series characterizing equity returns as
‘mean reverting’ yet the stationary time series characterizing bond returns is
mean averting (a result consistent with conventional understanding) in the case
of the simplest baseline equilibrium model. This result demonstrates that mean
reversion, as defined by the benchmark property, is not unique to the
phenomenon that ‘above average values of stochastic process must regularly be
followed by below average values and vice-versa’ since mean averting time series
are equally consistent with this characterization. We later show that more
realistic macroeconomic versions of the model generically display benchmark
mean aversion in all financial time series, whether equity or debt, a result that
leads us to question the usefulness of that characterization.
In this paper we propose an alternative measure, “Average Crossing Time”
(ACT) to characterize mean reversion/aversion. We argue that it provides not
only a more useful measure of the degree of mean reversion/aversion, but also a
3

more intuitive sense of one time series being ‘more strongly meanreverting/averting’ than another. It also allows us to rank existing
characterizations of mean reversion according to how restrictive their measure of
mean reversion actually is.
As its name suggests, the ACT measures the average number of periods in
the evolution of a discrete time stochastic process that the process is strictly
above or below its mean value. Broadly speaking, mean reverting processes have
a relatively shorter average crossing time as compared to mean averting ones.
Using the ACT measure we explore the antecedent probability structures behind
the traditional notions of mean reversion and aversion. We identify the properties
of the ACT measure and compare them with the traditional autocorrelation
measures for the class of macroeconomic models referred to above. Our analysis is
both analytical and computational, with the latter consisting of wide-ranging
numerical simulations.
An outline of the paper is as follows: In section 2 we identify four
definitions of mean reversion and mean aversion found in the literature, and
partially characterize their interrelationships. In Section 3, these definitions are
applied to the analysis of a simple baseline dynamic macroeconomic model.2 The
ACT characterization of “mean reversion” is introduced in Section 4. In Section 5
we add additional features to the Baseline model and study the resulting
implications for the strength of mean reversion/aversion in model-generated
2

The primary intellectual antecedents of the present study are Basu and Vinod (1994), Cecchetti
et al. (1990), Guvenen (2009), and Lansing (2015). In a Lucas (1978) style exchange model where
dividends follow a Markov switching regime (see Hamilton (1989)), Cecchetti et al. (1990) are
able to replicate the observed patterns of mean reversion measures at various horizons. Guvenen
(2009) explores asset pricing in a model where firm owners and workers have differential access to
securities markets: firm owners trade both equity and default free bonds while workers are limited
to bond trading. Lansing (2015) explores the asset pricing consequences of variation in factor
shares. Both report slight negative correlation in equity returns based on data, and as equilibrium
outcomes of their models. We note that the analysis in Basu and Vinod (1994) explores some of
the same issues and motivates the present study. None of these studies, however, explores the
fundamental information being conveyed by the mean reversion / aversion property, but rather
focus on identifying this property in model generated return series.

data by computing empirical autocorrelations and ACTs for prominent financial
return series while Section 7 concludes.

2. Mean Reversion
The empirical finance literature proposes multiple characterizations of
“mean reversion.” In the discussion below we examine these alternate
characterizations and explore their interrelationships. They are as follows,
expressed in terms of an arbitrary stationary stochastic process {x!t } .
A stationary stochastic process {x!t } is said to be mean reverting if and
only if:
I.
II.

cov (x!t , x!t+1 ) < 0
var (x!t + x!t+1 +. . . + x!t+j )
j +1

(1)
< var x!t , for any j ≥ 1.

(2)

Property I is cited by Guvenen (2009) and Lansing (2015). An early
proponent of Property II is Summers (1986). Property II is also used in Poterba
and Summers (1988) and Mukherji (2011) for their discussions of mean reversion
in stock price and rate of return series.3
The relationship between Properties I and II is captured in Proposition
2.1.
Proposition 2.1: Let {x!t } be a stationary, mean reverting, stochastic
process with an ergodic probability distribution. With respect to that
distribution, statistical properties I and II detailed above are related according to
a)

II ⇒ I

3

Property II stands in specific contrast to the analogous property of a random walk where
var (x!t + x!t−1 +. . . + x!t+j −1 ) = j var (x!t ) .

I ⇒ II. 4

Proof: See the Technical Appendix.
Condition (3) captures the idea that a process displays strong comovement
in adjacent elements but that the effect diminishes very rapidly for series
elements progressively in the future.
The significance of Proposition 2.1, simple as it is, lies in Part a): if the
financial series generated by a particular model fails to satisfy Property I, it will
fail to satisfy Property II as well. In this sense Property II is a more restrictive
criterion than Property I. For this reason we focus on assessing how restrictive
Property I actually is, knowing that Property II is even more so. In fact, they
will be shown by the ACT measure to be so strikingly restrictive that it is not
surprising to find they are not robustly satisfied in data.
III.

For any time integers 0 ≤ r < s < t < u ,
cov (x s − x r , x u − x t ) < 0 .

(4)

Property III, to our knowledge first proposed in Exley et al. (2004), is a
comment about sequential changes in the values of the stochastic process {x!t }
rather than a statement about the statistical properties of the values themselves.
Interpreting x!t as p!te , the price of equity (capital) at time t, Property III suggests
that increases in the price of equity over a particular interval of time will
generally be followed by reductions in the price in future time intervals. As such,
it represents a sense of mean reversion different from Properties I and II. In all of

4

For mean aversion the connections of Proposition 2.1 are reversed. Using the notation of
Proposition 2.1 they are:
a) I ⇒ II

the characterizations we consider, if the identifying inequality is reversed, the
series is said to be mean averting.
Property III can be guaranteed if certain sufficient conditions are satisfied.
For any time integers h > 0, k > 0 , define v (h −k ) as:
v (h −k ) ≡ var (x!h − x!k )
This allows a simple statement of the following proposition:
Proposition 2.2: If v ( ) is concave then {x!t } is mean reverting by
Property III.5
Proof: See Exley et al. (2004).
If condition (4) were not satisfied, then increases in the value of the series
would, on average, be followed by further increases and declines by further
declines. Accordingly, the range of possible evolutions of a series would tend to
fan out with the variance of the difference exploding as the difference in time
indices grew, as in a random walk. Concavity of v ( ) precludes this effect:
increases in 𝑥"# must be followed, on average, by eventual decreases and vice
versa, a weak sense of mean reversion.
Property III is rarely employed in the empirical finance literature, and, as
we demonstrate later, neither implies nor is it implied by either Property I or II.
We will thus largely focus on Properties I and II since they are the most
frequently cited.

where Et is the period t conditional expectations operator, x is the

Property IV identifies a mean reverting process as one that is always being
“pulled towards its mean”: if, at some t, the process is above its mean (x t > x ) ,
the expected change next period should be negative and vice versa, with the
“strength” of the pull-back determined by κ and the extent of the current
deviation ⎡⎢x t − x ⎤⎥ . Of all the characterizations of mean reversion this is the most
⎣
⎦
intuitively obvious.
As noted in the introduction, the notion of mean reversion is one of aboveaverage realizations of the series being regularly followed by below-average values
and vice versa. Which of the above properties is consistent with this intuition?
Are the properties consistent with one another? To what extent do they refine
the basic concept of stationarity?7 Since the context of these questions is one of
equilibrium economic and financial time series, we choose to address them first
within the framework of the simplest stochastic general equilibrium
macroeconomic model.

3. Modeling Perspective and the Baseline Paradigm
We first focus on a simple representative agent neoclassical stochastic
macroeconomic model with “planning” representation:
As regards these questions, we can get an indication of the answer by looking at the simplest
“canonical mean reverting process”, an AR(1):
x!t+1 = ρx t + ε!t+1, 0 < ρ < 1, ε!t ~ N(0, σε!2 ) for all t

7

For this process, cov (x!t , x!t+1 ) = ρσx2 which is mean averting by Property I. Furthermore, since

it is not mean reverting by Property II, confirming Proposition 2.1. As for Property III,

) = 0, for all r < s < t < u;

hence the process is also not Property III mean reverting. Lastly,
Et (!
x t+1 − x t ) = Et ((ρ −1)x t + ε!t+1 ) = (ρ −1)(x t − x ) , since

x = 0.

An AR(1) process is set up trivially to satisfy Property IV.

Adopting the customary notation, u (ct , 1 −nt ) represents the representative
agent’s period utility function defined over his period t consumption ct and
leisure, (1 – nt ), where nt is labor supplied, f (kt , nt )λt denotes the representative
firm’s CRS production function of capital stock kt and labor supplied with {λ!t }
the stochastic total factor productivity shock. The probability distribution
function for {λ!t+1 } conditional on λt is denoted G (λt+1; λt ) and is assumed to be
known to the representative agent.8 Lastly, β denotes the representative agent’s
subjective time discount factor and Ω the period depreciation rate.
As the notation suggests, the state variables for this economy are kt and

λt . Under standard assumptions, problem (6) has a solution:
(i) continuous, time-invariant consumption ct = c (kt , λt ) , investment
it = i (kt , λt ) and labor service nt = n (kt , λt ) functions exist that solve problem

As a result the stochastic processes

governing investment, i (kt , λt ) , consumption, c (kt , λt ) , labor service, n (kt , λt ) and

(

)

output yt = y kt, n (kt , λt ) λt are also stationary. The same investment and
consumption functions arising as the solution to (6) coincide with the aggregate
investment and consumption functions arising from an analogous decentralized
market economy in recursive competitive equilibrium, a fact well known to the
literature; see, e.g., Prescott and Mehra (1980), or Brock (1982).
These decentralization schemes for (6) may be generalized to
accommodate an implied financial market where risk free debt and equity are
competitively traded.11 Under this expanded interpretation, the period t dividend
satisfies
dt = f (kt ,nt )λt − wtnt − it

(7)

while the ex-dividend aggregate equity price, pte = pe (kt ,λt ) , is identified with
next period’s capital stock:

Our notion of (strong) stationarity for a discrete time Markov process

{x t } is

as follows: let s, t

be arbitrary time indices and X the state space with x̂ ∈ X , and B ⊆ X, B a subset.
Define P (s, x̂, t, B ) = Prob (x ∈ B; x = x̂ ) . Then for any integer u,

All the stochastic processes analyzed in this article are Markov, stationary and possess unique
invariant distributions defined on compact sets.
10
The details behind these assertions can be found in the literature. Part (i) is entirely standard.
As for part (ii), the stochastic kernel, the expression P (s, x̂, t, B ) in footnote 3 can be shown to be
increasing, order reversing and to satisfy the “Feller Property.” By Theorem 3.2 in Kamihigashi
and Stachurski (2014) a unique stationary probability distribution exists with the indicated
properties.
11
As such, the financial market can be regarded as “complete.”

As continuous bounded functions of the economy’s state variables, pe (kt ,λt ),
pb (kt , λt ) , r e (kt , λt ) , r b (kt , λt ) and rtp (kt , λt ) are also stationary stochastic
processes.

3.1. The Baseline Model
We first restrict problem (6) by requiring that:
u (ct ) = ℓn (ct ) , yt = f (kt , nt )λ!t = k!tαλ!t , nt ≡ 1, Ω = 1

(11)

12

In a related study, Lansing (2015) refers to this dividend expression as the “macroeconomic
dividend.” With this identification the dividend is assumed to be exclusively financed out of
capital’s income share.

(17)

With {λ!t } an i.i.d. process, Hopenhayn and Prescott (1992) have shown that the
derived stochastic process on capital stock is stationary and that there exists a
corresponding ergodic probability distribution which captures its long run
behavior; the same can thus be said for pte , ptb and dt .
We first explore this model with reference to Property I.
Proposition 3.1: In model (6) specialized as per identifications (11) and

(12), the equity price p!te , the default-free bond price p!tb
series {d!t } are all mean averting by Property I.15
Proof: See the Technical Appendix.

This result confirms that the notions of Property I mean reversion and
stationarity (the existence of a long run ergodic probability distribution on
capital stock – the equity price – to which the economy converges) are not

equivalent, and that the distinction arises in the simplest equilibrium
macroeconomic models.
Corollary 3.1 Dividends, equity prices and default-free debt prices are
mean averting under Property II.
Proof: A consequence of Proposition 2.1 (see footnote 5).
Furthermore, these observations are generic in the sense expressed in the
following result:
Proposition 3.2: Consider any equilibrium model of the general form (6)
for which the equilibrium investment function i (kt , λt ) is continuous and
increasing in both its arguments. Suppose also that the period t price of equity
and the period t+1 level of the capital stock coincide (no costs of adjustment).

Proof: See the Technical Appendix. ■

Most of the macroeconomic models to be considered in this paper satisfy
the conditions of the above proposition. Hence the results in Proposition 3.2
apply quite generally.
We next examine mean reversion (Property I) in the equity and bond
return series for this model.
Proposition 3.3: For Model (6), specialized by (11) and (12):

Proof: See the Technical Appendix.

13

It is clear (see the Proof of Proposition 3.3) that the concavity of the
production function (α −1) < 0 plays the key role in inducing mean reversion (as
characterized by Property I) in equity returns, a fact first observed in Basu and
Vinod (1994). Risk-free returns, however, are mean averting.
Taken together, Propositions 3.1 and 3.3 remind us that mean reversion
in equity returns need not imply mean reversion in equity prices (at least by the
criterion of Property I).16 That mean reversion in returns is compatible with
mean aversion in prices is already well known (Spierdijk and Bikker (2012)). It is
surprising, however, to find this compatibility in the simplest possible dynamic
equilibrium context.
It is difficult to derive fully general results for Property III without further
specialization of the productivity process.17 Consider Proposition 3.4.
Proposition 3.4: Consider model (6) specialized as per (11) with a

. Then,

The equity price series and dividend series are mean averting by

Property III;
(ii)

The return on equity is mean reverting by Property III.

Proof: See Donaldson et al. (2015).
The proof of Proposition 3.4 reveals that concavity in production (α < 1)
is also key in generating Property III mean reversion in equity returns. These
results are entirely consistent with those obtained for our earlier analysis of
Properties I and II. Nevertheless, the fact that Property III is not discriminating

16

Indeed, in this simple model both equity prices and dividends are mean averting, yet equity
returns are nevertheless mean reverting.

across AR(1) processes for various ρ tends to disqualify it as a critical mean
reversion characterization.
For the Baseline Model, Property IV is not satisfied; there appears no
single κ for which condition (5) holds. It is strongly mean reverting, however, in

If the notion of mean reversion is intended to capture the property that
above average values of a stochastic process must regularly be followed by below

average values, then all the series considered thus far, p!te , {d!t }, r!te , p!tb , and

{r! }

qualify: each follows a stationary stochastic process that converges to a

unique, irreducible ergodic set. Yet, as Propositions 3.1. – 3.3 make clear,
(i) mean aversion in a time series (by Properties I – III) does not imply nonstationary, and (ii) stationary of a series does not guarantee mean reversion by
any of the Properties I – IV.
Properties I – IV thus appear to represent artificially restrictive
distinctions relative to the basic intuitive sense of a mean reverting series. A
more useful characterization of mean reversion should allow easy comparisons of
the following sort: when is one time series more highly mean-reverting than
another? Intuitively, a more highly mean reverting series should cross its mean
more often; that is, with greater “frequency.”19 Crossing the mean with greater
frequency must in turn imply less persistence as regards the series being
exclusively either in states above or below its mean. In the next section we
develop this concept of persistence and relate it to the various characterizations
of mean reversion presented thus far.

19

A crossing of the mean from above at time t would signify that 𝑥# ≥ 𝑥̅ , yet 𝑥#&' < 𝑥̅ , and
analogously for crossing the mean from below.

15

4. An Alternative Metric
In view of the preceding discussion, we propose “Average Crossing Time”
(ACT) as a simple measure of persistence. Intuitively a larger ACT would
roughly correspond to less frequent crossings of the mean in turn suggesting
weaker mean reversion. We offer the simple ACT measure because not only does
it help to evaluate Properties I – IV, but because it that provides an intuitive
sense of one series being more weakly mean reverting than another.
A discrete-time stochastic process’s average crossing time (ACT) is the
average number of time periods before the process transitions from above its
unconditional mean to below its unconditional mean or vice versa. Subject to
certain modest refinements, the ACT can be computed by dividing the length of
the series by the number of crossings of the mean observed over its duration.
Under this concept, an economic time series is said to be mean reverting if and
only if its ACT is finite. To gain some intuition for the ACT -autocorrelation
relationship, we computed these quantities for the financial time series generated
by the Baseline model. Table 4.1 presents the results.

These ACT computations (averages) include the period of crossing. See footnote (23)
ahead for the justification behind this convention. In all cases, the series length is
100,000.

Two observations stand out. First, the ordering (smallest to largest) of
correlations and ACT s is the same, subject to rounding and numerical
approximations: a more positive autocorrelation is associated with a larger ACT,
16

which implies less frequent “crossings.” Second, the single negatively
autocorrelated series, {𝑟#* }, is the only one for which the ACT is less than two. In
the remainder of this section, we explore the generality of these observations.
First note that the state variables for any DSGE model follow a Markov
process for an appropriately defined state space and thus can be wellapproximated by a Markov chain of sufficiently high dimension. The same is true
for all the endogenous return series arising in equilibrium. Accordingly, we focus
our attention on chain representations. Furthermore, when appropriately
constructed, a specific two state Markov chains turns out to be all that is
necessary for the ACT computation.
To see this, consider an N state irreducible Markov chain {γ!t } with states
indexed by γi , γ j ,i, j :1, 2,...,N , transition probabilities φij ,i = 1, 2,...,N, j = 1, 2,...,N
and ergodic probabilities πi : i = 1, 2,...,N, πi > 0 ∀i.

20

We will subsequently interpret

these quantities as return or price measurements. Let T denote the chain’s transition
probability matrix with entries φij . Without much loss of generality, we may assume
there exists a state jˆ such that
γ jˆ+1 < E(!
γt ) < γ jˆ ,

a restriction that allows the unambiguous definition of the sets γ A and γ B ,
where
γ A = {γ j : γ j > E(!
γt )}, γ B = {γ j : γ j < E(!
γt )} and γ A ∩ γ B = ∅ .21

For any discrete time Markov process {η!t } , we define the average crossing

above its mean, inclusive of the first period it “crosses”; i.e., assumes a value

in Table 4.1: the only negative autocorrelation is corr r!te , r!t+1

ACT = 1.66, suggesting very frequent crossings. Note that the values in Table
4.1 also confirm the observation formalized as Proposition 4.1: although the
statistics computed there are based on the full series “ {γ!t } ” the ACT correlation relationship expressed in Proposition 4.2 for the “{𝛾"#-. }” series is
observed.
As modest as it is, Proposition 4.2 is a result of interest. Essentially it says
that if Properties I or II are to be satisfied, the process in question must have an
ACT of two or less which suggests very frequent crossings relative to the model
time period. If real world data were subject to either Property I or II criteria, it
is almost certain that tests for mean reversion will fail. To put it more starkly,
the ACT of “white noise” is also 2.
Figure 1 jointly illustrates observations C and D for various
magnifications: in particular the range of ACTs associated with any degree of
autocorrelation, and that all ACTs ≤ 2 are identified with negative
autocorrelation.

From the example in part (C) above, it is clear that the statement of our
original motivating assertion is not generally true: a higher ACT value is not
equivalent to higher autocorrelation. Yet, this assertion appears to capture the
relative autocorrelation-ACT pattern observed in Table 4.1, which suggests that
the underlying multi-state probability transition matrices are “approximately”
symmetric, a fact that follows intuitively from the technology shock symmetry.
F. By continuity, assertion (E) can be generalized in the following way.

By (C) it is also true that for set A: (iv) corr (γ!t , γ!t+1 ) ≤ corr (γ̂!t , γ̂!t+1 ) . If
either inequality (i) or (ii) is strict, then (iii) and (iv) are strict.
23

)

That the set A is non-empty follows from E and continuity: there must
exist a region surrounding the 45º line (where φ AA = φ BB ) for which greater
ACTs and greater (more positive) autocorrelations increase hand in hand. The
question remains only “how large” the region is. The answer is: quite large. This
region is portrayed in Figure 2 and was numerically constructed using the
following alternative representation of the set A:.

For γ!AB

} that are far from symmetric (that is, φ

and φBB are very

different; i.e., the non-shaded region of Figure 2), we do not observe ACT and
autocorrelation increasing in tandem as our original intuition suggested. While
B
BB
individually ∂ACT A / ∂φ AA > 0 and ∂ACT / ∂φ > 0 uniformly, it does not
AA
necessarily follow that, e.g., ∂ACT / ∂φ > 0 . To illustrate, compare the ACTs

for φAA,φBB =(.9, .05) and φ AA,φ BB =(.9, .10):
ACT(φAA =.9,φBB =.05) = 9.148
ACT(φAA =.9,φBB =.10) = 9.111
The phenomenon arises because the relative stationary probabilities change as

φBB increases: more probability weight is placed on the lower ACT BB < ACT AA ,
causing the overall ACT to decline. If φAA ≈ φBB , there is little change in the

(

)

corresponding π A, π B when either φAA or φBB is marginally increased, so that
the more intuitive relationship between the ACT and its corresponding
autocorrelation is observed.
Observation C also suggests that to identify mean reversion solely with
either Property I or II is to forgo information. Any value that this particular
measurement assumes is clearly compatible with a wide range of stochastic
structures ( φ AA, φ BB ). It is rather the knowledge of ACT A and ACT B that is
critical to a comprehensive description of a “mean-reverting” process for
investors. If the intuitive notion of “mean reversion” is the sense of “frequent
crossings,” then as regards the ACT measurement, a mean reverting process by
Properties I or II is not far from a sequentially independent one.
The results in Table 4.1 are also in the spirit of Observations E and F.
Recall that the time series on which the values reported in Table 4.1 are
generated arise by approximating the underlying real economy about its steady
state. Given i.i.d. productivity shocks, the economy evolves symmetrically (about
26

its steady state), suggesting that to a first approximation φ AA ≈ φ BB . The lockstep increases in ACT and correlation that are manifest in Table 4.1 follow
naturally from Observation F; equivalently, the series described in Table 4.1 all

(

)

have corresponding φ AA, φ BB ∈ A .
Note also that the statistics computed for Table 4.1 were created from the

{ }

basic underlying {γ!t } processes rather than its “aggregate state” process γ!tAB .
The fact that the relationships of Proposition 4.2, which are based on the

ptb falls short of its mean, and vice versa, leading to identical ACTs for p!tb

{r! } . These relationships do not generally apply to more elaborate versions of

the Baseline formulation ( ρ = 0 is necessary).
Let us in this context reinforce our earlier remarks concerning the
commonplace characterizations of mean reversion. The results of Table 4.1 clearly
suggest that to identify a mean reverting series exclusively with negative
autocorrelation is not fully informative: all the series in Table 4.1 mean revert

{ } is negatively autocorrelated.

(they have finite ACT measurements), yet only r!te

27

Negative autocorrelation means “extremely frequent crossings of the mean” (a
very small ACT value) nothing more and the nature of these crossings can differ
widely (Observation C).
We conclude this section with some summary remarks:
1. Multiple ACTs map into the same autocorrelation measure, so that the latter
is the coarser measure (and, therefore, less informative).
2. ACTA and ACTB provide more information as they directly measure the
inverse of the frequency of transition.
3. Properties I and II, most especially, thus represent very restrictive
characterizations of mean reversion.
The Baseline model falls short, however, of a full-fledged business cycle
model on many dimensions. In particular, none of the aggregate series is
sufficiently persistent vis-à-vis the data. In the next section we remedy this
particular shortcoming and explore the consequences of this and other model
generalizations for “mean reversion.”

28

5. Model Generalizations
In this section we explore how the ACTA, ACTB, ACT and autocorrelation
of security prices and returns are affected by adding a variety of model features
to the Baseline formulation. It is well known that these added features, especially
in combination, allow the Baseline model to approximate fairly well much of the
observed statistical behavior of the U.S. economy’s macro aggregate time series.
In particular, we consider: (1) persistence in the productivity shocks, (2)
incomplete depreciation, (3) greater concavity in the representative agent’s period
utility function, (4) habit formation, (5) the addition of a labor-leisure choice,
and (6) factor share uncertainty. We describe in detail the consequences of (1)
and (2) as these modifications have substantial implications. Because their effects
are largely marginal, we only offer a brief summary of the results arising from (3)
– (6).

5.1 Adding Persistence in the Productivity Shocks
Table 5.1 and Proposition 5.2 illustrate the consequences of introducing
persistence in the productivity shocks into the Baseline Model in a the way
typical of the DSGE literature. We specialize the production technology to be of
α

the form yt = (k!t ) e

λ!t

(

)

where λ!t+1 = ρλt + ε!t+1 ; {ε!t } is i.i.d., ε!t ~ N 0, σε2 , and

ρ > 0 . Even with persistence in the productivity shocks of this type, the decision
rules take the same form as (13) – (14).23

23

The necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal investment function is:

u1 (ct ) = β ∫ u1 (c!t+1 ) αkt+1 e
α−1

λ!t +1

dF (λt+1;λt ) . For the indicated functional forms and decision rules, this

which reduces to 1 = ∫ dF (ε!t+1 ) = 1

29

Furthermore, the addition of persistence also does not alter the expressions
for pte and rte . However, the expressions for ptb and rtb are modified as follows:
ptb = βe

As regards prices and dividends, the results mirror their earlier
counterparts.

{ }

{ } are

series p!te , the dividend series {dt}, and the risk free asset price series p!tb
all mean averting by Property I.

While the results of Table 5.1–Panel A for equity returns mirror the
conclusions of Propositions 3.3 for the ρ = 0 case, they are not robust: sufficient
persistence in the random productivity disturbance yields an equity return series that
is mean averting (by Properties I and II). The other patterns are consistent with the
conclusions of Proposition 4.2, negative autocorrelated series have ACTs < 2, and
Observation F: for all series ACTs and correlations increase and decrease in tandem.
This latter fact follows from the recognition that all the financial series evolve
roughly symmetrically about their unconditional means, with the implication that
their corresponding TAB matrices are close to symmetric.

by Properties I and II is that α + ρ > 1 .
Proof: See the Technical Appendix.
Proposition 5.2 argues that sufficiently persistent productivity disturbances in

{ } mean

conjunction with production function concavity results in Property I r!te

aversion (risk free returns are always so). Therefore, if a model of this sort is to come
close to matching the observed high persistence in output, equity returns will be
mean averting by Property I and thus Property II.24
None of these results is surprising in the least: the process on the disturbance

residual. For calibrations customary to the macro-finance literature (ρ > 0) mean
aversion in equity returns results as well. It is not obvious what model features would
allow high persistence in aggregate series (as the data reveals) to be compatible with
mean reversion in equity returns and the equity premium, at least as characterized by
Properties I and II. Cogley and Nason (1995) emphasize the close relationship of the
properties of the productivity process to the derived properties of DSGE models’ state
variables and thus security prices and returns.

Proposition 5.3: Consider a stochastic process of the form

, a capital stock term k!tα−α

. While the second term is mean averting for all

values of ρ , the third term is Property I mean averting for (1 − α − ρ ) > 0 , and
Property I mean reverting for

(1 − α − ρ) < 0

by Proposition 5.3 with the switch

occurring for ρ slightly greater than .6 (since α = .36 ). Thus for low values of ρ , the
mean aversion across the two terms is reinforcing as ρ increases; for ρ exceeding .64,
the (Property I) mean reversion of the third term works against the (Property I) mean
aversion of the second to bring about the observed effect. We lack an intuitive
explanation.

{ }

The second curious fact is the near independence of the r!t p

series, as

identified by ACT Ar!p = ACT Br!p = 2.02 (since this measurement includes the period of

crossing, the average number of periods strictly above and strictly below the mean are
individually each about one). In fact, this near independence is robust to all the model
modifications considered in this paper.
Turning to Property III, as shock persistence increases ( ρ > 0 ) our earlier
Property III results (Proposition 3.4) are weakened for prices: Table 5.2 summarizes
the results of extensive numerical simulations that compute corr (x!s − x!r , x!u − x!r ) for a
wide class of {r, s, t, u}, where r < s < t < u , and {x!t } is chosen from

accounts for our earlier comment that Property III represents a fundamentally
different measurement from either Property I or II.26
We close Section 5.1 with a summary of what we have learned: First,
persistence in the productivity disturbance generically overturns specific results
relative to the case of independence: equity returns appear necessarily to be Property
I mean reverting only in the presence of low persistence productivity disturbances.
Proposition 5.3 further suggests that this particular phenomenon is likely to be
pervasive across many DSGE formulations, implying that the search for mean
reversion in equity returns and the equity premium, at least as characterized by
Properties I and II, and III, is unlikely to be fruitful – if the present family of models

For this reason it deserves greater recognition and evaluation. The patterns in Table 5.2 are largely
consistent with Proposition 3.4. We thank Natalia Gershun for her many contribution to Table 5.2.

has anything to say about actual economies. To put it differently, we find it
unsurprising from a theoretical perspective, that evidence for mean reversion in
historical equity returns is weak if, indeed, it is based on the economic fundamentals
emphasized in the present, simplified macro-analysis.
5.2 Incomplete Depreciation
In this section we modify the model of Section 5.1 to admit partial
depreciation. As a result, the equation of motion on capital stock becomes:
kt+1 = (1 − Ω)kt + it .
With this change, closed form expressions for the risk-free bond price and its
rate of return are not available. We therefore continue to rely exclusively on
numerical simulation. Table 5.3 summarizes the results.

The message of Panels A and B of Table 5.3 is unambiguous: lower
depreciation rates (smaller Ω ) increase autocorrelations for all price and returns
series except the premium, which is largely unaffected. Compatible results are found
in the ACT measurements. When Ω = .025 all series become positively

{ } when ρ = 0 , in contrast to the conclusions of

autocorrelated, even for r!te

Proposition 3.3 (which applies only to the Ω = 1 case).
Why is this observed? When the depreciation rate declines, then, ceteris
paribus, the period t+1 capital stock becomes more similar to its period t predecessor.
At the same time, investment, which is volatile, shrinks as a proportion of period t+1
capital. The consumption series is similarly affected. As a result, both capital stock
and consumption become more highly autocorrelated as indicated at the bottom of
Panel A. If capital stock becomes more highly autocorrelated so also must be the

5.3 Other Parameter Changes
As mentioned earlier, we also explored the consequences of increasing risk
aversion ( directly or indirectly, via external habit formation), the addition of
endogenous labor/leisure choice etc. These results are summarized below; the
underlying tables and the full explanatory text can be found in the on-line Appendix.
In all cases the conclusions reported are based on the values (entry by entry)
associated with the same parameters ( α, β, ρ, Ω, σt2 ) as employed in Table 5.2.
5.3.1 Greater Risk Aversion27
Entry by entry we see that higher risk aversion, ceteris paribus, increases
autocorrelations and ACTs across all return and price series except for the premium
which is unaffected. Greater representative agent risk aversion translates into the
desire for a smoother intertemporal consumption stream, which leads to higher
consumption autocorrelation. It directly follows that the price of one unit of
consumption next period, the risk-free bond price, and its associated return will
become more highly autocorrelated as well.
On the equity side, in order to promote a smoother consumption path, the
path of the capital stock, {pte } must be made intertemporally more stable – more
positively autocorrelated at the expense of greater investment volatility (to which the
representative agent is indifferent). Accordingly, the equity price and return series
becomes more highly autocorrelated. In summary, within the CRRA class of
preference orderings, greater risk aversion promotes Property I mean aversion for all
financial series; ACT patterns follow in tandem.
It is well known that habit formation causes the agent to behave in a more
risk averse fashion28. Following the conclusions earlier in this section, we find that the

27

Here we expand the basic model to include period preference orderings captured by

u (ct ) = ct1−γ / 1 − γ , for various γ > 1.

39

addition of habit formation increases autocorrelations and ACTs across the board (all
cases of returns and prices except for the premium). The logic behind this effect is
also unchanged from earlier. Higher degrees of risk aversion further compound the
effect.
5.3.2 Adding a Labor/Leisure Choice29
First, if Ω = 1 , then the addition of a labor/leisure choice under either
specification has no impact on the autocorrelations or ACTs for any of the financial
series we study. If Ω < 1 , then the addition of a labor/leisure choice slightly
diminishes the autocorrelations and ACTs for all the series.
In the cases where Ω = 1, the equilibrium level of hours worked, nt is
independent of the shock and capital stock values. The extent of hours represents a
level effect alone, and the ACTs are thus unaffected. In the cases where Ω < 1, the
fact that the ACTs are all somewhat diminished indicates that the addition of a labor
decision variable tends to pull the capital stock and consumption series back towards
their means, relative to an environment in which it is absent. The effect is very
modest, however, and greatest in the Ω = .025 cases where the decline in ACT
28

In the Baseline case, this means modifying the representative agent’s period utility function to be of

the form u (ct − ψct−1 ) = log (ct − ψct−1 ) ; with higher risk aversion, CRRA utilities are modified similarly
29

We do this in two related ways by specifying the representative agent’s period utility function to be

either
(1)

u (ct , 1 − nt ) = logct + A log (1 − nt )

(2)

u (ct , 1 − nt ) = (ctδ (1 − nt ) )

or
1−δ 1−γ

/1− γ

where, nt is the hours of labor supplied in period t. In either case the production function is
generalized to be of the form
f (kt , nt )e t = ktα (nt )

magnitude is about 10%. This is a way of saying that variations in the supply of the
agent’s labor do assist in stabilizing both the economy’s capital stock series (and thus

{ } and {r } ), and its consumption series (and thus reduce the

and rtb ), a fact well known in the business cycle literature. The effect

is small, however, not only because the agent also prefers low variation in leisure,

(1 − n ) , but also for the fact that the capital stock and hours series are themselves
t

very highly positively correlated. The ACTs exceed 2.
We summarize these observations as follows:
1. For the representative agent class of models and the standard mean
reversion characterization, mean aversion, as defined by Properties I and II, in equity
and risk free return is the norm, except in the Baseline case where Ω = 1, and shock
correlation is low.
2. Conditional on the same levels of Ω and ρ, the previous sections
demonstrate that the addition (individually or collectively) of a wide variety of model
features to the Baseline paradigm only serves to increase the Property I--II mean
aversion in most of the time series of interest (the premium is the exception). If the
source of uncertainty is a multiplicative productivity shock, we venture to suggest
that this feature will generally be observed, whatever additional features are imposed.
3. The equity premium remains slightly Property I mean averting for the wide
class of models that we have studied.
In short, Property I or II “mean aversion” appears to rule for all financial time
series within this family of DSGE models. This must be the case if the models are to
have empirical relevance.

41

5.4 Factor Share Uncertainty
The decision to introduce factor share uncertainty arises from the results
reported in Guvenen (2009). He observes a mild negative autocorrelation in the
equity premium at lags of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 years arising in an incomplete markets
model where shareholders trade both equity and debt, but workers trade only debt
securities, a restriction that generates time varying income shares to these two
groups. Following Lansing (2015), we capture variation in factor shares by a reduced
! . In the
form model where uncertainty arises via a stochastic production parameter α
family of complete market models we have been considering, { α t } represents the
share of income to capital30.
For all indicated parameter combinations, both the correlations and the
corresponding ACT’s are, by and large, similar in the two tables except for the mild

{ } as per Guvenen’s (2009) results. In addition, the

negative autocorrelation of r!t p

return on equity is very slightly mean averting for all ρ values unlike in the Baseline
case, and the monotonicity in equity return autocorrelations and ACTs observed in
the Baseline case is lost. Otherwise, if uncertainty in the capital share parameter is

In particular, we explore the extent of mean reversion in the simple complete markets model

identified by the following optimum formulation:

revealed in the Baseline formulation.
We next explore average crossing times for several important US financial time
series.

of U.S. financial return time series. They are: AGG (Barclays Aggregate Bond Fund),
EEM (MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF), SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF), GLD
(SPDR Gold Shares), USO (United States Oil Fund ETF), TIP (Barclays TIPS Bond
Fund ETF), VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market EFT), VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate
EFT) and VIX (CBOE Volatility Index). We provide the data at daily, monthly, and
quarterly frequencies. The quarterly series best corresponds to the implicit time
period in the model economies. Nevertheless, all three frequencies should generate
ACT and autocorrelation relationships generally in accordance with Proposition 4.2
and Observations A. – F.

There are a number of relevant observations. First, note that at quarterly
frequencies (Panel A), the majority (5 out of 9) of return series are Property I mean
averting as was the case for all the models of Section 5, when they were subject to
empirically relevant productivity autocorrelations. Unlike the present models,
empirical bond returns (the AGG series) are mean reverting; this is also true of the
VIX although it has no counterpart in the model-generated return series. In contrast,
all series but one are Property I mean reverting at daily frequency; the sole exception
(the TIPS series) being essentially independently distributed on a set basis through
time (note that φ AA = φ BB ). Nothing here is surprising; it is to be expected that the
underlying processes governing daily returns, whatever they are, will be largely
unrelated to an economy’s aggregate investment and consumption processes.
By Proposition 4.2, if ACT ≤ 2, Property I mean reversion should be observed.
At daily frequencies, this is the case for all series except for TIPs. For monthly and
quarterly series the exceptions are TIPs and GLD (quarterly) and VNG (monthly).
Due to the relative lack of data at quarterly frequencies, it is not entirely surprising
that the greatest number of inconsistencies are found there. At all frequencies the
VIX series strongly endorses the theory.
Note that at daily frequencies all the corresponding T matrices are not far off
independence with the VIX the possible exception. At monthly and quarterly
frequencies, however, this is generally not so, with the VIX return series again being
the most asymmetric in both cases; the VTI is the next most extreme in this regard.
In particular, at quarterly frequencies, the VIX has a .30 probability ( φ AA = .3 ) of
remaining in the above-mean state, while only experiencing a mildly less-than-even
chance of returning to it ( 1 − φ BB = .46 ). At quarterly frequencies the VTI series
remains in the above mean state with probability .61 and returns to it only with
probability .57. As a result, it has a high ACTA. By comparison the ACT for the VIX

is the lowest of all the series for all data frequencies. We leave the rationale for this
pattern to those more familiar with its underlying determination.
Observation E makes clear that there is no necessary positive association
between an increasing ACT and an increasing autocorrelation across the series, and
we do not observe it in the data. With ACTs around 2 (all of our series) the range of
(ACT, correlation) possibilities is large (see Figures 1 and 2). Nevertheless, there is a
weak positive association between a series’ ACT and its autocorrelation, an assertion
captured in Figure 3, where we undertake the following simple cross-sectional
regression:

autocorrelationi = α + β ACT i + ε!i .
We find β > 0 with an R2 of .0656 for monthly series and a T statistic of .65, which
is unfortunately not significant. We suspect this is due to the high dispersion in the
estimates; the results are similar at the other frequencies we consider. The fact that
the R2 is low derives from the observation that many of the series have set transition
matrices that are far from symmetric, as manifest in ∅-- being significantly different
from ∅.. (and, as a result, ACTA and ACTB differing considerably). This being said,
the modest theory presented in Section 4 finds modest empirical support.

7. Conclusion
In this paper, we have argued that the notions of mean reversion and mean
aversion can be synthesized under one metric, the Average Crossing Time (ACT)
with ACTA and ACTB as its underlying constituents. By the ACT measure, the mean
aversion/reversion distinction is entirely artificial, with a mean reverting (stationary)
process being only identified with a finite ACT value. One may think of mean
averting processes as those with larger ACTs but there is nothing in the ACT concept
that specifies a mean reversion/aversion demarcation value. The ACT concept does
provide, however, a simple, intuitive sense of one time series being more strongly

47

mean reverting than another: its ACTA and ACTB are each lower than its comparison
counterparts.
As an identifying measure, the ACT allows us to evaluate other time series
characteristics that have been “traditional identifiers” of “mean reversion.” We
considered four of these, classifying them as Properties I – IV. Properties I and II
were shown to be satisfied in the case of the ACT being less than or equal to two,
which strikes us as an extremely strong criterion for “mean reversion.” Most of the
analysis in the paper concerns these properties, as they are the most widely employed.
A careful analysis of Property III is left to future work, for two reasons. First it does
not discriminate in any way for the canonical “mean reverting” AR(1) process across
autocorrelation parameters. Second, it is not often seen. The same should be said for
Property IV; it is very restrictive, not being satisfied in the traditional stationary
models such as those reviewed in Section 5.
Is there any real mean reversion/aversion distinction regarding stationary time
series? Our analysis suggests the distinction is purely arbitrary.

Technical Appendix

In this appendix we extensively use a special case of the Fortunin, Kasteleyn and
Ginibre (1971) inequality 1 (henceforth FKG) in Harris (1960). This inequality
(adapted to our setting) states that for any probability measure on R, and increasing
functions f(x) and g(x),

∫ f (x)g(x)dµ(x) ≥ ∫ f (x)dµ(x)∫ g(x)dµ(x) .

Proof of Proposition 2.1
a.

Property II ⇒ Property I
var (x!t + x!t+1 ) = var (x!t ) + var (x!t+1 ) + 2cov (x!t , x!t+1 ) < 2 var (x!t ) (by Property II)
⇒ var (x!t+1 ) + 2cov (x!t , x!t+1 )< var (x!t ) .
Since var (x!t+1 ) = var (x!t ) , this implies that cov (x!t , x!t+1 ) < 0 ,
Hence Property I holds.

b.

Property I together with the covariance condition (3) implies Property II.
The proof is by induction.
Let j = 1, var (x!t + x!t+1 ) = var (x!t ) + var (x!t+1 ) + 2cov (x!t , x!t+1 ) < 2 var (x!t )
(this follows by Property I and the fact that var (x!t ) = var (x!t+1 ) )
Let j = 2, var (x!t + x!t+1 + x!t+2 )
2

= ∑ var (x!t+j ) + 2cov (x!t , x!t+1 ) +2cov (x!t , x!t+2 ) + 2cov (x!t+1, x!t+2 )
j =0

1

We thank Awi Federgruen for bringing the FKG inequality to our attention.

53

By Property I, 2cov (x!t , x!t+1 ) < 0
and by condition (3), 2cov (x!t , x!t+1 ) + 2cov (x!t , x!t+2 ) < 0
Again by Property I, 2cov (x!t+1, x!t+2 ) < 0 . Therefore,
2

( )

var (x!t + x!t+1 + x!t+2 ) < ∑ var x!t+j = 3 var (x!t ) .
j =0

Suppose, by Property I and condition (3), var (x!t + x!t+1 +... + x!t+j−1 ) < j var (x!t )
holds. We show by induction that this implies
var (x!t + x!t+1 +...+ x!t+j ) < ( j + 1) var (x!t ) .
var (x!t + x!t+1 + x!t+2 +... + x!t+j )
j−2

= var (x!t + x!t+1 +...+ x!t+j−1 ) + var (x!t+j ) + 2∑ cov (x!t+s , x!t+j ) + 2cov (x!t+j−1,, x!t+j )
s=0

j−2

< ( j ) var (x!t ) + var (x!t+j ) + 2∑ cov (x!t+s , x!t+j ) + 2cov (x!t+j−1,, x!t+j )
s=0

(by induction)
By Property I, cov (x!t+j−1,, x!t+j ) < 0. Thus by condition (3),
j−2

+ 2∑ cov (x!t+s , x!t+j ) + 2cov (x!t+j−1,, x!t+j ) < 0 .
s=0

Therefore, since var (x!t+j ) = var (x!t )
var (x!t + x!t+1 +...+ x!t+j ) < ( j + 1) var (x!t ) .
For I ⇒ II, the persistence of the series must rapidly decline.

Proof of Proposition 4.1

{ }

This follows simply from the construction of the derived process γ!tAB .

{ } assumes a value above its mean, it is assuming

Every period the process γ!t

{ } is in set

a value in set γ A . Furthermore, if the process γ!tAB

γ A , then it is

assuming a value above its mean. Thus the average number of periods the

{ } is above its mean (γ!

process γ!t

t

)

∈ γ A must coincide with the average

number of periods it is in set γ A . Thus ACT{Aγ! } = ACT A!AB . A similar
t
{γt }
identification establishes that ACT{Bγ! } = ACT B!AB .
t
{γt }
Properties of

{γ! }
AB

We first restrict attention to a consideration of arbitrary two state Markov
chains. We adopt the convention that any measurement of the ‘time to
crossing’ includes the crossing period itself.

A. Consider an arbitrary two state Markov chain with states γ1 , γ2 and
transition matrix:
γ1

γ2

1 −ϕ1
γ1 ⎡⎢ ϕ1
⎢
γ2 ⎢ 1 −ϕ2
ϕ2
⎣

⎤
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎦

where 0 ˂ ϕ1 ˂ 1 and 0 ˂ ϕ2 ˂ 1. The associated ergodic probability distribution
( π1, π2 ) satisfies
⎡ ϕ
1
⎡ π , π ⎤ = ⎡ π , π ⎤ ⎢⎢
⎣⎢ 1 2 ⎦⎥ ⎣⎢ 1 2 ⎦⎥ ⎢ 1 −ϕ
2
⎣

1 −ϕ1 ⎤⎥
⎥,
ϕ2 ⎥
⎦

61

with solution π1 =

1 − φ2

2 − (φ1 + φ2 )

and π2 =

1 − φ1

2 − (φ1 + φ2 )

B. Suppose the process is in state γ! = γ1 . The average time to crossing to
state 2, ACT1 , is given by:
∞
⎛ γ! = γ

γ! = γ1, for

Without loss of generality, we assume γ1 = 1 and γ2 = −1 , since the
corr (γ!t , γ!t+1 ) is determined by the structure of the transition matrix and not
the specific values assumed by γ!t .2
2

Consider a stochastic process γ!t ; then for any a > 0 and any b ∈ ! , corr (γ! , γ!

Now, clearly, the first element is positive since it is an exponent. Further, since
⎛1 − ρ 2t ⎞⎟
⎟⎟ > 0 ,
σ 2 ⎜⎜⎜
⎜⎝ 1 − ρ 2 ⎟⎠
we know that the second element is a strictly increasing function of ρ, reaching
a value of zero at ρ = 0. Therefore, for ρ < 0, the expression is negative, while
for

ρ > 0 the expression is positive.
