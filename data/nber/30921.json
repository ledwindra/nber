    "abstract": "\n\nI use nominal and real bond risks as new moments to discipline a New Keynesian asset pricing model, where supply shocks, demand shocks, and monetary policy are the fundamental drivers of inflation. Endogenously time-varying risk premia imply that nominal bond risks\u2014as measured by their stock market beta\u2014are a forward-looking indicator of stagflation risks. Calibrating the model separately for the 1980s and the 2000s, I show that positive nominal bond betas in the 1980s resulted from a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of supply shocks and a reactive monetary policy rule, but not from either supply shocks or monetary policy in isolation.\n\n",
