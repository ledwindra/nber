    "abstract": "\n\nThe dynamic effects of fiscal policies on the real equilibrium have been the subject of a large body of recent research, emphasizing the intertemporal dimensions of tax and spending policies both in closed and open-economy contexts. The analysis in this paper extends the intertemporal analysis which was conducted under full certainty to uncertain environments. Specifically the paper uses a two-country stochastic general- equilibrium model of the world economy to address issues concerning the effects of government tax and spending policies on private sector consumption asset portfolios and stock market valuations. The key result of the paper is that the consequences of expected future policies and the characteristics of their international transmission depend critically on the precise variability of these policies across states of nature. The effects of current policies on consumption savings and stock market prices are shown, however to conform closely to the predictions of the corresponding certainty intertemporal model.\n\n",
