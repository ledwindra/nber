Free for Children? Patient Cost-sharing and Healthcare Utilization

ABSTRACT
This study exploits over 5,000 variations in subsidy generosity across ages and municipalities in
Japan to examine how children respond to healthcare prices. We find that free care significantly
increases outpatient spending, with price elasticities considerably smaller than for adults. Price
responses are substantially larger when small copayments are introduced, indicating more elastic
demand around a zero price. We also find that increased utilization primarily reflects low-value
and costly care: increased outpatient spending neither reduces subsequent hospitalization by
“avoidable” conditions nor improves short- or medium-term health outcomes. By contrast,
inappropriate use of antibiotics and costly after-hours visits increase.

1. Introduction
Understanding how a patient responds to the price of healthcare is key to the optimal design of
health insurance. However, past studies on patient cost-sharing are predominantly concentrated on adults
and especially the elderly, and surprisingly little is known regarding children (see Baicker and Goldman
2011 for a review). In fact, many countries subsidize child healthcare, and patient cost-sharing is often
zero (free care). 1 For example, the federal government in the United States (US) regulates the share of
cost paid by patients in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Similarly, child healthcare is
heavily subsidized in countries with universal health insurance, including Germany, the Netherlands,
Sweden, Taiwan, and Korea. 2 The lower out-of-pocket cost, however, may induce unnecessary
consumption of medical services. In fact, in countries with universal coverage, one of the few demandside approaches on containing rising medical expenditure is to fine-tune the level of patient costsharing. 3
There are several good reasons to believe that evidence from adults and the elderly may not be
simply applicable to children. First, mothers, who may need to take their children to medical providers,
may face a higher opportunity cost than the elderly do. Second, the nature of diseases tends to be more
acute than those for the elderly (e.g., asthma vs. diabetes). At the same time, child healthcare utilization
is often preventive and self-limiting, and hence, is potentially more discretionary (Leibowitz et al.
1987). Finally, mothers may perceive a higher return from child healthcare, as children are expected to
live longer, and hence, mothers may seek healthcare regardless of prices or are at least less willing to
reduce their children’s healthcare than to reduce their own.
Exploiting more than 5,000 changes in subsidy status at the municipality-age-time level in Japan,
this study examines how children respond to the price of healthcare. We observe a large number of price
changes, because municipalities expanded subsidies for child healthcare in different timings and covered
different age groups. To this end, we newly hand-collect data on the drastic expansion of subsidies in
Japan in the last decade. We merge this information with individual-level monthly panel data on itemby-item healthcare utilization. This unique variation in subsidy generosity combined with individual
panel data enables us to estimate a number of behavioral responses to the price of healthcare among
children in a difference-in-difference framework.
1

Childhood health has been shown to influence both short- and long-term socioeconomic outcomes and health (Case et
al. 2005; Currie 2009; Smith 2009), providing the ground for generous subsidies for child healthcare in public health
insurance programs across countries.
2 Children and adolescents are exempt from cost-sharing up to the age of 18 years in Germany and the Netherlands.
Similarly, children below the age of 3 years are exempt from payment of healthcare in Taiwan, and those below 6 years
of age are subsidized in Korea. See Nilsson and Paul (2018) for Sweden.
3 Hossein and Gerard (2013) document that the cost-sharing for outpatient care increased between 2000 and 2010
among the high-income countries of the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, France, and the US.

The unique institutional background in Japan offers a clean setting for identifying patient price
responsiveness, since the roles of insurers and medical providers—which are also major players in the
healthcare market—are relatively limited. First, there is no adverse selection into insurance because of
universal coverage. In addition, there are no restrictions by insurers on patients’ choices of medical
providers and thus, patients have direct access to specialist care without going through a gatekeeper or a
referral system. Meanwhile, medical providers cannot price discriminate against patients, as the
physician and hospital are paid solely based on the same national fee schedule regardless of providers’
and patients’ types. On a related point, our insurance claims data inherently include the actual
transaction price, which allows us to quantify the monetary values of (excess) utilization easily, unlike
the case in the US, which is notorious for having a complex price schedule.
Our study contributes to the literature on demand for healthcare among children in several ways.
First, the extensive variation in subsidy status, which is always tied to the age of children, enables us to
estimate age-specific price elasticity of children aged 7–14 years, even at each age at month level. The
price elasticity at various ages can be informative for policymakers to design a more precise cost-sharing
schedule.
Second, we examine whether children asymmetrically respond to the price of healthcare, since
prices change in opposite directions even at the same age in our setting. On the one hand, such
asymmetry—if it exists—provides a cautionary note for applying the price sensitivity estimated from
just one direction of price change (e.g., price increase) when the policymaker considers implementing a
policy with the opposite direction of price change (e.g., price decrease). On the other hand, if such
asymmetry does not exist, it is useful for welfare analysis, as the standard welfare calculation does not
differentiate the direction of the price changes. Despite the importance of this asymmetric feature, past
studies were unable to test it, as there is usually only a single direction of price change.
Third, we examine the effect of a small copayment on utilization. From the policy perspective, it is
informative to know how a patient responds to the introduction of small fees to free care. This is related
to the “zero-price” effect, according to which people substantially increase demand if the price is zero.
For example, Shampanier et al. (2007) show that reducing price from a small positive price to a zero
price discontinuously boosts the demand for the product in a lab, and Douven et al. (2017) present the
same result for the demand for the health insurance. To our knowledge, all of these studies are based on
experiments, unlike ours that use field data.
Finally, we examine whether the increases in utilization primarily reflect beneficial or low-value
care (Baicker et al. 2015). While this is always a challenging task, we adopt the following two
approaches to answer this question to the extent possible. For “beneficial” care, we examine whether
subsidy-induced outpatient care prevents avoidable inpatient admissions, reduces short-term mortality,
and affects medium-term utilization and health outcomes. For low-value care, we investigate whether
3

subsidy increases costly after-hours visits and inappropriate use of antibiotics. Although child healthcare
is often heavily subsidized, to our knowledge, relatively little is known about whether subsidies lead to
beneficial or low-value care.
The first part of the findings documents the basic behavioral price responses to healthcare among
children. We find that reduced patient cost-sharing significantly increases utilization of outpatient care.
When the municipal subsidy lowers the cost-sharing from a nationally set 30% to 0% (i.e., free care), the
probability of at least one outpatient visit per month increases by 6–8 percentage points (or a 19–25%
increase) from the mean of 32% without the subsidy. Similarly, outpatient spending per month increases
by 22–31% under free care. The overall semi-arc elasticities are relatively constant for both outcomes at
approximately –0.60 throughout ages 7–14 years, which is considerably smaller than the conventional
estimate of –2.11 and –2.26 that Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) calculate from the RAND Health Insurance
Experiment (RAND HIE) for nonelderly (Keeler and Rolph 1988). 4
A “back-of-the-envelope” calculation suggests that if the full subsidy is expanded to all the
municipalities among children aged 7–14 years in Japan, the annual outpatient spending increases by
117 billion JPY (1.17 billion USD). 5 Importantly, this creates a substantial negative fiscal externality to
many stakeholders: while the municipality is responsible for covering only 30% of total cost (i.e., the
amount of the subsidy), the remaining 70% of the subsidy-induced excess spending must be financed by
taxes and premiums.
Interestingly, we find little evidence of asymmetric responses, meaning that children respond to
different directions of price changes in a similar magnitude. This finding implies that policymakers can
reasonably employ existing elasticity estimates, including ours, regardless of the direction of the price
changes that they consider. We also find that around the price of zero, a small copayment invokes much
larger price responses. This result indicates that a small copayment can be an effective tool to reduce
moral hazard associated with free care. This result is consistent with the “zero-price” effect.
The second part of the findings answers whether subsidy-induced outpatient spending largely
reflects the increases in beneficial or low-value care. For “beneficial” care, we find that while subsidies
increase the utilization of outpatient care for the Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSCs)—
diagnoses for which proper and early outpatient treatment should reduce subsequent avoidable
admissions—there is little evidence that such increases in outpatient care translate to a reduction in
hospitalization by these “avoidable” conditions. More generally, we find no evidence of “offset” effects:
substantial increases in outpatient spending do not accompany the reduction in inpatient spending. In

4

While most of the literature uses arc elasticity rather than semi-arc elasticity, the arc elasticity is not well defined
when the starting price is zero, as in our case. Thus, instead, we report the semi-arc elasticity throughout the study.
5 For simplicity, the exchange rate of 100 JPY/USD is used throughout the paper.
4

addition, we find little impact on short-run child mortality; however, this result should be interpreted
with considerable caution owing to the very low mortality rate among children of this age range in
Japan. In addition to the short-run effect, we document that the length of free care during childhood is
neither systematically associated with healthcare utilization nor health status in adolescents, suggesting
that subsidy-induced utilization during childhood does not improve the health of subsidy beneficiaries,
even in the medium term. In summary, we find little evidence of increases in “beneficial” care.
Regarding the evidence of low-value or costly care, we first find that reduced cost-sharing
substantially increases after-hours visits, validating the concern that children (and hence, mothers)
exploit the opportunity of free care by increasing physician visits outside of regular hours. Second, we
document that reduced cost-sharing increases the inappropriate use of antibiotics on diagnoses for which
antibiotics are not recommended. This is potentially problematic, as such inappropriate use of antibiotics
leads to both antibiotic resistance and adverse events (Fleming-Dutra et al. 2016). To our knowledge, no
prior studies have investigated whether financial incentives, such as subsidy for child healthcare,
increase inappropriate use of antibiotics for children. 6
Taken together, as we find little evidence of increases in “beneficial” care and ample evidence of
increases in low-value care, the weight of the evidence supports the notion that generous subsidies for
child healthcare leads to the increases in unnecessary and costly visits, implying that short- or mediumterm benefits of such generous subsidies are at least limited among the children we examine.
This study is most related to RAND HIE, which still serves as a gold standard in price sensitivity
among the nonelderly. 7 Leibowitz et al. (1985) specifically analyze children aged under 13 years and
find that, among others, the use of outpatient services decreases as cost-sharing increases. However, the
small sample size of their study hinders identification of the effect for some types of services (e.g.,
inpatient care). Furthermore, their study is more than 30 years old, and thus, changes in the practice of
medicine (e.g., reliance on managed care and development of new technologies) imply that these results
might not be directly applicable to the situation today, especially for countries other than the US. A few
notable exceptions from the nonexperimental works are recent papers by Han et al. (2016), who examine
the effect of cost-sharing at the age of 3 years in Taiwan, and by Nilsson and Paul (2018), who examine
a similar question for children in a region of Sweden. 8 Our study arguably has broader policy

6

For example, Foxman et al. (1987) examine the impact of patient cost-sharing on inappropriate antibiotic use in
RAND HIE but do not separately examine it for children. See also Currie et al. (2011, 2014), who examine the
relationship between the inappropriate use of antibiotics and supply-side financial incentives in China.
7 For studies on patient cost-sharing for the elderly, see Chandra et al. (2010, 2014) in the US, and Shigeoka (2014) and
Fukushima et al. (2016) in Japan.
8 Han et al. (2016) find that lower copayment in Taiwan increases the utilization of outpatient care, especially lowvalue care at high-cost hospitals, but has little effect on children’s health. Nilsson and Paul (2018) exploit the abolition
of copayment for outpatient care among children aged between 7 and 19 years. They find that children increased the
5

implications than these studies have, because of the richness in both the variety and number of changes
in cost-sharing, wider coverage of age ranges, and comprehensive analysis on healthcare utilization.
Finally, this study is related to the extensive literature on health insurance and child healthcare
utilization, especially studies on Medicaid in the US (e.g., Currie and Gruber 1996; Dafny and Gruber
2005; Finkelstein et al. 2012; Goodman-Bacon 2018). However, these studies examine the effect of
health insurance provision per se (extensive margin) rather than the effect of changes in health insurance
generosity (intensive margin), such as our study and RAND HIE do. This distinction is important,
because the provision of health insurance entails large wealth effects, and thus, these studies capture the
combined effects of price reduction and wealth effects.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the institutional background.
Section 3 describes the data, and Section 4 presents our identification strategy. Section 5 documents the
basic findings on children’s price responsiveness to healthcare, and Section 6 investigates whether the
changes in utilization reflect beneficial or low-value care. Section 7 concludes.

2. Background
2.1. Healthcare system in Japan
Since 1961, Japan has had a universal health insurance system, which is heavily regulated by the
government. All citizens are obliged to enroll either in an employment-based insurance system or a
residential-based insurance system (see, e.g., Ikegami and Campbell 1995; Kondo and Shigeoka 2013).
The unique institutional background in Japan offers several advantages in identifying patient price
responsiveness, since the roles of insurers and medical providers are relatively restricted. First,
enrollment in health insurance is mandatory, and more crucially, enrollees cannot choose insurers. Thus,
we do not face the adverse selection problem, which often introduces complication in other studies. The
enrollees receive identical benefits—regardless of insurance types—which include outpatient services,
inpatient services, dental care, and prescription drugs. Second, patients face no restrictions on choices of
medical providers. For example, patients have direct access to specialist care, including teaching
hospitals, without going through a gatekeeper or a referral system, unlike in the US, where insurance
companies restrict the choices of medical providers through managed care.
Third, patients cannot be price discriminated against by medical providers, since all fees paid to
the providers are based solely on the national fee schedule (i.e., fee-for-service). Consequently, medical
providers receive the same fee for the same service regardless of the insurer. This prevents so-called
“cost shifting” in the US (Cutler 1998), whereby medical providers charge private insurers higher prices
number of doctor visits, and children from low-income families are three times more responsive than more advantaged
peers.

to offset losses from the beneficiaries of government-funded health insurance, such as Medicaid.
Another important implication is that any changes in utilization come from quantities instead of prices,
since by default there is no room for price shopping to search for cheaper providers.
2.2. Patient cost-sharing
Patient cost-sharing—for which the beneficiary is responsible out of pocket—has been set
nationally at 30% except for the following two population segments: young children and the elderly. In
particular, the cost-sharing is set at 20% for children aged below 6 years. The insurer pays the remaining
fraction of expenses until the beneficiary meets the stop-loss, and then the patient pays a 1% coinsurance
above the stop-loss. Unlike a typical health insurance plan in the US, in Japan, there are no deductibles.
In addition, supplementary private health insurance covering out-of-pocket costs virtually does not exist
in Japan, probably because the stop-loss prevents the catastrophic income loss upon illness.
The nonlinearity imposed by the stop-loss is a classic but important challenge in estimating price
elasticities (Keeler et al. 1977; Ellis 1986). The issue is that a forward-looking patient who anticipates
spending beyond the stop-loss may respond to the true “shadow” price rather than the “spot” price (e.g.,
Aron-Dine et al. 2015). However, this is unlikely in this setting for the following two reasons. First, only
0.067% person-months exceed the stop-loss, as hospitalization—which is costly and the main reason for
reaching the stop-loss—is very rare among children of this age group (only 0.28% of person-months). In
this sense, the spot and shadow prices are arguably very similar. Second, the stop-loss is set monthly in
Japan, whereas it is set annually in the RAND HIE and most health insurances in the US. To the extent
that illnesses are unpredictable, this shorter interval may make it more difficult for patients to take
advantage of the stop-loss. Thus, bias stemming from the nonlinearity associated with the stop-loss is
likely to be negligible in our case.
Importantly, many municipalities provide subsidies for child healthcare for those who live in the
municipality regardless of their insurance types. This Medical Subsidy for Children and Infants (MSCI)
has drastically expanded in last decade. Children who are eligible for the subsidy receive an additional
insurance card, which entitle them to discounts at medical institutions. Crucially, our claims data
indicate their municipality of residence; thus, we can identify the level of subsidy (and hence, the level
of cost-sharing) that each child faces.

3. Data
3.1. Explanatory variables
Since each municipality determines whether to provide the subsidy, the level of patient costsharing depends on 1) where the child lives (municipality); 2) when the child visits the medical
7

providers (time); and 3) how old the child is at the time of the visit (age). The variations in these three
dimensions are the sources of our identification strategy.
For each municipality, we collected the following four information items on the subsidy for
outpatient care from April 2005 to March 2015: 1) ages that the subsidy covers; 2) the level of patient
cost-sharing (equivalently, the level of municipal subsidy); 3) whether the subsidy is a refund or in-kind;
and 4) whether there are any household income restrictions for subsidy eligibility. We explain each
component in detail below.
First, the generosity of the subsidy is reflected largely by the maximum age until which the
subsidy is provided. Note that while the eligibility age is often expressed by the school grade (e.g., until
the end of junior high school), we loosely use ages throughout this study for convenience, as the school
grades are almost completely equivalent to age in Japan owing to the strict enforcement of the school
entry rule as well as very rare grade retention and advancement (Shigeoka 2015). Second, the level and
form of subsidy (and thus, cost-sharing) differ by municipality: the majority of municipalities fully
subsidize child healthcare (i.e., the coinsurance rate is reduced from the national level of 30% to 0%).
Some municipalities reduce the coinsurance rate to 10%, 15% or 20%, while other municipalities take a
form of copayment, such as 200, 300, or 500 JPY (2, 3, or 5 USD) per visit.
Third, the subsidy payment to patients can take the forms of either refund or in-kind (i.e., future
vs. immediate reimbursement). While the amount of cost-sharing can be identical in the two cases as
long as the parents submit the required documents for a refund, patients may prefer in-kind payment to
refund because of time cost and/or credit constraint. Finally, some municipalities impose income
restrictions on eligibility for the subsidy. While we cannot identify the ineligible individuals owing to
lack of an income variable in our claims data, the fraction of municipalities with an income restriction is
very small in our data. In the empirical model, we include a dummy for income restriction at
municipality×year-month levels.
One contribution of this study is that we construct a new dataset on detailed subsidy information at
each municipality-age-time level (where both age and time are measured in months). Since information
disaggregated at the monthly level is not formally collected even by either the prefectural or central
government, we hand-collect it through a variety of sources, including the municipality web page, local
newspaper, and municipal ordinances. After collecting the data, we directly contact each municipality
and verify the accuracy of our information. Since such information for this long period (10 years) is not
well kept in records in small municipalities, we limit the data collection to municipalities in the six

8

largest prefectures in Japan, which results in 323 municipalities. 9 According to national statistics, these
six prefectures cover as much as 44.9% of children aged 0–15 years. While our data are not nationally
representative, one benefit of restricting the sample to these large prefectures is that municipalities are
likely more comparable, which is useful for our difference-in-difference identification strategy.
Figure 1 plots the share of municipalities in our insurance claims data by the maximum age for the
subsidy eligibility for outpatient care during April 2005–March 2015 among the 165 municipalities
mainly used in this study, as explained in Subsection 3.3. 10 Note that Figure 1 reflects the compositional
changes of municipalities, as the number of municipalities increases in the later period in our claims
data. Within the municipalities, the subsidy expansion is always monotonic—that is, no single
municipality lowers the maximum age during this period (April 2005–March 2015).
Figure 1 clearly shows that the subsidy expanded rapidly to older ages in the last decade. For
example, none of the municipalities provides the subsidy until the age of 15 years (the end of junior high
school) in April 2005, the beginning of the sample period. However, this number reaches nearly 80%
within 10 years by March 2015, the end of our sample period. The spike in April 2008 is explained by
the fact that the central government expanded the eligibility age for the national-level subsidy (i.e., 20%
coinsurance rate) from 3 to 6 years (the start of primary school). While Figure 1 clearly shows that all
municipalities in our sample already provided the subsidy until the age of 6 years by April 2008, this
national-level subsidy expansion eases the budgetary burden on municipalities, as part of the cost is now
covered by the central government. For this reason, we observe the highest number of municipality-level
subsidy expansions in April 2008 for ages above 6 years (see Appendix Figure A-1 on the precise timing
of all policy changes).
While the main reason for the subsidy provision is to ensure access to essential medical care for
children and lessen financial burden on parents, the exact reasons for such rapid expansion in the last
decade are not fully understood. A few other justifications for the subsidy provision mentioned in the
literature are to attract young couples with children for tax revenues, boost low fertility rates, and
combat recent increases in child poverty (Bessho 2012). We discuss potential endogeneity of subsidy
expansions in Subsection 4.2.

9 This includes municipalities that merged during this sample period. All results throughout the study are essentially the
same if we exclude these municipalities, since they tend to be very small (results are available upon request). There
were a total of 47 prefectures and 1,719 municipalities in Japan as of January 2015.
10 We also collected information on subsidy for inpatient care. However, most municipalities had already covered
inpatient care until the age of 15 years (the end of junior high school), and thus, there is not much variation in eligibility
of subsidy for inpatient care. In fact, when we examine the effect of subsidy for inpatient care on inpatient spending, we
detect no meaningful results (results are available upon request). These results are consistent with RAND HIE, which
finds that children respond only to the price of outpatient care but not inpatient care (Newhouse and the Insurance
Experiment Group 1993). Therefore, we focus on subsidies for outpatient care throughout this study to save space.

9

3.2. Outcome variables
Our outcome data come from the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC), which collects and analyzes
administrative insurance claims data on behalf of insurers of large corporations. Since parents of the
children in the JMDC data work for large firms, our sample does not include children with extremely
low household income, such as those who receive public assistance. Therefore, the liquidity constraint is
unlikely to explain the results described below. As of November 2015, the JMDC claims database
contains more than 3 million enrollees.
JMDC data consist of administrative enrollment data and claims data. For each person, the
enrollment data consist of patient ID, gender, age, and municipality of residence. The age and
municipality of residence in each month are crucial in this study, as the level of cost-sharing is uniquely
determined by the municipality-age-time. The claims data report the monthly spending, including the
months of no utilization. 11 Specifically, the claims data contain the year-month of the visit, and line-byline medical services received, including diagnoses (ICD10), types of services, quantity of each service,
and fees charged for each service based on the national fee schedule. The unit of claims data is monthly
in Japan, as the reimbursement to medical institutions occurs monthly. The enrollment and claims data
are linked by a unique patient ID.
There are a few advantages of this claims data. The biggest advantage is that the data observe both
outpatient (including prescription drug) and inpatient care, and follow the same individual over time.
This allows us to examine, for example, whether childhood subsidy has a beneficial effect over the
medium run when children become adolescents. Furthermore, we can test the possibility of the “offset”
effect—whether beneficial outpatient care prevents avoidable inpatient admissions in the future. By
contrast, the outpatient and inpatient data are often separated in the other settings. For example, hospital
discharge data do not usually include information on office visits and prescription drugs. In addition, the
claims data in Japan include actual transaction prices, since the national fee schedule sets uniform prices
for each procedure, which is applied to all patients. This price information enables us to quantify the
monetary values of (excess) utilization easily.
Our dataset is constructed as follows. We provide the subsidy information we collected to the
JMDC, which merged it with their insurance claims data in-house by municipality and year-month, and
returned it to us with the municipality ID and patient ID de-identified for confidentiality reasons. Thus,
we could not examine the heterogeneity by the characteristics of the municipality (e.g., the average
household income or maternal education), as the municipality ID is scrambled. Another drawback—
albeit usual for insurance claims data—is that the data do not include individual characteristics (except
11

The data do not, however, contain dental claims, and inpatient food and housing costs. The latter is small, since the
length of stay is short, unlike the case of the elderly.
10

gender and age of children), such as maternal education, household income, and family structure (e.g.,
number of children or siblings).
3.3. Sample restriction
Our data cover a period of 10 years between April 2005 and March 2015 (120 months). We focus
on children aged 7–14 years (96 months) since, as shown in Appendix Figure A-2, we do not have many
observations without subsidy below age 7 years and with subsidy above age 15 years. This is because
the majority of municipalities (81.3%) already provided the subsidy until the age of 6 years (start of
primary school) at the beginning of our sample period, and most municipalities do not provide subsidy
beyond age 15 years (end of junior high school) at the end of our sample period. Therefore, we limit our
sample to 6–15 year-olds (one year wider on both sides of the ages of interest) to identify the effect of
patient cost-sharing at ages 7–14 years. 12
Then, we create the two samples (main sample and full sample). We create the main sample by
limiting it to 165 municipalities, which only have either 0% (full subsidy) or 30% (no subsidy) patient
cost-sharing during our sample period, for the following reasons. First, the transitions of “30% to 0%”
and “0% to 30%” in cost-sharing are by far the top two variations, as shown in Table 1, which lists the
top 10 combinations of cost-sharing transitions (see Appendix Table A-1 for the complete list). These
two variations account for 54.2% of all the transitions at the municipality-age-time level (the unit of
variation), and as much as 70.0% at the person-month level (the unit of observation). In fact, even after
imposing such restrictions, we maintain as many as 5,438 changes in subsidy status at the municipalityage-time cell, which is the level of variation for identification in our empirical analysis. 13 Second, these
two price transitions are observed for entire age ranges, which allows us to estimate age-specific price
elasticities across wide age ranges. Third, it is easy to compare the asymmetric price sensitivity to the
opposite directions of price changes, as detailed later.
Appendix Table A-2 shows that the characteristics of children as well as their healthcare
utilization are quite similar between 165 municipalities in the main sample and the remaining
municipalities. This alleviates the concern that municipalities in the main sample are specific, and thus,
that the results are not generalizable. Because the nonlinear price effect (especially how a small
copayment affects demand) is an important empirical and policy question, we later use the full sample
and exploit all price variations to estimate such effects, recognizing the lack of statistical power on some
12

While we control for the subsidy status at ages 6 and 15 years in the regressions, we do not report these estimates to
save space, as they are very noisy.
13 Note that since we only include municipalities that have either a 0% or 30% of coinsurance rate throughout our

3.4. Descriptive statistics
Table 2 provides the summary statistics of selected variables in the main sample at the
municipality, individual, and person-month levels in Panels A, B, and C, respectively. Panel A shows
that each municipality is observed on average 76.6 months, and 68.5% of the municipalities have at least
one subsidy expansion. As discussed in Subsection 4.1, the source of variation for identification does not
come simply from the expansion of the subsidy but also from the expiration of the subsidy at a certain
age. At the individual level (Panel B), we have a total of 63,590 individuals, and each individual is
observed for on average 36.2 months. At least one subsidy change is experienced by 21.8% of
individuals: 16.5% experience at least one subsidy expansion (from 30% to 0%) and 19.3% experience
at least one expiration (from 0% to 30%). Gender is well balanced (48.8% are female).
Finally, Panel C of Table 2 reports some key variables at the unit of our analysis (person-month).
We have a total of 2,303,335 person-months over the sample period of 120 months. Almost all the
subsidy is in-kind (99.9%), and very few municipalities impose income restriction for eligibility criteria
(1.5%). In terms of utilization, 40.7% of children make at least one outpatient visit per month on
average, and spend 6,090 JPY (60.9 USD) per month, including zero-spending, and 14,950 JPY (149.5
USD) conditional on at least one visit. 14 Out-of-pocket payment per visit without subsidy is 2,230 JPY
(22.3 USD), which gauges the magnitude of the financial burden on individuals if the subsidy is not
available. Inpatient admission for this age range is very low (only 0.28%), but inpatient care is much
more costly upon admission (406,520 JPY or 4065.2 USD) than outpatient care is.
The simple plots of raw data already reveal interesting patterns. Panel A of Figure 2 plots the raw
means of outpatient utilization at each age for children who live in municipalities with subsidy (labeled
“subsidized”) and those who live in municipalities without subsidy (labeled “no subsidy”). The graph on
the left for an outpatient dummy shows that the line with subsidy is always higher than the line without
subsidy by 8–11 percentage points at any age range, while both age profiles are declining, since the
average health may improve at older ages. The graph on the right demonstrates a similar pattern for
outpatient spending: the mean outpatient spending is 2–3,000 JPY (20–30 USD) higher with the subsidy
than without the subsidy or 40–60% higher, which is substantial. While this figure does not account for
compositional changes in the sample, the main message from the regression analysis below is similar.
Panel B of Figure 2 plots the age profile of inpatient outcomes, which are aggregated in age in years, as
hospital admission is very rare. In contrast to outpatient outcomes, we observe no clear difference in the

Among the OECD countries, the number of doctor consultations is second highest in Japan (12.8 per year in 2015),
including the elderly, resulting in one visit per month on average (OECD 2015).

Appendix Table A-3 lists the major diagnosis groups in our sample by ICD10. The largest share
comes from diseases of the respiratory system, which account for approximately one-third of all the
diagnoses. We also list the top 10 individual diagnoses at the ICD10 4-digit level. The top ranked
diagnoses (e.g., acute bronchitis and acute upper respiratory infection) tend to be more acute whereas the
elderly tend to have more chronic diseases.

4. Identification Strategy
4.1. Source of variations in patient cost-sharing
Before presenting our estimation equation, it is important to clarify the two sources of variations
used in our identification strategy. Importantly, the subsidy (hence, patient cost-sharing) is uniquely
determined by municipality, age, and time. Put differently, each cohort (defined by birth year-month) in
each municipality experiences its own unique price schedule unless they move across municipalities.
Figure 3 illustrates one example of a patient cost-sharing schedule in a particular municipality. By
drawing the two separate price schedules for two cohorts that are born just 1 month apart, we
demonstrate our source of variations in subsidy status at different ages as well as the concept of
asymmetry in price changes.
Panel A of Figure 3 draws the price schedules for each cohort before subsidy expansion. The solid
line draws the price schedule for a cohort born in July 1998 (“younger” cohort, hereafter), and the dotted
line for a cohort born in June 1998 (“older” cohort, hereafter), born a month before the younger cohort.
Suppose that the municipality provides a full subsidy (i.e., 0% coinsurance rate) until the beginning of
primary school (6 years). Since the school year starts in April in Japan, the younger cohort is 6 years and
9 months old, while the older cohort is 6 years and 10 months old, when both cohorts enter primary
school in April 2005. Above this age, children pay the national level of a 30% coinsurance rate.
Suppose that in October 2007 the municipality expands the subsidy up to the end of junior high
school (age 15). Panel B of Figure 3 draws the price schedules after subsidy expansion. The younger
cohort (solid line) pays the full 30% from the age of 6 years and 9 months to the age of 9 years and 2
months, a month before the subsidy expansion in October 2007. Because of subsidy expansion, the
cohort enjoys free care from the age of 9 years and 3 months until the age of 15 years and 8 months
when the cohort graduates from junior high school in March 2014. Then, once again, the cohort pays the
full 30% after the age of 15 years and 9 months. On the other hand, the price schedule for the older
cohort (dotted line) is shifted by 1 month to the right, as the cohort is 1 month older than the younger
cohort at the entry of primary school, the subsidy expansion, and graduation from junior high school.
This simple illustration holds two important points. First, any cohort aged between 6 and 15 years
13

benefited from the same subsidy expansion. As a result, each cohort uniquely experienced the subsidy
expansion and the expiration at different ages. This enables us to estimate the price elasticity for broad
age ranges (7–14 years), technically, even at the monthly level.
Second, we can investigate asymmetric price responses to the direction of the price changes, as our
variation includes the price changes in both directions even at the same age. Conventional price theory
suggests that the directions do not matter, as the individuals should respond only to the absolute price
differences (Δ=30% for both cases), irrespective of the starting price level (putting aside income effects).
However, evidence from behavioral economics raises the possibility that this might not be the case. On
the one hand, the elasticities can be smaller in a price increase (labeled “worse” or from 0% to 30%)
than in a price decrease (labeled “better” or from 30% to 0%) if the exposure to free care leads to the
habit formation of visiting doctors, and hence, the utilization does not decrease much even after the price
increases. On the other hand, the elasticities can be larger in a price increase (“worse”) than in a price
decrease (“better”) if individuals are sensitive to differences relative to a reference price (“relative
thinking”) in addition to absolute price differences (e.g., Tversky and Kahneman 1981; Azar 2007,
2011; Saini and Thota 2010). If 0% is an individual’s reference price for healthcare, 30% seems very
expensive, as the ratio of any positive price to zero is infinity, whereas if 30% is an individual’s
reference price, 0% does not seem much more inexpensive (of course, zero can be a special price, which
we discuss in Subsection 5.6). 15 Thus, it is ultimately an empirical question.
The research design of past studies (e.g., a randomized control trial in RAND HIE or a regression
discontinuity design) does not allow testing this question, because there is only a single direction of
price change. In our setting, out of 5,438 changes in subsidy status at the municipality-age-time cell, the
directions of price changes are split nearly half: 2,505 changes are the expansion of the subsidy
(“better”) while 2,933 changes are the expiration of the subsidy (“worse”). We exploit this unique price
variation to identify asymmetric price responses.
4.2. Identification strategy
We attempt to identify the effects of subsidy for child healthcare by exploiting the unique variation
in subsidy across municipality, age, and time combined with the longitudinal claims data in a differencein-difference framework. 16 Specifically, our basic estimation equation (ignoring the asymmetric price
15

We consider that our situation is not directly related to “loss aversion” (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), as the starting
price is different for two directions of price changes, while loss aversion refers to the asymmetric responses to gain and
loss from the same starting (reference) price.
16 We abstract from whether this effect stems from the patient-induced demand, that is, children or mothers ask for
more care when the price is low, or physician-induced demand, that is, doctors may provide aggressive treatments
stemming from their economic motives/benevolence. See, for example, Iizuka (2007, 2012) for studies that attempt to
disentangle these two effects.

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the healthcare utilization by a child 𝑖𝑖 whose age is 𝑎𝑎 (measured in months), in time 𝑡𝑡

(year-month), and living in municipality 𝑚𝑚. 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy, which takes the value 1 if the

outpatient care for children is fully subsidized at age 𝑎𝑎. Since children become eligible or ineligible for

the subsidy at the beginning of the specified month, we can assign the subsidy dummies using the age in
months without measurement errors. 𝛿𝛿𝑎𝑎 , 𝜑𝜑𝑚𝑚 , and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 are fixed effects for age, municipality, and time,

respectively. The simple illustration in the previous subsection heightens the importance of controlling
for these fixed effects. In addition, 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 is the individual fixed effect, which captures the unobserved timeinvariant characteristics of patients and addresses the compositional changes of individuals in the

unbalanced panel data. We also control for two time-varying municipality variables, 𝑋𝑋𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 , a dummy that

takes the value of one if the subsidy is in-kind rather than a refund, and equals one if there is income

restriction on subsidy eligibility, while recognizing the lack of power to identify these effects (which,
thus, is not the focus of this study). We estimate this equation using ordinary least squares (OLS).
Standard errors are clustered at the municipality to account for serial correlation in the error terms within
the municipalities. As discussed in Subsection 5.3, the estimates from alternative models, such as the
one-part or two-part generalized linear model (GLM), are almost identical to the OLS estimates. To ease
the computational burden for estimating the bootstrapped standard errors for our elasticity measures, we
report the OLS estimates throughout the paper.
While we can technically estimate 𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎 (age 𝑎𝑎 in months), as shown later, the monthly estimates 𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎

are relatively stable within age in years. Therefore, we instead report 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 (age 𝐴𝐴 in years) to obtain more
statistical power without losing much information:

where 1(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴) is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the person is more than age 𝐴𝐴 but

less than age 𝐴𝐴 + 1 (or equivalently 1(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴) = 1(𝐴𝐴 ≤ 𝑎𝑎 < 𝐴𝐴 + 1)). We construct age in year dummies

in this way so that age corresponds to school grade. For example, ages 6, 12, and 15 years correspond to
the age of entry to primary school, the last year of primary school, and the last year of junior high school

in Japan, respectively. Our coefficients of interest are a series of 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 (A= 7–14), which capture the average
effect of subsidy within the age ranges. Importantly, we still include 𝛿𝛿𝑎𝑎 at the monthly level to account
for any age in month-specific effects (e.g., graduation from primary school).

For our main analysis, we focus on the sample of nonmovers (98.3% of the sample) who stay in the
same municipality. The migration rate in our sample is lower than actual migration, since intra15

municipality migration is not counted, as the subsidy level does not change. Although we have very few
movers in our data (1.7%), we are still concerned that the estimated effects of the subsidy may be biased
if sicker children move to a municipality that offers a generous subsidy. To alleviate this concern, in
Appendix P, we estimate a discrete choice model that examines whether children (and their parents)
migrate to a municipality that provides free care, finding little evidence that supports such a migration
pattern. In addition, we report that including movers in the sample hardly changes the results owing to the
small amount of inter-municipality migration. For nonmovers, since φ𝑚𝑚 and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 are identical, our final
estimation equation is written as 17

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + ∑14
𝐴𝐴=7 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 {𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 1(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴)} + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝛿𝛿𝑎𝑎 + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 –[3]

The identifying assumption in our difference-in-difference strategy is that there are no unobserved
municipality-specific changes that (1) are correlated with changes in subsidy in the municipality and (2)
are correlated with municipality-specific changes in healthcare utilization. With more than 5,000 changes
in subsidy statuses at the municipality-age-time cell, where both age and time are measured in months, it
is difficult to imagine that such omitted variables are likely to influence our estimates. Nonetheless, it is
still possible that the municipality with a different pre-trend in utilization may implement the subsidy
expansion at a different timing, which may bias our estimates. For example, if municipalities in a better
financial situation are more likely to implement the subsidy expansion, while income effects simply
increase utilization, our estimates may be upward biased.
To account for such concern, we adopt three approaches. First, we conduct an event study that
normalizes the data to the timing of the subsidy changes, and examine whether there are any systematic
differences in the pre-trend between the treated and control municipalities before the changes. Second, we
add a municipality-specific time trend and even time-by-municipality fixed effects (where time is
measured in months), to examine the robustness of our baseline estimates. The latter specification is most
stringent, as these fixed effects capture any municipality-specific policy change or event in a particular
month, if any, such as income transfers, other subsidies, or business cycles. Finally, we limit our sample
to individuals who experienced at least one change in subsidy status. By exploiting only the timing of the
changes in subsidy status, we can to some extent mitigate the concern that individuals in the treatment and
control municipalities might be different.

17

For nonmovers, since time = (birth + age), controlling for age and time fixed effects essentially determines the cohort
(i.e., birth year-month), which experiences the same patient cost-sharing schedule.
16

5. Basic results
5.1. Event study
Before presenting the regression results, we provide the graphical evidence on changes in
outpatient outcomes in the form of an event study. Here, we normalize the data around the change in
subsidy status at any age to increase statistical power. Then, we replace the subsidized dummy in the
estimation equation [3] by the interaction of belonging to the treatment group (i.e., experiencing the
change in subsidy status) and a series of dummies for each month, ranging from 12 months prior to the
change in subsidy status to 12 months after the change (T= –12 to +11, where T=0 is the change in
subsidy status). Thus, the estimates are the weighted average of treatment effects across all ages.
Figure 4 presents the results of the event study for an outpatient dummy (Panel A), and outpatient
spending (Panel B), separately for subsidy expansion (“better”) and subsidy expiration (“worse”). The
reference month is 3 months before the change in subsidy status (T= –3). The scales of the y-axis are set
the same within the panels so that two figures for opposite directions of price changes are visually
comparable.
There are a few important points to make about these graphs. First, they do not seem to show any
pre-trend, as the estimates are mostly close to zero before the changes in subsidy status in both panels.
We are reassured, as this result addresses the concern that the municipalities that expand the subsidy
may have a different trend in healthcare utilization than municipalities that do not.
Second, there is substantial anticipatory utilization, as indicated by drops in subsidy expansion
(“better”) and surges in subsidy expiration (“worse”) just before T=0. This pattern reveals that some
children (and hence, mothers) are aware of the price changes and behave strategically by delaying or
rushing visits. On one hand, the existence of anticipatory utilization is rather surprising, as the nature of
diseases for children tends to be acute. 18 On the other hand, the fact that the magnitude is larger for
subsidy expiration than for subsidy expansion indicates that at least a part of these visits is indeed acute,
because one cannot delay treatments too much until the subsidy expands while one can more easily
stockpile before the subsidy expires. 19 These differential responses can be behavioral in that mothers of
children may react more to a price increase than a price decrease owing to utility loss from giving up the
inexpensive service. 20 Importantly, as we include age and time fixed effects (both in months), this
18

In Japan, schools provide annual health checkups for children free of charge and thus, well-care visits are not likely
to explain the anticipatory utilization.
19 In fact, Appendix E shows that while we see anticipatory utilization for all service categories examined (medication,
consultation fees, laboratory tests, and nonsurgical procedures), the magnitude of anticipatory spending seems to be
larger in medication than nonsurgical procedures.
20 Another potential explanation is that people may be more informed of subsidy expiration (“worse”) than subsidy
expansion (“better”). Suppose the free care is expanded from age 6 to 15 years. Then, a 6-year-old child had to be
aware of the end date of the subsidy at the maximum 9 years. On the other hand, while the subsidy expansion should be
17

difference is not driven by a particular age or year-month effect, such as the expiration of subsidy after
graduation from primary school. In any case, since such anticipated effects—which may overstate our
estimates—seem to be concentrated within 2 months from T=0, we exclude these 4 months of the data
throughout the study. For instance, a similar approach is taken by Chandra et al. (2010). In fact, as
shown later, the estimates and hence, elasticities are barely affected after removing more than 2 months
from T=0. 21
Finally, the effect on utilization seems to be permanent rather than transitory, since the level of the
utilization after T=0 does not revert to the level before T=0. This result justifies the use of the
difference-in-difference strategy, as we do not need to rely on observations only around T=0 to estimate
the effect of cost-sharing on utilization.
5.2. Main results
Figure 5 demonstrates the graphical presentation of estimating equation [3], which plots 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 for

each age (A= 7–14 years) in the upper half and the corresponding semi-arc elasticity in the lower half.
Panels A and B present the results of an outpatient dummy and outpatient spending, respectively. Note
that Appendix Figure C-1 plots the monthly estimates (𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎 ) instead of yearly estimates (𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 ). Since

monthly estimates are relatively stable within age in years (and statistically significant at the 1% level
for any age in months), we do not lose much information by reporting 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 .

Panel A of Figure 5 reveals that the estimates (𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 ) on an outpatient dummy are relatively stable

across ages 7–14 years and are statistically significant at the conventional level for any age. With

subsidy, the probability of seeing a doctor at least once a month increases by 6–8 percentage points. This
translates into 19–25% increases from 0.32, the mean without subsidy among ages 7–14 years. 22
The corresponding semi-arc elasticities presented at the bottom half range from –0.52 to –0.63. 23
Here, considerable caution is necessary when comparing the elasticities estimated across countries and
time periods, and as noted by Aron-Dine et al. (2013), the price elasticity might not be simply captured
announced at least a few months (or even longer) in advance, children have arguably less time to know the start date of
the subsidy.
21 When the net change in utilization around the changes in subsidy status is positive, the excess mass of anticipatory
utilization (e.g., delayed treatment) can be potentially viewed as a particular form of moral hazard (Cabral 2017). If so,
the estimates and corresponding elasticities without removing the data may provide the upper bound.
22 To the extent the congestion at medical institutions deters some demand of healthcare in order to avoid the waiting
cost, our estimates can be a lower bound. Unfortunately, we do not have any data on waiting time.
23 While most of the literature uses arc elasticity rather than semi-arc elasticity, the arc elasticities, which are defined by

by a single price, as the price is often nonlinear. Nonetheless, these numbers are considerably smaller
than the range of –2.11 and –2.26 that Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) calculate from the RAND HIE for the
nonelderly and similar to –0.55 at age 7 years and –0.88 at age 20 years by Nilsson and Paul (2018) in
one region of Sweden. 24 See Appendix B for more details on the derivation of these elasticities.
Panel B of Figure 5 plots the estimates of outpatient spending. While outpatient spending is
arguably of greatest interest—as it eventually captures the size of total utilization—the estimates are
slightly less precise than the extensive margin documented above. The estimates decline slightly as one
gets older: with the subsidy, the outpatient spending increases by 1,380 JPY (13.8 USD) per month at
age 7 years, and by 998 JPY (9.98 USD) per month at age 14 years compared to those without the
subsidy. These estimates correspond to 18–31% increases from 4,490 JPY (44.9 USD), which is the
mean value for ages 7–14 years without subsidy. Semi-arc elasticities also decline slightly with age,
decreasing from –0.74 at age 7 years to –0.63 at age 14 years. To save space, all the corresponding
tables of these figures are reported in Appendix Table C-1.
Since the total number of children aged 7–14 years in Japan was approximately 8.8 million in
2015 (Statistics Bureau 2015), a “back-of-the-envelope” calculation suggests that annual outpatient
spending increases by 117 billion JPY (1.17 billion USD) if free care is expanded to all municipalities in
Japan. 25 This creates a substantial negative fiscal externality to many stakeholders: while the
municipality is responsible for covering only 30% of total cost (i.e., the amount of the subsidy), the
remaining 70% of the subsidy-induced excess spending must be financed by taxes and premiums.
5.3. Robustness checks
We subject these results to a series of robustness checks. For brevity, we leave the detailed
descriptions of the exercises to Appendix D. Critically, the results in Figure 5 on the causal effects of
patient cost-sharing are robust across all specifications considered.
First, we address the potential concern that our control group—namely, children in municipalities
without changes in subsidy—exhibits a different time trend to children in municipalities with subsidy
changes. This does not seem to be a serious concern, since the estimates in the event study before T=0
are not significantly different from zero. Nonetheless, we add the time-by-municipality fixed effects
(where time is measured in months) to account for the time-varying municipality characteristics that can
24 For a direct comparison with RAND HIE, the arc elasticities (which are simply 0.15 times the semi-arc elasticities)
range from –0.07 to –0.10. Again, these numbers are considerably smaller than –0.17 to –0.31 from the RAND HIE
(Keeler and Rolph 1988), and similar to Han et al. (2016), which document arc elasticities of –0.12 and –0.08 for
regular and emergency outpatient care among 3-year-old children in Taiwan, respectively. See Appendix Table A-4 for
comparisons with the related literature.
25 We multiply each 𝛽𝛽 by the number of children aged A in 2015 and sum them to calculate monthly spending. Then,

be potentially correlated with both the expansion of the subsidy and utilization. We are reassured that the
estimates are barely changed in Figure D-1. We also limit our sample to only those individuals who
experienced at least one change in subsidy status, and exploit only the timing of the changes. While the
estimates are noisier owing to the smaller sample, the estimates are qualitatively similar. We also
collapse the data at the municipality-age-time cells, which is the level of variation, to partially account
for zero spending, but the estimates are almost identical.
Second, Figure D-2 presents the sensitivity of our estimates to the size of the “donut-hole.” The
estimates and hence, elasticities are barely affected after excluding 2 months from both sides of T=0.
Finally, Figure D-3 presents the estimates from two nonlinear models (one-part and two-part GLM),
which may better account for the highly skewed distribution of outpatient spending with the large mass
at zero (e.g., Mullahy 1998; Blough et al. 1999; Deb and Norton 2018). As shown in the figure, the
estimates from these alternative models are qualitatively very similar to the OLS estimates. Again, for
ease of estimating the bootstrapped standard errors for our elasticity measures, we report the OLS
estimates throughout the paper.
In Appendix E, we report the results on frequency of outpatient visits as outcomes. The semi-arc
elasticities are similar in magnitude to those of outpatient spending. 26 We also examine the intensive
margin of outpatient use, that is, the outpatient spending and frequency of visits conditional on positive
spending. Both spending and frequency of visits increase, suggesting that the increases in outpatient use
are driven by both extensive and intensive margins. 27
In Appendix F, we examine each type of medical service: the medication accounts for more than
half the share of total spending (54.1%), followed by consultation fees (18.4%), laboratory tests
(17.2%), and nonsurgical procedures (5.3%). 28 The consultation fees—which are charged at each visit
and thus, are closely related to the frequency—are least price sensitive. On the other hand, the medical
services related to the treatment intensity, specifically laboratory tests (including imaging) and
nonsurgical procedures, are more price sensitive. This result is consistent with our finding that the
spending conditional on positive spending also increases. Interestingly, the medication is not as price
sensitive as other service categories are.

26

In addition to OLS, we estimate count data models (Poisson and negative binominal models) to account for the
discrete nature of outpatient visits (see e.g., Pohlmeier and Ulrich 1995). Appendix Figure E-2 shows that the estimates
are very similar.
27 Since both outpatient spending and frequency of outpatient visits increase by similar magnitudes, subsidy does not
affect the spending per visit (results are available upon request).
28 Note here that medication includes fees not only for medicine itself but also those related to prescribing and
dispensing medications, including fees at the pharmacy.
20

5.4. Price responsiveness by health status
Here, we examine the heterogeneity by patient health status. 29 One might expect that, as Manning
et al. (1987) conjecture, medical treatments are less discretionary for sicker patients, and thus, sicker
patients may be less price responsive than healthier patients. If true, a generous subsidy or lack of it
would have relatively little effect on sicker patients. If, on the other hand, sicker patients are more price
responsive, lack of subsidy may substantially affect the chance of the sick to receive care.
Our longitudinal data allow us to examine history-dependent demand responses. We determine
each child’s health status by the outpatient spending in the first 6 months, since each child is observed in
the claims data at different times. Then, we divide children into two types (i.e., sicker or healthier) by
the median spending in each cell: (age in years)×(with or without subsidy) at the first 6 months of
observations. 30 Previous studies have used prior spending as an indicator of health status (e.g., Dranove
et al. 2003).
Appendix Figure G-1 shows that healthier children are much more price sensitive than sicker
children are. For an outpatient dummy, while the semi-arc elasticities for the sick range from –0.36 to –
0.50, those for the healthy range from –0.80 to –1.07, which is considerably larger in magnitude than
that for the sick at any age. While it is slightly noisier, the same observation holds for outpatient
spending. These results indicate that it is not sickly children but healthy children who cut back medical
care most in the absence of a generous subsidy. These results imply that subsidy-induced medical
spending for healthier children is more discretionary.
5.5. Asymmetric price responses
In this subsection, we investigate whether children asymmetrically respond to the price of healthcare
by exploiting the unique variation of price changes in opposite directions. To do so, a subsidized dummy
in equation [3] is decomposed into two sets of dummies as

29

A few papers examine the heterogeneity in price responsiveness by the patient health status but the evidence is mixed
(e.g., Manning et al. 1987; Chandra et al. 2014; Fukushima et al. 2016; Brot-Goldberg et al. 2017).
30 Appendix Figure G-2 experiments with different windows (9 and 12 months) to calculate the patient health status and
finds qualitatively similar results across the windows.
31 Currie et al. (2015) employ a similar strategy to examine the asymmetric effects of the opening and closing of toxic
plants on housing values. Note that this way of constructing variables in our data only makes sense when the changes of
the subsidy status within the individual are less than or equal to two. Thus, we remove 921 individuals (1.45%) who
21

Because of the way in which the indicators are defined, 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 tests the effect of the decrease in cost-

sharing on utilization, relative to individuals in other municipalities without the subsidy, after the subsidy
is expanded, relative to the period when the subsidy was not available. 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 can be interpreted in an
opposite manner.

Figure 6 graphically presents estimating equation [4], which plots 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 and 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 for each age

(A=7–14 years) in the upper half and the corresponding semi-point elasticity in the lower half. 32 Here,
we report semi-point elasticity instead of semi-arc elasticity, as we exactly know the starting price as

well as the direction of the price change. Panels A and B report the results of an outpatient dummy and
outpatient spending, respectively.
Two things are noteworthy. First, the estimates take completely opposite signs for opposite
directions of changes in subsidy status, indicating that our estimates are not driven by just one direction
of price change. For both outcomes, the estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level at any age
range. Second, while the semi-point elasticity for an outpatient dummy is slightly larger in magnitude
for subsidy expansion (“better”) than subsidy expiration (“worse”) at some ages, the semi-point
elasticities for outpatient spending are nearly identical for both directions of price changes. 33 Since we
are eventually interested in the overall spending, we conclude that there is little evidence of asymmetric
price responses.
The nonexistence of asymmetry at least in this setting has an important implication, as the price
sensitivity estimated from one direction of price change may be applicable to the opposite direction of
price change. In addition, it is very useful for welfare analysis, as the standard welfare calculation does
not differentiate the direction of price changes. Since we observe little asymmetry in price sensitivity for
our baseline results, we focus on the estimates from equation [3] without asymmetry hereafter.
5.6. Effect of small copayment
To date, we limit the sample to 165 municipalities that only have either 0% or 30% of coinsurance
rates during our sample period, mainly because of statistical power and simplicity of interpretation.
While the majority of price changes are between 0% and 30%, as listed in Table 1, there are also cases
in which children pay a small copayment, such as 200 JPY (or 2 USD) or 500 JPY (or 5 USD) per visit.

experience more than two changes in subsidy status. We confirm that our baseline estimates are essentially unchanged
once we remove these individuals from the sample (results are available upon request).
32 Specifically, the semi-point elasticity for each direction of price changes is defined as: 𝜀𝜀 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 =

This is because, while the numerator in semi point-elasticity is larger for “worse” (𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 ) than “better” (𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 ),
the denominator is also larger for “worse” (𝑄𝑄1𝐴𝐴 ) than “better” (𝑄𝑄0𝐴𝐴 ) for an obvious reason.

This subsection exploits these variations to observe how a small copayment affects demand relative to
free care. Here, we utilize all the observations (full sample) and all the price variations to examine the
effect of a small copayment, while we recognize the lack of statistical power to gain meaningful
estimates for some outcomes.
Specifically, we expand the basic equation [3] to include all types of subsidies:
𝐶𝐶
′
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + ∑𝐶𝐶 ∑14
𝐴𝐴=7 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 {1(𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = 𝐶𝐶) × 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 1(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴)} + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝛿𝛿𝑎𝑎 + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 +

𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 –[5]

where 𝐶𝐶 takes all levels of coinsurances rates (𝐶𝐶=10, 15, 20, 30%) as well as copayments (𝐶𝐶=200, 300,
500 JPY/visit). Note here that we choose free care (𝐶𝐶=0%) as the control group instead of full cost

(𝐶𝐶=30%) to examine the effect of introducing a small copayment to free care. While we exploit all the
price variations in the estimation, we report only the estimates on two small copayments (𝐶𝐶=200 and
500 JPY/visit or 2 or 5 USD), for both of which we have relatively modest sample sizes (the full
estimates are available upon request).
To obtain a better idea about the magnitude of patient cost-sharing for these two small copayments,
we compute the share of out-of-pocket payment for these copayments. Concretely, we divide the out-ofpocket payment (number of visits per month times the copayment) by the total monthly outpatient
spending. The share of out-of-pocket cost for 200 JPY and 500 JPY per visit are 2–3%, and 5–7%,
respectively, which is substantially smaller than that of 30% coinsurance, suggesting that these two
copayments impose much lower cost-sharing.
The upper graph in Figure 7 plots the series of 𝛽𝛽 𝐶𝐶 (age 𝐴𝐴 is suppressed), where the outcome is a

visit dummy, for two levels of copayment (𝛽𝛽 200 and 𝛽𝛽 500 ) together with the full cost (𝛽𝛽 30% ), just as a

reference. Note that the estimates on 30% coinsurance (𝛽𝛽 30% ) merely flip the sign of the main estimates

reported in Figure 5, as the treatment and control groups are just reserved here. Figure 7 shows that even
though the estimates for two levels of copayment are smaller than that of full cost (6–8 percentage
points), both small copayments reduce the probability of an outpatient visit by 2 to 4 percentage points.
We then convert these estimates into semi-arc elasticities, which are the metrics comparable across
different price levels. 34 The bottom half of Figure 7 plots the semi-arc elasticities for three price

common across all the price levels, and 𝑄𝑄 𝐶𝐶 is the average outcome at each price 𝐶𝐶. Similarly, 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶 is the fraction of outof-pocket at each price 𝐶𝐶 (see Online Appendix B for details). Since 𝛽𝛽 𝐶𝐶 is similar across two copayment levels, 𝑄𝑄𝐶𝐶
(which can be expressed by 𝑄𝑄 𝐶𝐶 =𝑄𝑄 0+ 𝛽𝛽 𝐶𝐶 ) is by construction similar to each other, as 𝑄𝑄 0 is common. Thus, the
remaining 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶 is the important determinant of the differences in 𝜀𝜀 𝐶𝐶 between the two copayment levels.

changes. Interestingly, while the elasticities for the two copayment levels are noisy and have wide
confidence intervals, the semi-arc elasticities of the smaller copayment (𝜀𝜀 200 ) are substantially larger

than those of the larger copayment (𝜀𝜀 500 ). This occurs because the changes in price (𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶 ) that drive the

similar magnitude of changes in outcomes is much smaller for 200 JPY (≈ 2–3%) than 500 JPY/visit (≈
5–7%), leading to larger elasticity for the 200 JPY/visit. Furthermore, the semi-arc elasticities for the
larger copayment (𝜀𝜀 500 ) are larger than that of 30% coinsurance (𝜀𝜀 30% ). 35 This result indicates that a
small copayment can be an effective tool to reduce moral hazard associated with free care.

These results are related to two existing strands of literature. First, our results are broadly consistent
with the “zero-price” effect, according to which people might be particularly sensitive to the price of
zero (e.g., Shampanier et al. 2007; Douven et al. 2017). The underlying idea is that people strongly
perceive the benefits associated with free products because of utility loss due to having to give up the
free product (Hossain and Saini 2015). Our results imply that relative to free care, a small positive price
would substantially reduce healthcare utilization. Second, our results echo the recent argument that
representing elasticities by a single number is potentially problematic (Aron-Dine et al. 2013). While the
context is different, past literature provides such evidence by exploiting the variations in a nonlinear
budget set induced by deductible and stop-losses. 36 Exploiting the variations in cost-sharing across
municipalities and ages, we find that depending on the choice of two price points, price elasticities can
be substantially different.
Again, we should view these results with caution, as they are not fully robust to other outcomes. In
fact, Appendix I presents the same estimates from equation [5] when the outcomes are the frequency of
outpatient visits and outpatient spending. While the estimates for the frequency of visits show
qualitatively similar patterns to the visit dummy, the estimates on spending are substantially noisier and
detract from making any conclusive statements. 37 For the analysis in Section 6, we return to the main
sample with either 0% or 30% of coinsurance rates during our sample period.

6. Beneficial or low-value care
The remaining important question is whether the increased outpatient utilization owing to lower
price (moral hazard) reflects beneficial or low-value care. In fact, the recent work by Baicker et al.
35

We are aware that copayment and coinsurance are conceptually different, and thus, direct comparison warrants
considerable caution. From the patient perspective, the marginal out-of-pocket cost is essentially zero after paying the
copayment. On the other hand, the marginal out-of-pocket cost is always at the coinsurance rate, implying that there is
more scope for the patients to demand care and/or suppliers to provide care under copayment than under coinsurance.
36 Examples include Ellis (1986), Dalton (2014), Aron-Dine et al. (2015), Einav et al. (2015), Kowalski (2015), and
Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017).
37 Our results on outpatient spending are not model sensitive. In fact, Appendix Figure I-2 shows that the estimates are
very similar across different models (OLS, one-part GLS, and two-part GLS).
24

(2015) suggest that welfare implications of quantity changes depend on how they occur. This is always a
challenging task, as we recognize that subsidy-induced utilization should include some aspects of both
essential and nonessential care, as documented in RAND HIE (Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment
Group 1993). Thus, in order to answer this question as best as possible, we focus on the relatively
extreme cases of utilization patterns. In particular, we take the following two approaches. First, we
examine whether we can find any evidence of increases in “beneficial” care (Subsection 6.1). Second,
we examine whether we can find any evidence of low-value or costly care (Subsection 6.2). If we find
little evidence of the first, and ample evidence of the second, the weight of evidence would support the
view that a generous subsidy for child healthcare leads to increases in unnecessary and costly visits.
6.1. Evidence of “beneficial” care
We start by investigating whether subsidy-induced care clearly benefits children. For this, we
examine whether increases in outpatient care prevent avoidable inpatient admissions and reduce shortterm mortality. Furthermore, we examine whether childhood subsidy reduces healthcare utilization and
improves health outcomes when children become adolescents.
6.1.1. Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC)
We start by examining whether outpatient care prevents avoidable inpatient admissions. Instead of
looking at broad disease categories or choosing them arbitrarily, a useful set of preventive care is the
utilization for the so-called Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) or “avoidable conditions”—
diagnoses for which timely and effective outpatient care can help to reduce the risks of hospitalization
by preventing the onset of an illness or condition (e.g., asthma). 38
We employ the ACSC list from Gadomski et al. (1998), who specifically focus on children. 39
Appendix Table J-1 provides the lists of the ACSC with corresponding ICD10 codes, and the fraction of
each ACSC in our sample. Column (2) indicates that conditional on visit, as much as 41% of the
outpatient visits belongs to ACSC, which verifies the acute nature of diseases for children. Among the
list of 17 ACSCs, severe ear, nose, and throat (ENT) infections (56.9%) and asthma (31.5%) account for
nearly 90% of total ACSCs.
Figure 8 plots the estimates from equation [3] when the outcome is an outpatient dummy for (i)
any ACSC, (ii) severe ENT infections, and (iii) asthma. 40 Panel A shows that outpatient visits for these
38

Nonetheless, we estimate equation [4] by the broad diagnosis groups as indicated in Appendix Table A-3. We do not
find much heterogeneity except for the “Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes,” which
shows a slightly smaller elasticity, as these conditions may be more urgent and less discretionary (results are available
upon request).
39 For example, Kaestner et al. (2001) and Dafny and Gruber (2005) examine the ACSC for children.
40 Unfortunately, insurance claims data in Japan list all the ICD10 diagnosed in the month instead of diagnosis for each
visit, making it difficult to examine spending and frequency of visits by ICD10.
25

diagnoses increase when subsidized, and all the estimates are statistically significant at the conventional
level. For example, the outpatient visit by any ACSC increases by 2–4 percentage points during the ages
of 7–14 years, where the mean without subsidy is 0.11.
These results at a glance seem consistent with the literature—that people are price sensitive not
only to nonessential or low-value care but also to essential care. For example, RAND HIE documents
that price sensitivity for preventive care is similar to that for acute or chronic care among children
(Leibowitz et al. 1985). However, most past studies could not examine whether such seemingly
beneficial care indeed leads to better health of patients or prevents avoidable hospital admissions. Here,
one big advantage of our insurance claims data is that they include information for both outpatient and
inpatient care from the same individual over time, unlike most existing datasets that capture either
outpatient or inpatient care. Thus, we can directly examine whether such increases in preventive care in
the outpatient setting indeed lead to reduction in hospitalization.
Panel B in Figure 8 plots the estimates from equation [3], where the outcome is an inpatient
dummy while the explanatory variables are subsidy status for outpatient care as before. 41 We do not
observe any declines in the hospitalization associated with any ACSC or other individual ACSCs. Since
hospitalization among children is very infrequent (0.28% of all person-months), the estimates are overall
imprecise. However, at least the point estimates are always positive instead of negative and even
statistically significant at some ages in the case of asthma. Since the benefit of preventive care may
emerge with a lag, we also estimate a variant of equation [3], in which the explanatory variables are
lagged outpatient subsidy dummies in a simple dynamic model. We find little evidence of any lagged
effects (results are available upon request).
6.1.2. Offset effects
More generally, we examine the possibility of the cross-price effect (widely known as the “offset”
effect in health economics)—whether outpatient spending replaces inpatient spending. If patients cut
spending for preventive outpatient care in response to a price increase in outpatient care and,
consequently, need to be hospitalized later, then cost-saving through reduction in outpatient care can be
eventually “offset” by the subsequent increase in costly inpatient admission. However, it is also possible
that if the outpatient visits lead to a referral to a specialist for additional examination and invasive
treatment for a condition that would otherwise have resolved itself in time (self-limiting) or simply
increase the chance of detecting serious health problems, a price increase in outpatient care will decrease
both outpatient and inpatient care use. Note that the analysis on ACSCs in the previous subsection is a
special case of the “offset” effect, which focuses on conditions specific to ACSCs.
41

Whenever we examine the inpatient outcomes, we also control for the subsidy for inpatient care, while adding these
variables does not affect our results, as there is little variation in inpatient subsidy.
26

Whether outpatient care is a substitute for or complement to inpatient care is an important but
unsettled question in health economics. Overall, RAND HIE finds no evidence of “offset” effects
(Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group 1993). Some studies report that outpatient and
inpatient care are complements (e.g., Kaestner and Lo Sasso 2015) while a few studies that document
the evidence of offset effects are concentrated among the elderly (e.g., Chandra et al. 2010, Trivedi et al.
2010). To our knowledge, there is no study that examines the cross-price effects for child healthcare
except for RAND HIE, which lacks statistical power for making decisive conclusions owing to its very
small sample size of children (1,136 children whose families participated in a randomized trial).
To investigate this question, we replace the outcome in equation [3] with an inpatient dummy or
inpatient spending while the explanatory variable is still subsidy for outpatient care. In this way, we can
investigate whether the change in subsidy for outpatient care has any impact on inpatient care. 42
Panel A of Figure 9 plots the estimates on the probability of hospitalization, and Panel B plots the
estimates on inpatient spending. Out of 16 point estimates (8 for each age for each outcome), none of the
estimates except one are statistically significant at the conventional level (see Appendix Table K-1). In
addition, the estimates are mostly positive albeit statistically insignificant, implying that the generous
subsidy for outpatient care does not reduce the utilization of inpatient care and, if anything, increases
hospitalization, despite the large increases in outpatient visits and spending documented so far. These
results echo the findings on ACSC in the previous subsection.
6.1.3. Short-term mortality
Next, we investigate whether subsidy affects the most drastic health outcome: short-term
(cotemporaneous) mortality. We recognize that the mortality rate among this age range in Japan is
extremely low (in fact, there are only 68 deaths or 0.107% of our sample) and hence, we may lack the
statistical power to draw precise inferences. 43 Nonetheless, we still examine mortality for the sake of
completeness, as we believe that it is arguably the most objective health outcome.
In this analysis, instead of simple OLS, we account for the interval-censored nature of the
mortality data in a discrete-time duration model (Jenkins 1995). Specifically, we estimate the following
complementary log-log regression model (which is a discrete analog of the continuous proportional
hazards model) through maximum likelihood:

42

Following Kaestner and Lo Sasso (2015), we also estimate the effect of outpatient spending on inpatient use by
instrumenting outpatient spending by outpatient subsidy. We find that the estimates 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 are always positive, as in Figure
9, but they are not precisely estimated (results are available upon request).
43 The mortality dummy takes one if either 1) enrollment data indicate death as the reason for drop-out from the data, or
2) claims data indicate death as a result of treatment at the medical institutions. We recognize that our data might not
capture all deaths if, for example, children die outside of medical institutions (e.g., home) and the death is not reported
to the insurers, although as many as 83.1% of children aged 5–14 years die in a hospital (Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare 2010).

captures the underlying baseline hazard. We also control for year fixed effects, month fixed effects, and a

female dummy. 44

Appendix Figure L-1 plots the series of 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 when 𝑓𝑓(𝑎𝑎) is log of age in months. While the estimates

are somewhat noisy, none of the estimates at any age is statistically and economically significant. We
also experiment with different functional forms of 𝑓𝑓(𝑎𝑎), including linear in age, and age (in year)

dummies, which capture the underlying baseline hazard more flexibly. Appendix Table L-1 shows that
the estimates are very similar. Thus, at least in the short run, we find little evidence on reduction in child
mortality; however, we need to interpret this finding with considerable caution owing to the very low
child mortality rate.
6.1.4. Medium-term utilization and health outcomes
Finally, we explore the medium-run effects of subsidy on healthcare utilization and health
outcomes. It is possible that a generous subsidy during childhood increases beneficial care and makes
children healthy, which, in turn, may reduce healthcare utilization and improve health outcomes when
they become adolescents.
Here, we exploit the fact that 1) in almost all the municipalities, subsidy expires at the age of 15
years (end of junior high school); 2) by contrast, the duration of subsidy that children receive before the
age of 15 years substantially differs by municipalities. Thus, we can relate the length of the free care
until the age of 15 years with healthcare utilization and health outcomes after the subsidy expiration at
15 years. In this way, we can cleanly identify the medium-run effects of subsidy. This approach is in the
same spirit as the recent studies that relate Medicaid eligibility during childhood to later-life utilization
and health outcomes (e.g., Wherry et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2016). Our study has an advantage in that
we can more accurately measure the length of free care that each individual was exposed to.
As for the outcomes, we examine healthcare utilization in the first year (age 16 years) and the third
year (age 18 years) after the subsidy expiration at the age of 15 years. After 18 years (i.e., graduation
from high school), unfortunately, the substantial fraction of children (28.5% in our sample) is lost in the
sample, because they move away from the municipalities to enter college/university or start working.
We calculate the length of free care until the age of 15 years in the following way. As our data
span precisely 10 school years, we choose the cohorts for which we observe the longest history of

44

We cannot include year-month fixed effects and municipality fixed effects, since there is no death at every yearmonth and in every municipality. As a result, many observations are dropped from the sample if we include them in the
complementary log-log regression.
28

subsidy information (9 years) as well as 1 full year of utilization at the age of either 16 years or 18 years.
This minimizes the measurement errors in the length of free care. Specifically, for the cohorts who were
aged 6 (8) years in April 2005—the start of our sample period—we observe one year of utilization at age
16 (18) years as well as the subsidy information at ages 6–15 (8–17) years. Combining the information
on the maximum age of subsidy eligibility in April 2005, we construct the history of subsidy exposure
from ages 0–15 years for each individual, assuming that there is no inter-municipality migration before
age 6 (8) years. For the samples aged 16 (18) years, we have a total of 3,643 (3,426) individuals. The
average length of free care between the ages of 0–15 years for the sample aged 16 (18) years is 10.91
(8.64) years with SD of 2.09 (2.06). 45 The minimum and maximum are 4 years and the full 15 years,
respectively, for both samples.
With this set-up, Panel A of Figure 10 plots the relationship between the length of free care and
average monthly spending—which is the sum of outpatient and inpatient spending—during 1 year at the
ages of 16 and 18 years. Each dot presents the means of the outcome by each birth year-month
cohort×municipality. The dotted line is the predicted values of weighted least square regressions, where
weight is the number of observations in each dot.
We find little evidence that more years of subsidy exposure during childhood decrease utilization
after subsidy expiration. The slope for the sample aged 16 years is –0.066 (p-value= 0.760), which is far
from statistically significant, and economically very small, indicating that a 1-year increase in subsidy
exposure during childhood decreases the total monthly spending at age 16 years by as small as 66 JPY
(or 0.66USD). 46 We also examine outpatient and inpatient care separately, but the results are
qualitatively very similar (not shown). 47 The slope for the sample aged 18 years is even slightly positive,
0.406 (p-value= 0.341) and again economically small.
One might argue that utilization might not fully capture the health status of children, if for
example, children form a habit of seeing a doctor owing to longer subsidy exposure. To account for this
concern, we next examine the occurrence of serious chronic health problems at the ages of 16 or 18
years. Feudtner et al. (2014) develop pediatric complex chronic conditions (CCCs), which are defined as
“any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death

45

The age 16 (18) sample includes 12 birth-month cohorts born between April 1998 and March 1999 (April 1996 and
March 1997). Among 3,678 (3,463) individuals, we exclude 35 (37) individuals who live in municipalities that provide
subsidy after age 15. The average length of free care is longer for the age 16 sample than the age 18 sample is because
the former is younger and free care has expanded over time, as shown in Figure 1.
46 We formally run the specification where we also include birth year-month fixed effects (12 cohort fixed effects) and
a dummy for female. The results are essentially the same (results are available upon request).
47 We also investigate whether the free care at different ages has differential impacts on later-life utilization.
Specifically, we break the total length of free care by age, but none of the estimates is statistically and economically
significant (results are available upon request).
29

intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to
require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center.” 48
Appendix Table M-1 provides the list of pediatric CCCs and the descriptive statistics; 8.7% of
individuals (N= 7,069) are diagnosed with one of the CCCs in 12 months for those aged either 16 or 18
years.
Panel B of Figure 10 plots the relationship between the length of free care and an outcome that
takes one if any visits/admissions are diagnosed with any CCCs at the ages of 16 or 18 years. Again, we
observe no discernable pattern. The slopes for both samples aged 16 and 18 years are economically very
small (0.0001 and 0.0010) and far from statistically significant (p-value= 0.957 and 0.674).
Our results contrast with the recent studies on Medicaid that find some positive effect of Medicaid
eligibility on long-term health outcomes. 49 However, these studies are likely to find larger impacts, as
the policy change is more drastic: these studies focus on the provision of health insurance (extensive
margin) and the targeted population is more disadvantaged. In our setting, in which universal coverage
guarantees the minimum access to healthcare, the additional subsidy that reduces the coinsurance rate
from 30% to 0% (intensive margin) does not seem to have any short-term and medium-term health
benefits, at least among the health outcomes observed in our data.
6.2. Evidence of low-value or costly care
Then, we next turn to examine whether we can find clear evidence that subsidy induced care
results in low-value or costly care.
6.2.1. After-hours visits
One concern with a generous subsidy is that children (and hence, mothers) exploit the opportunity
by increasing after-hours visits outside of regular hours, because additional fees for after-hours visits are
also subsidized. This may place a substantial burden on the workload of physicians as well as increase
medical spending as the fees for after-hours visits are set higher by a national fee schedule. On the other
hand, if these visits are indeed urgent and not discretionary, the generous subsidy may have little impact
on this type of visit. While this issue has been raised repeatedly in the media, no formal analysis has

48

These measures are widely used and “aimed to identify infants, children, and adolescents diagnosed with complex
chronic conditions, with an emphasis on examining patterns of mortality and of end-of-life healthcare utilization
associated with CCCs” (Feudtner et al. 2014). In fact, these pediatric CCCs are derived using the sample of children 0
to 18 years old.
49 Examples include Medicaid introduction (e.g., Goodman-Bacon 2016; Boudreaux et al. 2016) and Medicaid
expansion (e.g., Currie et al. 2008; Sommers et al. 2012; Brown et al. 2016; Thompson 2017; Miller and Wherry
2018; Wherry et al. 2018).

been undertaken. 50
We divide the visits into three categories: 1) regular-hour visits, 2) after-hours visits, and 3)
midnight/holiday visits. Under the national fee schedule, additional fees for after-hours visits and
midnight/holiday visits are charged on top of the consultation fees for regular-hour visits, and thus, from
the billing information, we know the timing of the outpatient visit within a day. 51 Appendix Table N-1
provides the list of billing codes for these after-hours visits and midnight/holiday visits and
corresponding additional fees. As a benchmark, fees for regular-hour visits during the sample period are
approximately 2,800 and 700 JPY (28 and 7 USD) for the first visit and revisits, respectively. The
additional fees charged for after-hours visits—which are typically 850 and 650 JPY (8.5 and 6.5 USD)
for the first visit and revisits, respectively—are relatively high, making these visits costly. Moreover, the
additional fees for midnight/holiday visits are set even higher than those of after-hours visits.
Figure 11 plots the estimates (𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 ) for regular-hour visits (for references), after-hours visits, and

midnight/holiday visits. Since the consultation fees are charged by each time of visit, the frequency of
visits is the natural candidate of outcome. Since the majority of the visits are regular-hour visits (89.1%
of total visits), Panel A shows a similar pattern to our baseline estimates reported in Figure 5, and the
semi-arc elasticities are stable at approximately –0.6 throughout the age ranges.
Interestingly, Panel B of Figure 11 shows that costly after-hours visits—which account for 8.4% of
total visits—also increase owing to subsidy. The estimates are slightly increasing in age and statistically
significant at least above the age of 9 years. These results validate the concern that a generous subsidy
increases the burden on the workload of physicians by inducing children to make after-hours visits. The
semi-arc elasticities are also increasing in age, ranging from as low as –0.51 at the age of 7 years to –
1.23 at the age of 14 years.
Importantly, the semi-arc elasticities for after-hours visits are much larger in magnitude than those
of regular-hour visits at older ages. This indicates that at least at older ages, after-hours visits seem to be
more discretionary and less urgent than regular-hour visits, casting some doubt on the provision of a
generous subsidy for old children. By contrast, we observe no increases in midnight/holiday visits
(which account for only 2.5% of total visits) in Panel C. The semi-arc elasticities are not statistically
distinguishable from zero while they are not precisely estimated. These results suggest that the
midnight/holiday visits are indeed very serious cases, and thus, children and mothers are less price
elastic for these unavoidable visits, which seems plausible. Appendix Figure N-1 reports the estimates
50

Municipalities have indeed been concerned that subsidies for child healthcare may unnecessarily increase after-hours
visits. See, for example, an article from the leading newspaper in Japan (Nikkei 2017).
51 For example, suppose the regular hours of a clinic are registered from 9 am to 5 pm. As the midnight visits are
normally defined by visits between 10 pm and 6 am, the visits outside of regular hours but not during midnight are
considered to be the after-hours visits. Holiday visits are visits on the holiday.
31

on outpatient spending (instead of frequency of visits) with similar results. 52
In summary, the subsidy for child healthcare seems to increase not only regular-hour visits but also
costly after-hours visits, which may increase both the cost and workload of physicians. 53 From a policy
standpoint, a municipal government subsidy partially undoes the effort of the national government to
discourage costly after-hours visits for nonserious reasons by setting higher fees for these visits.
However, we find no evidence that the subsidy increases midnight/holiday visits when the healthcare
resources (e.g., physicians and nurses) are most scarce.
6.2.2. Inappropriate use of antibiotics
Another concern with generous subsidy for children is that it may increase the inappropriate use of
medications. Since more than half of outpatient spending consists of medication and related expenses
(54.1%), this is a valid concern worth investigating. In particular, the biggest worry is the use of
antibiotics for diagnoses that are not recommended, because such inappropriate use leads to both
antibiotic resistance and adverse events. For example, antibiotic-resistant infections annually affect at
least 2 million people, and 23,000 people die as a direct result of these infections in the US (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention 2013). The Japanese government has only recently started addressing
misuse of antibiotics by issuing a prescription guideline in 2017.
We follow Fleming-Dutra et al. (2016) to create the list of diagnoses for which antibiotics are not
recommended. See Appendix O for details. Appendix Table O-1 presents the list with the corresponding
ICD10 as well as summary statistics of antibiotic usage. For example, antibiotic use for children with
bronchitis and asthma is considered inappropriate. Even without subsidy, roughly 20% of children
diagnosed with any of these diseases are prescribed antibiotics (Column 5), pointing out the potential
misuse of antibiotics for children in Japan. Similarly, the average antibiotics spending conditional on
being diagnosed for any of them is 240 JPY (Column 6), and the frequency of antibiotic prescriptions is
0.94 per person-month (Column 7) without subsidy. Both numbers are far from zero.
It could be problematic if the subsidy were to increase the number of children in these diagnoses
who were prescribed antibiotics. To investigate this possibility, we estimate equation [3] in which the
outcome is the interaction of being diagnosed with any of these diseases and total spending on
antibiotics in Panel A of Figure 12, and frequency of antibiotic prescriptions in Panel B. Panel A shows
that the subsidy increases spending on antibiotics by 9 to 20 JPY, which is 17–38% from the mean.

52

Note that the spending here includes only consultation fees and does not include any fees related to treatments during
the visits.
53 It is possible that the additional cost of after-hours visits may be partially offset by the opportunity cost of working
mothers who may need to leave work to take children to outpatient care during regular hours. Ultimately, the
availability of free after-hours visits may affect the labor supply of parents. Unfortunately, since our claims data do not
include any parental information, we cannot investigate such possibilities.
32

Similarly, the frequency of antibiotic prescriptions increases by 0.039 to 0.070 (20–36% from the mean)
in Panel B. Thus, our results suggest that a generous subsidy increases the inappropriate use of
antibiotics, potentially leading to more antibiotic-resistant infections and adverse effects.

7. Conclusions
Understanding the price responsiveness to healthcare is a central question in health economics and
the fundamental issue for the optimal design of health insurance. However, past studies on price elasticity
are predominantly concentrated on adults and the elderly, and surprisingly little is known about children.
In this study, we examine the effect of patient cost-sharing on healthcare utilization among children by
exploiting more than 5,000 regional and over-time variations on subsidy availability.
We find that the reduction in cost-sharing from 30% (national level) to 0% (free) increases outpatient
spending by 22–31% with the semi-arc elasticities at approximately –0.6 throughout ages 7–14 years.
While considerable caution is needed when comparing the elasticities estimated across countries or time
periods, the elasticities for children estimated in this study are considerably smaller than those of RAND
HIE for nonelderly in the US, and Shigeoka (2014) and Fukushima et al. (2016) for the elderly in Japan.
We also document other behavioral price responses. We find little evidence of asymmetric responses to
the price changes of the opposite directions. Furthermore, we find substantially large price responses of
introducing a small copayment to free care (“zero-price” effects).
We further examine the utilization patterns from various dimensions to understand whether
changes in utilization largely reflect beneficial or low-value care. We show that the increases in
outpatient visits do not translate to clear benefits in the form of reduction in hospitalization by
“avoidable” conditions or improvement in short-run and medium-run health outcomes. We also
document that the subsidy has some negative effects by increasing the inappropriate use of antibiotics
and costly after-hours visits.
Taken individually, each piece of empirical evidence might not be sufficient to establish the
existence of wasteful utilization. However, taken together, the weight of the evidence supports the
notion that the drastic expansion of a child healthcare subsidy may lead to increases of low-value and
costly outpatient visits. Importantly, our results contrast with studies on Medicaid in the US, which
document a positive effect of Medicaid eligibility on both short- and long-term utilization and health
outcomes. In our setting, in which universal coverage guarantees minimum access to healthcare, the
additional generous subsidy does not seem to have any meaningful positive impacts, and policy makers
should be cautious about implementing such a policy.
This study is subject to a few limitations. The biggest limitation is that we cannot investigate longterm health outcomes except for short-term mortality and medium-term utilization. Since health is stock,
33

better access to preventive care during childhood may translate into an improvement in long-run health
beyond the ages of our sample, which could justify the generous subsidy for child healthcare. Another
important limitation is that our insurance claims data do not include basic parental characteristics, such
as income and education. This may be especially important in the case of young children, as their
decision making is heavily influenced by mothers. To the best of our knowledge, such monthly data with
age, municipality of residence, healthcare utilization, and household characteristics, do not exist in
Japan—mainly because of the lack of an individual identifier in Japan, such as a social security number
in the US—which leaves an avenue for future research.

Notes: The data is unbalanced monthly panel where the unit of observation is municipality. There are total of 165
municipalities which are mainly used in this study (the main sample). Note that this figure reflects the compositional
changes of municipalities, as the number of municipalities increases in the later period in our claims data. Importantly,
within the municipalities, the subsidy expansion is always monotonic—that is, no single municipality lowers the
maximum age during this period (April 2005–March 2015). The spike in April 2008 is explained by the fact that the
central government expanded the eligibility age for the national-level subsidy (i.e., 20% coinsurance rate) from age 3 to
6 (until the beginning of primary school). While Figure 1 clearly shows that all municipalities in our sample already
provided the subsidy until the age of 6 years by April 2008, this national-level subsidy expansion eases the budgetary
burden on municipalities, as part of the cost is now covered by the central government. For this reason, we observe the
highest number of municipality-level subsidy expansions in April 2008 for ages above 6 years (see Appendix Figure A-1
on the precise timing of all policy changes).

Notes: The main sample is used. See the main text for the sample construction. Panel A plots the monthly mean of outpatient
outcomes, and Panel B plots the yearly mean of inpatient outcomes as inpatient admission is a rare event. An outpatient dummy takes
one if there is at least one outpatient visit per month, and an inpatient dummy takes one if there is at least one hospitalization per
month (×1000). Outpatient spending is the monthly spending on outpatient care and inpatient spending is monthly spending on
inpatient care, both of which are measured in 1000 JPY (approximately 10 USD). The dotted lines are age profiles of utilization
without subsidy (30% coinsurance rate, labeled “no subsidy”), and the solid lines are age profiles of utilization with subsidy (0%
coinsurance rate, labeled “subsidized”).

Notes: Panel A draws the price schedules for each cohort before subsidy expansion. The solid line draws the price schedule for a
cohort born in July 1998 (“younger” cohort, hereafter), and the dotted line for a cohort born in June 1998 (“older” cohort, hereafter),
born a month before the younger cohort. Suppose that the municipality provides a full subsidy (i.e., 0% coinsurance rate) until the
beginning of primary school (6 years). Since the school year starts in April in Japan, the younger cohort is 6 years and 9 months old,
while the older cohort is 6 years and 10 months old, when both cohorts enter primary school in April 2005. Above this age, children
pay the national level of a 30% coinsurance rate. Suppose that in October 2007 the municipality expands the subsidy up to the end of
junior high school (age 15). Panel B draws the price schedules after subsidy expansion. The younger cohort (solid line) pays the full
30% from the age of 6 years and 9 months to the age of 9 years and 2 months, a month before the subsidy expansion in October 2007.
Because of subsidy expansion, the cohort enjoys free care from the age of 9 years and 3 months until the age of 15 years and 8 months
when the cohort graduates from junior high school in March 2014. Then, once again, the cohort pays the full 30% after the age of 15
years and 9 months. On the other hand, the price schedule for the older cohort (dotted line) is shifted by 1 month to the right, as the
cohort is 1 month older than the younger cohort at the entry of primary school, the subsidy expansion, and graduation from junior high
school.

Notes: The main sample is used. An outpatient dummy takes one if there is at least one outpatient visit per month, and outpatient
spending is the monthly spending on outpatient care measured in 1000 JPY (approximately 10 USD). “Better” indicates the subsidy
expansion which lowers the price of healthcare from 30% to 0%, and “worse” indicates subsidy expiration that raises the price from
0% to 30%. The solid lines plot the estimates from a variant of estimation equation [3] where the subsidized dummy is replaced by the
interaction of belonging to the treatment group (i.e., experiencing the change in subsidy status) and a series of dummies for each
month, ranging from 12 months prior to the change in subsidy status to 12 months after the change (T= –12 to +11, where T=0 is the
change in subsidy status). The dotted lines are the 95th confidence intervals where standard errors clustered at municipality level are
used to construct them. The reference month is 3 months before the change (T= –3). The scales of y-axis are set the same within the
panels so that two figures for opposite directions of price changes are visually comparable.

Length of free care (yrs)

Notes: For the samples aged 16 (18) years, we have a total of 3,643 (3,426) individuals. See the main text for the sample construction.
The x-axis is the length of free care (in years) between ages 0–15. The average length of free care between the ages of 0–15 years for
the sample aged 16 (18) years is 10.91 (8.64) years with SD of 2.09 (2.06). The minimum and maximum are 4 years and the full 15
years, respectively, for both samples. The y-axis in Panel A is average monthly spending measured in 1000 JPY (approximately 10
USD), which is the sum of outpatient and inpatient spending. The y-axis in Panel B is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if
any visits/admissions at the ages of 16 and 18 years are diagnosed with any pediatric complex chronic conditions (CCCs). See Online
Appendix M for the list of CCCs. For consistency with the analysis so far, when we examine the utilization during age 16 years, we
exclude two months of the utilization right after the subsidy expiration at age 15 years to account for the intertemporal substitution.
Thus, we observe 10 months of utilization (including these 2 months does not change the results). The dotted line is the predicted
values of weighted least square regressions where weight is the number of observations in each dot. For Panel A, the slope for the
samples aged 16 (18) years are –0.066 (0.406) with p-values of 0.760 (0.341), both of which are far from statistically significant and
economically small. Similarly, for Panel B, the slopes for both samples aged 16 and 18 are economically very small (0.0001 and
0.0010) and far from statistically significant (p-value= 0.957 and 0.674).

Notes: The main sample is used. The frequency of outpatient visits is the number of outpatient visits per month. See Online Appendix M which provides the list of
billing codes for after-hours and midnight/holiday visits and corresponding fees that are additionally charged on top of fees for regular-hour visits. The upper half plots
𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 for each age (A=7–14) from estimating equation [3], and the bottom half plots the corresponding semi-arc elasticity (See Online Appendix B for details). The dotted
lines are the 95th confidence intervals. The standard errors clustered at municipality level are used for estimates, and the bootstrapped standard errors clustered at
municipality with 200 repetitions are used for the semi-arc elasticity. The corresponding table is found in Online Appendix Table N-2.

of diagnoses for which antibiotics are not recommended. The estimates 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 for each age (A=7–14) from estimating equation [3] are
plotted. The dotted lines are the 95th confidence intervals derived from standard errors clustered at municipality level. The
observations within 2 months from the price changes are excluded from the sample to account for anticipatory utilization. The
