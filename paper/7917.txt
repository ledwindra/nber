I. Introduction
The double dividend hypothesis suggests that a tax on pollution can both improve
the environment and reduce distortions in the tax system. In an important article,
Bovenberg and de Mooij (1994) reframed the hypothesis as a question of whether the
optimal tax on pollution in a second best world is higher or lower than the social marginal
damages of pollution. In that paper, they "demonstrate that, in the presence of
preexisting distorting taxes, the optimal pollution tax typically lies below the Pigovian
tax, which fully internalizes the marginal social damage from pollution" (p. 1085).
I argue in this note that the focus on tax rates is misguided. 1 A more important
issue is the relation between the level of tax distortions in the economy and the amount of
environmental quality. Moreover, knowing that the optimal pollution tax falls below
social marginal damages does not imply that environmental quality falls in the presence
of preexisting tax distortions. In effect, we should distinguish between "price" questions
and "quantity" questions. The price question refers to tax rates while the quantity
question refers to the amount of environmental quality. Framed this way, this note
evokes Atkinson and Stern (1974) and their analysis of public good provision in a second
best world. Atkinson and Stern first showed how the Samuelson Condition for pure
public goods is affected by the presence of distortionary taxes (a "price" question). They
then showed how the optimal provision of the pure public good is affected by distorting
taxes (a "quantity" question). A key message in their paper is that answering the question
of how the Samuelson Condition changes tells us nothing about the optimal provision of

The emphasis on tax rates can also be found in a number of papers that followed Bovenberg and de
Mooij, including Fullerton (1997), Schob (1997), and Jaeger (1999).

the public good. This note gives a similar message in the environmental policy arena
(hence the sub-title of the note which plays off the title of Atkinson and Stern's paper).
Specifically, I show that the optimal environmental tax component of a
commodity tax on a polluting good falls short of social marginal damages and that this
environmental tax component falls as revenue needs (and hence tax distortions) rise. The
fact that the environmental tax falls might lead one to believe that environmental quality
would also fall as revenue needs rise. (One might also draw this conclusion from
Bovenberg and de Mooij when they note that "high costs of public funds crowd out not
only ordinary public consumption, but also the collective good of the environment" (p.
1088).) Instead, I show that the response of environmental quality to an increase in the
revenue requirement depends on two effects: (1) a substitution effect, as consumers
substitute from clean to dirty goods as the environmental tax component falls, and (2) an
output effect, as consumers substitute from purchased commodities to leisure (here
assumed to be a clean good). For all reasonable parameter values, I find that the output
effect dominates the substitution effect so that an increase in required revenues improves
the environment while simultaneously reducing the optimal Pigouvian tax increment.
II. The Model and Optimal Tax Rates
In this section, I first present the model and then solve for optimal tax rates on the
clean and dirty good taking into account the environmental externality. I also solve for
the optimal amount of environmental quality. In the next section, I carry out comparative
statics on these optimum prices and quantities to examine how increases in required
government revenue affect both the optimal Pigouvian tax increment as well as the
optimal amount of environmental quality.

2

Following Bovenberg and de Mooij, I employ a linear production technology in
which labor (L) is used to produce a clean good (C), a dirty good (D), and government
services (G). Government services can be either clean or dirty, and I assume that the
fraction of these services that contribute to pollution is constant and equal to γ. The
economy has N identical individuals and labor productivity equals h. Since each good is
produced using one unit of labor, the technology is
(1)

NhL = NC + ND + G.

Utility is a function of the two goods and government services as well as leisure (V) and
environmental quality (E):
(2)

U = u(C, D, V; G, E)

where environmental quality is a function of the aggregate production of the dirty good
and the government good: E = e(ND+γG), with e' <0. Individuals maximize utility
subject to a time constraint (V+L=1) and a budget constraint:
(3)

hL = (1+tC)C + (1+tD)D

where tC is a tax on C and tD, a tax on D. The social marginal damage of pollution in
dollar terms (τ) is the marginal damage divided by the private marginal utility of income
(λ):
(4)

τ= −

∂U
e' N / λ .
∂E

As in Fullerton (1997), I first solve for optimal tax rates conditional on some level
of required government services (G). To do this, first consider a small increase in tD
combined with a revenue- neutral reduction in t C. I totally differentiate the utility
function, plug in the first order conditions from the household's utility maximization
problem and the resource constraint (dL = dC + dD), and obtain a measure of the welfare
3

gain from increasing tD while the tax rate on C is reduced to keep total tax revenues
constant:
dU/λ = tCdC + (tD - τ)dD

(5)

Setting the left hand side of equation (5) equal to zero to solve for the optimal tax rate on
D relative to that on C, I get2
 dC  *
*
tD = τ + −
t C
 dD 

(6)

Perturbing the tax rates will generate changes in all the variables in a general equilibrium.
Thus, I need a complete model in order to determine the changes in C and D to obtain a
closed form solution for the relation between t*C and t*D in equation (6).
First consider the consumer response to a change in price. Following the
approach taken by the previous authors, I assume a subutility function for C and D that is
homothetic and weakly separable from leisure. Let this function be Q(C,D). With this
assumption, I can characterize the preference for C and D in terms of the elasticity of
substitution in consumption (σ):

Ĉ − D̂ = σ( t̂ D − t̂ C )

(7)

dC 
where hats indicate proportional changes  Ĉ =
 and in the case of the tax variables,
C 

t̂ =

. In other words, t̂ is the change in tax as a percentage of the consumer price.
1+ t

The consumer price for C (pC) equals 1+tC, so t̂ C = p̂ C (similarly for pD). Labor earns a
fixed gross wage of h and a real wage of w=h/pQ, where pQ is a price index on the

2

This is equation (9) in Fullerton (1997).

consumption bundle Q(C,D).

Labor supply is related to the real wage by the

uncompensated labor supply elasticity (ε):

L̂ = εŵ .

(8)

The percentage change in the real wage depends on the change in tax rates:
(9)

ŵ = −φt̂ C − (1 − φ ) t̂ D

where φ is the share of consumer spending on the clean good.
Next, I turn to the government's budget constraint. Fixed government spending
(G) is financed by taxes on the N identical households in the economy:
(10)

tCC + tDD = G/N

Differentiating (10) and keeping the level of G fixed, I obtain
(11)

φ( t̂ C + θ CĈ) + (1 − φ)( t̂ D + θ DD̂) = 0,

where θ is the tax expressed as a fraction of the consumer price (e.g. θ C = tC /(1+t C)). The
final equation follows from differentiating the overall resource constraint (1) and defining
production shares π C = C/hL and π D = D/hL:
(12)

L̂ = π C Ĉ + π D D̂ .

Equations (7) - (9), (11), and (12) are five equations from which I can solve for

Ĉ, D̂, L̂, ŵ, and t̂ C as functions of t̂ D .
Some straightforward algebra leads to the general equilibrium response of C and
D to a change in the tax on the dirty good:
(13)

σ (1 − εt D )( p C C + p D D)
dC  D 
Cˆ =

Dˆ =

tˆD

p C C (1 − εt C ) + D( pC (1 − εt D ) + σ ( t D − t C ))
5

Substituting (13) and (14) into (6) yields a simple expression for the relationship between
the optimal tax rates on C and D:3
t *D = t *C + (1 − εt *C ) τ .

(15)

Now that I have a closed form solution for the optimal tax rate on D relative to
that on C, I can carry out an experiment in comparative statics and consider the effect of
an increase in government expenditures (G) on the level of the second-best optimal tax
rates as well as on the amount of environmental quality in equilibrium. Before turning to
this experiment, however, I note a few points about the optimal tax rates in (15). First,
suppose that environmental tax revenues are sufficient to cover government expenses
without a tax on the clean good (t*C = 0) . In this case, the tax on D (as well as the
difference, tD-tC) exactly equals τ. This is the Pigouvian rule in a first-best situation.
Second, even if a tax on C is required, the first best rule still holds so long as ε equals
zero. Third, if neither of these conditions hold, then the Pigouvian tax increment

(t

)

− t *C falls short of τ so long as εtC is positive. This confirms Bovenberg and de

Mooij's result but avoids any possible confusion that might arise from implicit taxation of
the dirty good through a tax on labor.
III. The Impact on the Environment of Increasing Government Revenue
Given the optimizing behavior described in the last section, I now turn to
comparative statics. Imagine that the government needs to raise additional distortionary
tax revenues to finance an expansion of government services. A natural question to ask is
what happens to the difference between the Pigouvian tax increment ( t *D − t *C ) and social

3

Equation (15) and the government budget constraint in equation (10) will pin down both tax rates. I am
only concerned here with the Pigouvian tax increment t D -tC.

marginal damages (τ), a "price" question, as noted in the introduction. 4 An early reading
of the Double Dividend literature might suggest that this increment should rise as revenue
needs rise. 5 Instead, as we shall see, the increment falls. This suggests that the increase
in required government revenues will lead to a dirtier environment (a "quantity"
question), a concern presumably of greater interest to environmentalists than tax rates,
per se. On the contrary, as I'll show below, the increase in required revenues likely leads
to a cleaner environment.
Let me now turn to the policy experiment and these two questions. 6 Specifically,
I investigate how an increase in required distortionary taxes to finance an increase in G
changes 1) the Pigouvian tax increment ( t *D − t *C ) and 2) the optimal amount of
environmental quality (E). Note that the diversion of resources from the private to the
public sector directly affects the environment to the extent that public services themselves
may pollute more than the mix of private goods reduced. For example, if public services
are entirely clean, the expansion of the government sector will likely lead to a cleaner
environment since the increased government output has no impact on the environme nt.
To avoid this demand side effect, I assume that government spends its revenue on the

4

I treat G as an exogenous parameter while the tax rates are set in an optimal fashion. In other words,
some political process leads to a choice of G and conditional on that choice, tax authorities set tax rates to
minimize deadweight loss.
5
For example consider this quotation from Repetto et al. (1992): "Taxes on these environmentally
damaging activities [resource waste, pollution, and congestion] would not distort economic decisions, but
rather would correct existing distortions" (page 2). Following this logic, the greater the distortion, the
higher the tax rates on polluting activities.
6
In a recent paper, Gaube (1998) considers a slightly different experiment. He compares environmental
quality in a first-best relative to a second-best optimum and finds that environmental quality is higher in the
second-best optimum. To obtain this result, he restricts utility to be quasi-linear in private consumption,
leisure, the government good, and the environment. This restriction is stronger than the restrictions on
preferences in this model. Instead of looking at two disparate points, this paper looks at small changes to
address the question of the impact of increased tax distortions on environmental quality.

same mix of clean and dirty goods as does the private economy. 7 In other words, dirty
government output is a fraction of G equal to

γG ≡

(17)

πD
G
πC + π D

where γ is the fraction of G that is dirty. Recall that π C (π D) is the share of C (D) in total
production. Environmental quality will increase if ND + γG decreases. Differentiating
this expression, environmental quality will increase if

(1 − π G )D̂ + π G Ĝ < 0

(18)

where π G = G/NhL and π C + π D + π G = 1.
For the purposes of measuring the general equilibrium effects of an increase in G,
equations (7), (8), and (10) continue to hold. Equation (11) now becomes

φ( t̂ C + θ C Ĉ) + (1 − φ)( t̂ D + θ D D̂) = π G Ĝ.

(11')
Equation (12) becomes
(12')

L̂ = π C Ĉ + π D D̂ + π G Ĝ .

Finally, conditional on G, equation (15) relating the optimal taxes on the clean and dirty
goods continues to hold. Differentiating this equation yields
(19)

1+ tC
t̂ D = (1 − ετ)
 1+ t D


t̂ C .


These six equations can be solved for changes in C, D, L, tC, tD, and w as functions of Ĝ .
Let me first consider the question of the impact of an increase in G on the
Pigouvian tax increment. From equation (15) we see that
(20)

7

d(tD-tC) = -ετdtC

This is the approach taken in Harberger (1962) to rule out demand side effects in his classic analysis of

8

and the Pigouvian tax increment will fall if the tax rate on C rises as G increases.
Rewrite (15) as t* D = τ + (1-ετ)t* C and note that the sign of dtD equals the sign of dtC
if 1 − ετ >0. With a high range estimate of ε equal to 0.5, the expression 1-ετ will be
positive so long as τ < 2, or that the social marginal damages of pollution do not exceed
twice the production cost of the dirty good. I'll assume that this condition holds. 8 If we
rule out any Laffer tax effects, then sgn(dtD) = sgn(dtC ) = sgn(dG) > 0. With dtC > 0,
equation (20) indicates that the Pigouvian tax increment falls as G rises (so long as ε > 0).
An increase in required distortionary tax revenues does not favor increased taxation of
the dirty good relative to the clean good.
The intuition underlying this result is quite simple. Sandmo (1975) showed that
the optimal tax on a polluting good is a weighted average of a Ramsey component and
marginal environmental damages (MED). As government revenue needs increase, the
weight on the Ramsey component rises and the weight on the environmental component
falls. With separability between leisure and consumption goods, the optimal Ramsey
components on the two goods are equal. Thus an increase in the Ramsey weight leads to
a decrease in the difference between the two tax rates (i.e. the Pigouvian tax increment).
Having answered the "price" question, I now turn to the "quantity" question.
Recall that environmental quality rises if (1 − π G )D̂ + π G Ĝ < 0 (equation (18)). Some
simple manipulation of the six equations in our system shows that
(21)

(1 − π G ) Dˆ + π G Gˆ = π C σ (tˆC − tˆD ) + Lˆ .

the incidence of the corporate income tax. I thank Don Fullerton for suggesting this approach.
8
This condition also ensures that tD > τ (see Schob (1997) for an argument that this will hold).

9

Thus, dE > 0 ⇔ π C σ( t̂ C − t̂ D ) + L̂ < 0. The first term on the right hand side of (21) is
positive, since the Pigouvian tax increment falls, 9 and the second term is negative since
labor supply falls in response to the lower real wage. 10 The first term is a substitution
effect. As the Pigouvian tax increment falls, consumers will substitute from C to D. The
strength of this effect depends on the elasticity of substit ution in consumption (σ). The
substitution effect will work towards reducing environmental quality. The second term is
an output effect and reflects the fact that the increase in taxation will lead to a substitution
away from both produced goods towards leisure. Since leisure is a clean commodity, this
effect serves to improve environmental quality. Whether an increase in government
spending financed by increased taxes leads to a fall or rise in environmental quality
depends on the relative size of the substitution and output effects. 11
To get a feel for the relative importance of the substitution and output effects,
consider the following numerical example where I assume an economy with the
characteristics listed in Table 1. 12

1 + t C 
 t̂ C ≡ Ωt̂ C where Σ < 1 since t D > t C and 1-ετ < 1. Thus
t̂ D = (1 − ετ) 
1+ t D 
t̂ D − t̂ C = ( Ω − 1) t̂ C < 0.

9

10

The real wage falls since the optimal taxes on both C and D increase. See equation (9).
Bovenberg and van der Ploeg (1994) carry out a similar exercise and derive an equation similar to
equation (21). See Table 4 in that paper. The advantage of this derivation is that 1) it abstracts from any
demand side effects, 2) the formula is considerably more transparent, and 3) I can easily provide some
numerical results to show the relative magnitude of the two effects (see below).
12
See Fullerton and Metcalf (2000) for a justification for these assumptions.

With these parameter values, the optimal tax rates are t* C = 0.27, t* D = 0.55, and the
Pigouvian tax increment is 0.28 < τ. Now consider a 10 percent increase in required
government revenue. The Pigouvian tax increment falls by .0066. This induces a
substitution effect equal to 0.005. Meanwhile, the output effect equals -0.015, so the total
effect is -0.010. In other words, the 1.5 percent fall in labor supply will more than offset
the substitution effect, and pollution falls by 1 percent. 13 Table 2 presents a range of
estimates of the impact of a 10 percent increase in required revenue on the Pigouvian tax
increment while Table 3 shows the impact on the amount of pollution, for differing
values of σ and ε:

The improvement in environmental quality depends importantly on the relationship between leisure and
pollution. I have made the extreme assumption that leisure is an entirely clean activity. This is clearly not
entirely accurate. Changing this assumption does not alter my main message: no conclusion can be drawn
as to changes in the amount of environmental quality given a particular change in the Pigouvian tax
increment.

The Pigouvian tax increment falls in every case while environmental quality nearly
always rises. Only in the case of an elasticity of substitution equal to 2 combined with a
low labor supply elasticity (0.15) does the increased revenue requirement fail to reduce
pollution. In all other cases, pollution falls between .3 and 2.1 percent.
IV. Conclusion
This note has accomplished two goals. First, it has confirmed in a simple model
that the optimal incremental tax on pollution lies below social marginal damages with
pre-existing distorting taxes and that the optimal environmental tax increment falls as
government revenue needs rise. Second, I have shown that an increase in government
revenue needs has two offsetting impacts on the environmental quality. For reasonable
parameter values, environmental quality improves despite the decrease in the Pigouvian
tax increment.
This result evokes Atkinson and Stern's analysis of public good provision in a
second best world. The first part of their paper focused on how the Samuelson Condition
for pure public goods is altered in the presence of distortionary taxation. That question is
analogous to the current focus on the relationship between the environmental tax
increment (tD-tC) and social marginal damages (τ). Atkinson and Stern then pointed out
that answering the question of how the Samuelson Condition changes (a price question)
tells us nothing about the optimal provision of the public good (a quantity question).
12

Similarly, here learning that the optimal tax increment falls increasingly short of social
marginal damages as the need for distortionary taxes rises does not imply that
environmental quality must fall as revenue needs increase. On the contrary, a quite
plausible result is a cleaner environment. In short, the focus on tax rates is misleading,
and attention should be paid to how pollution itself is altered by changes in the need for
distorting taxes.
