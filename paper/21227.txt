The Long-Term Effects of Hedge Fund Activism

NBER Working Paper No. 21227

ABSTRACT
We test the empirical validity of a claim that has been playing a central role in debates on corporate
governance—the claim that interventions by activist hedge funds have a negative effect on the long-term
shareholder value and corporate performance. We subject this claim to a comprehensive empirical
investigation, examining a long five-year window following activist interventions, and we find that
the claim is not supported by the data.
We find no evidence that activist interventions, including the investment-limiting and adversarial
interventions that are most resisted and criticized, are followed by short-term gains in performance
that come at the expense of long-term performance. We also find no evidence that the initial positive
stock-price spike accompanying activist interventions tends to be followed by negative abnormal
returns in the long term; to the contrary, the evidence is consistent with the initial spike reflecting
correctly the intervention’s long-term consequences. Similarly, we find no evidence for pump-anddump patterns in which the exit of an activist is followed by abnormal long-term negative returns.
Our findings have significant implications for ongoing policy debates.

INTRODUCTION
Hedge fund activism is now a key aspect of the corporate landscape. Activists have been
engaging with and influencing major American companies, and the media has been increasingly
referring to the current era as the “golden age of activist investing.” 1 The increase in hedge fund
activism, however, has been meeting with intense opposition from public companies and their
advisers, creating a heated debate. 2 Is hedge fund activism a catalyst of beneficial changes that
legal rules and corporate arrangements should facilitate? Or are such activists short-term opportunists that are detrimental to long-term value creation and that legal rules and corporate
arrangements should discourage? This paper aims to advance this debate by putting forward
empirical evidence that resolves some of the key underlying disagreements. Our findings have
important implications for ongoing policy debates on activism and the rights and role of
shareholders.
We focus on the “myopic-activists” claim that has been playing a central role in debates over
shareholder activism and the legal rules and policies shaping it. According to this claim, which
we describe in detail in Part I, activist shareholders with short investment horizons, especially
activist hedge funds, push for actions that are profitable in the short term but are detrimental to
the long-term interests of companies and their long-term shareholders. 3 The problem, it is
claimed, results from the failure of short-term performance figures and short-term stock prices to
reflect the long-term costs of actions sought by activists. As a result, activists with a short
investment horizon have an incentive to seek actions that would increase short-term prices at the
expense of long-term performance, such as excessively reducing long-term investments or the
funds available for such investments.

The myopic-activists claim has been put forward by a wide range of prominent writers. Such
concerns have been expressed by significant legal academics, noted economists and businessschool professors, prominent business columnists, important business organizations, business
leaders, and top corporate lawyers. 4 Furthermore, those claims have been successful in
influencing important public officials and policy makers. For example, Leo Strine Jr. and Jack
Jacobs, two prominent Delaware judges, have expressed strong concerns about short-sighted
interventions by activists. 5 And concerns about intervention by activists with short horizons
influenced the SEC’s decision to limit use of the proxy rule adopted in 2010 to shareholders that
have held their shares for more than three years. 6
The policy stakes are substantial. Invoking the long-term costs of activism has become a
standard move in arguments for limiting the role, rights, and involvement of activist
shareholders. 7 In particular, such arguments have been used to support, for example, allocating
power to directors rather than shareholders, using board classification to insulate directors from
shareholders, impeding shareholders’ ability to replace directors, limiting the rights of
shareholders with short holding periods, tightening the rules governing the disclosure of stock
accumulations by hedge fund activists, and corporate boards’ taking on an adversarial approach
toward activists. 8
Even assuming that capital markets are informationally inefficient and activists have short
investment horizons, the claim that activist interventions are detrimental to the long-term

interests of shareholders and companies does not necessarily follow as a matter of theory. 9 The
claim is thus a factual proposition that can be empirically tested. However, those advancing the
myopic-activists claim have thus far failed to back their claims with large-sample empirical
evidence, relying instead on their (or others’) impressions and experience. 10
In this Article, we conduct a systematic empirical investigation of the myopic-activists
claim, focusing on interventions by activist hedge funds. We find that the myopic-activists claim
is not supported by the data.
Prior to our work, financial economists had already put forward evidence that Schedule 13D
filings—public disclosures of the purchase of a significant stake by an activist—are accompanied
by significant positive stock-price reactions as well as followed by subsequent improvements in
operating performance. 11 However, supporters of the myopic-activists claim have dismissed this
evidence, asserting that improvements in operating performance are short-lived and come with
the cost of subsequent declines in performance and, furthermore, that short-term positive stock
reactions to disclosures of an activist stake merely reflect inefficient market prices that fail to
reflect the costs of the long-term declines in performance. Thus, in a widely circulated
memorandum of the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Martin Lipton, a prominent
supporter of the myopic-activists claim, argued that the important question is, “[f]or companies
that are the subject of hedge fund activism and remain independent, what is the impact on their
operational performance and stock-price performance relative to the benchmark, not just in the

Rev. 1637, 1660–76 (2013) [hereinafter Bebchuk, Myth] (analyzing conceptual structure of myopicactivists claim and showing myopic-activists claim does not follow from assuming existence of inefficient
capital markets and short activist horizons).

short period after announcement of the activist interest, but after a 24-month period,” and
challenged those supporting activism to study this important question. 12
In this Paper, we meet this challenge. Going beyond the twenty-four-month period, we study
how operational performance and stock performance relative to the benchmark evolve during the
five-year period following activist interventions. We find that the empirical evidence does not
support the predictions and assertions of supporters of the myopic-activists claim.
Our analysis is organized as follows. Part I discusses the myopic-activists claim we
investigate and the substantial policy stakes involved. Part II then describes our dataset and the
universe of about 2,000 activist interventions that we study. Our study uses a dataset consisting
of the full universe of approximately 2,000 interventions by activist hedge funds during the
period from 1994 to 2007. For each activist engagement, we identify the “intervention time” in
which the activist initiative was first publicly disclosed (usually through the filing of a Schedule
13D). We track the operating performance and stock returns for companies during a long
period—five years—following the intervention time. We also examine the three-year period that
precedes activist interventions and the three-year period that follows activists’ departures.
Part III focuses on operating performance. We find that activists tend to target companies
that are underperforming relative to industry peers at the time of the intervention. Most
importantly, there is no evidence that activist interventions produce short-term improvements in
performance at the expense of long-term performance. During the long, five-year window that
we examine, the declines in operating performance asserted by supporters of the myopic-activists
claim are not found in the data. Indeed, while lack of long-term declines in performance is
sufficient for rejecting the myopic-activists claim, we find evidence, especially when assessing
performance using the standard measure of Tobin’s Q, that performance is higher three, four, and
five years after the year of intervention than at the time of intervention.
Part IV then turns to stock returns following the initial stock-price spike that is well known
to accompany activist interventions. We first document that, consistent with the results obtained
with respect to pre-intervention operating performance, targets of activists have negative
abnormal returns during the three years preceding the intervention. We then proceed to examine
whether, as supporters of the myopic-activists claim believe, the initial spike in stock price
12.

reflects inefficient market pricing that fails to reflect the long-term costs of the activist
intervention and is therefore followed by stock-return underperformance in the long term. Using
each of the three standard methods used by financial economists for detecting stock-return
underperformance, we find no evidence of the asserted reversal of fortune during the five-year
period following the intervention. The long-term underperformance predicted by the myopicactivists claim, and the resulting losses to long-term shareholders, are not found in the data.
Part IV also analyzes whether activists cash out their stakes before negative stock returns
occur and impose losses on remaining long-term shareholders. In particular, we examine whether
targets of activist hedge funds experience negative abnormal returns in the three years after an
activist discloses that its holdings fell below the 5% threshold that subjects investors to
significant disclosure requirements. Again using the three standard methods for detecting
abnormal stock returns, we find no evidence that long-term shareholders experience negative
stock returns during the three years following an activist’s departure.
Part V next turns to analyze the two subsets of activist interventions that are most resisted
and criticized. One subset consists of interventions that lower or constrain long-term investments
by enhancing leverage, increasing shareholder payouts, or reducing investments. The other
subset consists of adversarial interventions employing hostile tactics. In both cases, the long-term
declines in performance asserted by opponents are not found in the data.
Part VI examines whether activist interventions render targeted companies more vulnerable
to economic shocks. In particular, we examine whether companies targeted by activist
interventions during the three years preceding the financial crisis were hit more in the subsequent
crisis. We find no evidence that pre-crisis interventions by activists were associated with greater
declines in operating performance or higher incidence of financial distress during the financial
crisis.
Part VII discusses the significant implications that our findings have for policy debates. In
particular, we discuss several ongoing debates in which the myopic-activists claim has been
playing a key role and that should thus be informed by our findings. A rejection of the myopicactivists claim should weigh against arguments for limiting the rights and involvement of
shareholders in general or activist shareholders in particular by using staggered boards, avoiding
reforms of corporate elections, and tightening the disclosure rules governing stock accumulations
5

by activist investors. Furthermore, rejecting the myopic-activists claim weighs against corporate
boards’ taking an adversarial attitude toward activist interventions.
Since early versions of this study started circulating, it has already had a significant effect on
the ongoing debate on hedge fund activism. About fifty pieces discussing the study have been
published by, among others, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Economist, and the
Harvard Business Review. 13 Still, our study has also attracted significant resistance from
opponents of activism, who have criticized our study and called for a reliance on the “depth of
real-world experience” of business leaders rather than on any empirical studies. 14 In responses
that we issued to such critiques, 15 and in the course of this Article, we explain that our study

addresses the methodological criticism raised in these critiques and that empirical evidence
provides a superior tool for assessing the myopic-activists claim than anecdotes or self-reported
impressions of business leaders. 16 Below, we seek to contribute to the literature by providing
empirical evidence that could inform the ongoing debate and a foundation on which subsequent
empirical work can build.
I. THE MYOPIC-ACTIVISTS CLAIM
This Part discusses the myopic-activists claim that this Paper aims to test empirically. Part
I.A describes the claim and its conceptual structure. Part I.B highlights the need for testing the
empirical validity of the claim.
A. The Claim
Hedge fund activists might seek a wide range of actions in the strategy and management of a
company. They might propose, for example, divesting assets, changing investment or payout
levels, altering the capital structure, or replacing the CEO. 17 In recent cases that received some
attention, for example, activist investors David Einhorn and Carl Icahn urged Apple to increase
distributions to shareholders, 18 and hedge fund Elliott Management urged Hess to undergo major
structural changes. 19 Because developing an operational change often requires first acquiring a
substantial amount of company-specific information, activists often hold a significant stake in

the company and hope to benefit from the appreciation in the value of the stake that would result
from implementing the change. 20 In addition to seeking such “operational” changes, hedge fund
activists often seek governance changes in how the company is run or personnel changes in its
leadership. 21
Critics of such activist interventions have long put forward the myopic-activists claim that
the actions being sought are overall (or on average) value decreasing in the long term even when
they are profitable in the short term. Such concerns have been expressed by a broad range of
prominent authors, including legal academics, economists and business-school professors,
business columnists, business leaders, business organizations, and corporate lawyers. 22
Then-Chancellor Strine described the essence of the myopic-activists claim advanced by
critics as follows: “[I]n corporate polities, unlike nation-states, the citizenry can easily depart and
not ‘eat their own cooking.’ As a result, there is a danger that activist stockholders will make
proposals motivated by interests other than maximizing the long-term, sustainable profitability of
the corporation.” 23

in activism depend on its stake in a portfolio company.”).

In a similar account of the claim, Harvard Business School professor and former Medtronic
CEO William George stated that the essential problem is that activists’ “real goal is a short-term
bump in the stock price. They lobby publicly for significant structural changes, hoping to drive
up the share price and book quick profits. Then they bail out, leaving corporate management to
clean up the mess.” 24
Critics of hedge fund activism also express concerns about certain types of changes that
might be induced by myopic activists. They worry, for example, that myopic activists will
pressure companies to make cuts in “research and development expenses, capital expenditures,
market development, and new business ventures, simply because they promise to pay off only in
the long term.” 25 They also argue that activist investors use their power “to sway and bully
management to . . . meet the quarterly targets and disgorge cash in extra dividends or stock buy
backs in lieu of investing in long-term growth.” 26
The myopic-activists claim that is the focus of this Paper should be distinguished from
another claim that opponents of activism make. According to what might be referred to as the
counterproductive-accountability claim, 27 the fear of shareholder intervention (or even removal
by shareholders) in the event that management fails to deliver good short-run outcomes leads
management itself to initiate and take myopic actions—actions that are profitable in the short
term but detrimental in the long term. This counterproductive-accountability claim, and the
empirical evidence against it, are discussed in detail in another paper by one of us. 28 In this
Paper, however, we focus exclusively on the myopic-activists claim.

The impact that supporters of the myopic-activists claim have had is, in our view, at least
partly due to the alleged gravity of the concerns that some of them have raised. Some opponents,
for example, have argued that shareholder activists “are preying on American corporations to
create short-term increases in the market price of their stock at the expense of long-term value” 29
and that pressure from short-term activists “is directly responsible for the short-termist fixation
that led to the [2008–2009] financial crises.” 30 The gravity of asserted concerns has registered
with prominent Delaware judges; then-Justice Jacobs, for example, has accepted that the
influence of short-term activists “has created a national problem that needs to be fixed.” 31
The significance of the myopic-activists claim is also due to its wide-ranging implications.
As the Introduction notes, and is discussed in detail in Part VII, the myopic-activists claim has
been playing a critical role in attempts to limit the rights and involvement of shareholders in
many contexts. Therefore, an empirical resolution of the validity of this claim would have
substantial implications for various significant policy debates.

B. The Need for Evidence
Supporters of the myopic-activists claim believe that stock market prices are sometimes
informationally inefficient and are thus set at levels that do not represent the best estimate of
long-term share value that can be derived from all available public information. 32 These
supporters also stress that activist investors commonly have short horizons. 33 As one of us has
shown in prior work, however, the myopic-activists claim does not follow from assuming that
capital markets are often inefficient and that activists often have short investment horizons.34 To
be sure, with inefficient market pricing and short investor horizons, it is theoretically possible
that activists might, in some cases, want companies to act in ways that are not value maximizing
in the long term. However, it is far from clear how often such cases arise. Furthermore, such
cases might be outweighed by cases in which activists have a clear interest in seeking actions
that are positive both in the short term and the long term.
Thus, the myopic-activists claim is, at best, a contestable proposition that might or might not
be valid and should be supported by evidence. However, rather than backing up the myopicactivists claim with a study of the financial performance and stock prices of companies several
years after an activist intervention, opponents of activism have stressed that their belief in the
myopic-activists claim is strongly confirmed by their own experience or the experience of
corporate leaders; Martin Lipton, for example, wrote that his short-termism concerns are based
on “the decades of [his] firm’s experience in advising corporations.” 35 Indeed, in a memorandum
responding to this Paper, Wachtell Lipton urged reliance on the “depth of real-world experience”
of corporate leaders rather than on empirical evidence. 36 Similarly, some other critics of this
32.

See, e.g., Bratton & Wachter, supra note 22, at 691–94 (stating that financial markets are not
efficient and surveying related literature); Lipton & Rosenblum, Quinquennial Election, supra note 22, at
208–10 (arguing that the stock market is generally inefficient by referring to economic literature
accepting stock market can and does misprice stocks).
33. See, e.g., Strine, Fundamental Question, supra note 5, at 8–11 (“[M]any activist investors hold
their stock for a very short period of time . . . . What is even more disturbing than hedge fund turnover is
the gerbil-like trading activity of the mutual fund industry . . . .” (footnote omitted)).
34. Bebchuk, Myth, supra note 9, at 1660–76 (analyzing implications of assuming capital markets are
often inefficient and activists often have short investment horizons).
35. Wachtell Memorandum, Bite the Apple, supra note 10.
36. Wachtell Memorandum, The Bebchuk Syllogism, supra note 14. In a subsequent memorandum,
Wachtell Lipton attempted to argue that, although it did not rely on empirical evidence in advancing the

11

Paper faulted us for questioning the views of “wise people, with loads of practical experience,”
and their “collective judgment that activist interventions are detrimental,” and argued that
“policymakers should weight the experience and expertise of knowledgeable people rather than
tortured statistics.” 37
In our view, however, arguments and policy decisions should not be based on anecdotes,
reported individual experience, and felt intuitions concerning long-term outcomes. Advocates of
reliance on the reported impressions of corporate leaders would surely oppose policymakers’
relying on claims by leaders of activist hedge funds that activist interventions are beneficial if
these claims were based solely on the leaders’ professed experience. Furthermore, relying on
self-reported impressions is especially unwarranted for a claim that is clearly testable using
objective and available data.
The myopic-activists claim asserts propositions concerning the financial performance and
stock returns of public firms. Data about such financial performance and stock returns are
available and widely used by financial economists. Using such data enables subjecting claims
about financial performance and stock returns to a rigorous and objective test.
Even if some business leaders genuinely believe in the validity of the myopic-activists
claim, policymakers and institutional investors should accept the claim as valid only if it is
supported by the data. An empirical examination is thus essential for assessing the myopicactivists claim. We provide such an examination below.

myopic-activists claim, there are in fact twenty-seven studies listed in the memorandum that support this
claim. Wachtell Memorandum, Empiricism and Experience, supra note 14. An analysis of these twentyseven studies that we conducted, however, found that none of them provides evidence that is inconsistent
with our findings. See Bebchuk et al., Still Running Away from the Evidence, supra note 15 (conducting
this analysis).

II. THE UNIVERSE OF HEDGE FUND ACTIVISM
Our empirical examination of the myopic-activists claim in this Paper builds on the dataset,
covering the period from 2001 to 2006, used in the first comprehensive study of hedge fund
activism published by two of us, along with Frank Partnoy and Randall Thomas. 38 This dataset
was also used by the same authors in subsequent work. 39 Two of us, with Hyunseob Kim,
extended the data to include 2007 in a subsequent study 40 and presented an updated sample
covering the period from 1994 through 2007 in a more recent paper focusing on the effects of
activism on plant productivity and capital reallocation. 41 The three of us, working with Robert
Jackson, have recently used this dataset to study predisclosure accumulations of stock by hedge
fund activists. 42 Thus, this database has proven fruitful for previous analyses of several issues,
and in this Article, we extend the use of this database to study the long-term effects of hedge
fund activism.
The dataset includes information drawn from disclosures required to be filed under Section
13(d), which are typically made on the SEC’s Schedule 13D. 43 To begin, the dataset was
constructed by first identifying all of the investors that filed Schedule 13Ds between 1994 and
2007. Then, based on the names and descriptions of the filers required to be disclosed under Item

43. See SEC, Form of Schedule 13D, 17 C.F.R. § 240.13d-101 (2014) (requiring investors to file with
SEC within ten days of acquiring more than 5% of any class of securities of a publicly traded company if
they have interest in influencing company’s management under section 13(d) of 1934 Securities
Exchange Act).

2 of Schedule 13D, 44 filer types such as banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and other
nonactivist investors were excluded from our sample. In addition, based on the description of the
purpose of the investment required to be included in Item 4, 45 events where the purpose of the
investor is to be involved in a bankruptcy or reorganization due to financial distress, the purpose
of the filer is to engage in merger- or acquisition-related risk arbitrage, or the security in which
the investment is made is not a common share, were also excluded.
In addition, the dataset includes the results of extensive news searches, conducted using the
hedge fund and company names drawn from Schedule 13D. These searches allow for the
inclusion in the dataset of additional information not available in the Schedule 13Ds, such as the
hedge fund’s motive and the target company’s response. 46 Due to these searches, the dataset
includes instances in which hedge funds maintained an activist position in a large public
company but owned less than 5% of the company’s stock (and, thus, were not required to file a
Schedule 13D). 47
In this Paper, we use this dataset of activist interventions to provide the first systematic
evidence on the long-term effects of hedge fund activism. 48 To this end, we supplement the

See id. (requiring description of “name[,] principal business[,] [and] address of principal office” of

filer).
45.

See id. (requiring investors to disclose “[p]urpose of [t]ransaction,” including, inter alia, any plans
relating to acquisition of additional stock or corporate event such as merger or acquisition).
46. The researchers putting together the dataset conducted extensive news searches in Factiva using
the hedge fund and target company names as key words, plus a general search using various combinations
of “hedge fund” and “activism” as key words. They further checked the completeness of the news search
using the Thomson Financial Form 13F database. For a detailed description of the construction of this
database, see Brav et al., Hedge Fund Activism, supra note 17, at 1736–39.
47. Because of the significant amount of capital required to own 5% or more of the stock of a large
public company, relying exclusively on Schedule 13D filings might exclude cases in which outside
investors maintained significant holdings of stock. Thus, our sample includes forty-two events in which
the activist hedge fund did not file a Schedule 13D because it held less than 5% of the stock of the target
company. For further discussion of this issue, see Brav et al., Hedge Fund Activism, supra note 17, at
1738–39. For a more detailed description of the procedure for assembling this dataset, see Brav et al.,
Hedge Fund Activism: A Review, supra note 11, at 193–95.
48. While putting together a dataset such as the one we use requires significant work, other teams of
researchers who wish to redo or refine our analysis can do so following the description of the construction
of the dataset in Brav et al., Hedge Fund Activism, supra note 17, at 1736–39. Indeed, various teams of
researchers have already put together, and used in their empirical work, large datasets of activist

14

dataset of activist filings with data on operating performance and stock returns of the companies
targeted by activist interventions. We use standard sources—Compustat for operating
performance data and Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) for stock return data. This
enables us to study the long-term effects of activist interventions on both operating performance
and shareholder wealth.
In particular, we seek to study long-term results during the five years following the activist
intervention. We use data on the operating performance and stock returns of public companies
through the end of 2012. Thus, because 2007 is the last year for which we have data on interventions, we have data on the stock return and operating performance of public companies during
the five years following each of the activist events in our dataset. In the analysis below, we track
each company for up to five years and for as long as it remains public within that period. 49
Table 1 below provides summary data on 2,040 Schedule 13D filings by activist hedge funds
during the period from 1994 to 2007. As Table 1 shows, there has been an increase in the
frequency of activist hedge fund filings over time. Furthermore, except for the first two years,
1994 and 1995, the dataset includes more than ninety filings for each year in the fourteen-year
period of our study.
The dataset described in this section has two features that make it especially useful for the
study of our subject. First, it is comprehensive and includes all hedge fund activist interventions
during a substantial period of time, thus avoiding the questions that could arise if one were to use
a sample or otherwise select a subset of interventions. Second, with over 2,000 interventions in
the dataset, the large number of observations facilitates statistical testing.

interventions. For such studies issued recently, see, e.g., Hadiye Aslan & Praveen Kumar, The Product
Market Effects of Hedge Fund Activism 1–2 (n.d.) (unpublished manuscript) (on file with the Columbia
Law Review) (describing authors’ dataset of activist interventions); Gantchev et al., supra note 28, at 10–
12 (same); Krishnan et al., Top Hedge Funds and Shareholder Activism 11–12 (Vanderbilt University Law
Sch. Law & Econ. Working Paper 15-9, 2015), available at www.ssrn.com/abstract-2589992 (on file with
the Columbia Law Review) (same).
49. The 2013 version of this Paper was based on a dataset that did not include the 2012 Compustat
data, which were not available when this dataset was put together. Thus, the dataset that we now analyze
includes data, which were initially missing, on the operating performance of 2007 targets in their fifth
year of operation after the intervention.

III. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
This Part presents our findings concerning the operating performance of firms targeted by
activists during the five-year period following the activist intervention. Part III.A describes the
standard metrics of operating performance, Q and ROA, used in our study. Part III.B provides
summary statistics; in particular, it shows that the industry-adjusted Q and ROA of target firms
are on average higher during each of the five years following the intervention than at the
intervention time. Part III.C presents a regression analysis of the evolution of operating
performance during the five-year period following the intervention. Part III.D extends the
regression analysis to control for levels of past performance. Finally, Part III.E discusses the
interpretation of our findings; in particular, we explain why the clear pattern of post-intervention
improvements in long-term operating performance identified in this Part is unlikely to be driven
by firms that are acquired or otherwise delisted before the end of five years, or mere stock
picking by hedge fund activists.
A. Metrics of Performance
The metric of operating performance to which we pay closest attention is Tobin’s Q. Named
after Nobel Laureate James Tobin, Tobin’s Q is the metric most commonly used by financial
economists for studying the effectiveness with which firms operate and serve their shareholders,
and numerous peer-reviewed studies have used this metric for assessing the efficiency of

16

governance arrangements, ownership structures, or investor protection rules. 50 Tobin’s Q, often
referred to as “Q” for simplicity, is designed to reflect a company’s success in turning a given
book value of assets into market value accrued to investors. 51 The design of Q enables it to
reflect the aggregate effects through all channels that a given arrangement, structure, or event has
on the value accruing to investors.
We also use ROA throughout as another metric for operating performance. ROA refers to
return on assets—the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to the
book value of assets—and it has been significantly used by financial economists as a metric for
operating performance. 52 ROA reflects the earning power of a business and thus the effectiveness
with which the firm uses assets of a given book value to generate earnings for investors. We note
that activist interventions could improve performance and thereby shareholder value in ways
other than through increasing the earnings of assets in place—such as through changing the
company’s mix of assets or investments. Therefore, of the two metrics we use, Q is probably the
one that is most informative regarding a firm’s performance and prospects. 53
50. For studies that use Tobin’s Q for analyzing the efficiency of governance arrangements, ownership
structures, or investor protection rules, see, e.g., Robert Daines, Does Delaware Law Improve Firm
Value?, 62 J. Fin. Econ. 525, 527 (2001); Paul Gompers, Joy Ishii & Andrew Metrick, Corporate
Governance and Equity Prices, 118 Q. J. Econ. 107, 109–10 (2003) [hereinafter Gompers et al., Corporate
Governance and Equity Prices]; Larry H.P. Lang & René M. Stulz, Tobin’s Q, Corporate Diversification,
and Firm Performance, 102 J. Pol. Econ. 1248, 1250 (1994); John J. McConnell & Henri Servaes,
Additional Evidence on Equity Ownership and Corporate Value, 27 J. Fin. Econ. 595, 596 (1990);
Randall Morck, Andrei Shleifer & Robert W. Vishny, Management Ownership and Market Valuation: An
Empirical Analysis, 20 J. Fin. Econ. 293, 294 (1988); David Yermack, Higher Market Valuation for Firms
with a Small Board of Directors, 40 J. Fin. Econ. 185, 186–87 (1996).
51. Tobin’s Q is measured as the ratio of market value of equity and book value of debt to the book
value of equity and book value of debt. For a discussion of Tobin’s Q and its definition, see Gary Smith,
Tobin’s Q, in 8 The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics 316, 316–17 (Steven N. Durlauf & Lawrence
E. Blume eds., 2d ed. 2008).
52. For studies that use ROA as a metric of operating performance, see, e.g., Lucian A. Bebchuk,
Alma Cohen & Charles C.Y. Wang, Learning and the Disappearing Association Between Governance and
Returns, 108 J. Fin. Econ. 323, 341 (2013); Gompers et al., Corporate Governance and Equity Prices,
supra note 50.
53. A memorandum issued by Wachtell Lipton criticizes the analysis of this section on the grounds
that Tobin’s Q and ROA are imperfect metrics for measuring operating performance. Wachtell
Memorandum, The Bebchuk Syllogism, supra note 14. While no metric of operating performance is
viewed by financial economists as perfect, we chose these two methods because their use as operating

17

Because industries differ significantly in their levels of Q and ROA, financial economists
commonly look at a firm’s industry-adjusted level of Q or ROA—that is, the difference between
the firm’s level and the industry’s mean or median level. 54 A positive level of industry-adjusted
Q or ROA indicates that the firm outperforms its industry peers on this dimension, and,
conversely, a negative level indicates underperformance.
B. Operating Performance Following Activist Interventions
We begin by looking at the operating performance of firms that experienced an activist
intervention at different points in time relative to the time of the intervention. In particular, we
examine operating performance during the five-year period following the intervention.
Table 2 below reports the levels of Q and ROA at such different points in time. The column
labeled t refers to performance in the year of the intervention. Columns labeled (t+1), (t+2), and
so forth represent years after the intervention. We initially report just raw figures that are not
adjusted for the industry. For each year, we report the average and the median level of the metric

performance metrics is standard among financial economists working on corporate governance issues.
Indeed, Wachtell does not advocate any particular alternative metric or argue that we failed to make the
best possible choices in a world with imperfect metrics for operating performance.
Interestingly, Wachtell Lipton seems to have no problem with studies that rely on Tobin’s Q to reach
conclusions Wachtell Lipton favors; it commended as “impressive empirical work” a recent study by
Cremers et al. that relies on Tobin’s Q to argue that staggered boards are desirable. See Martin Lipton,
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, New Empirical Studies Support Director-Centric Governance (Dec. 8,
2013), available at www.wlrk.com/webdocs/wlrknew/WLRKMemos/WLRK/WLRK.22995.13.pdf (on

(unpublished manuscript), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=2364165 (on file with the Columbia Law
Review) (using Tobin’s Q to assess desirability of staggered boards).
In criticizing the use of Q, Wachtell Lipton notes an unpublished paper by Philip Dybvig and Mitch
Warachka. Wachtell Memorandum, The Bebchuk Syllogism, supra note 14; see Philip H. Dybvig & Mitch
Warachka, Tobin’s Q Does Not Measure Firm Performance: Theory, Empirics, and Alternatives 3 (Jan. 7,
2015) (unpublished manuscript), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1562444 (on file with the Columbia
Law Review) (criticizing standard use of Tobin’s Q). These authors discuss potential imperfections in the
use of Tobin’s Q and suggest two alternative metrics of operating performance that, to the best of our
knowledge, have not yet been used by any other empirical study that has been published or made
available on SSRN since the Dybvig–Warachka paper was first placed on SSRN in 2010.

Governance and Equity Prices, supra note 50, at 126.

across our sample. We note that Q is highly right skewed, which results in average Q exceeding
median Q, and that ROA is highly left skewed, which results in average ROA below median
ROA.
TABLE 2: OPERATING PERFORMANCE OVER TIME—NO INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT
This Table reports the levels of Q and ROA of target companies from the targeting (t) to five years
afterwards (t+5). Both variables are constructed using data from Compustat. Panel A reports the average,
the standard error, the median, and the number of observations for the Q of target firms at each point of
time. Q is defined as the sum of the market value of equity and book value of debt (including both shortterm and long-term debt), scaled by the sum of the book value of equity and book value of debt. Panel B
reports the same summary statistics for ROA, where ROA is defined as a firm’s EBITDA (earnings before
interests, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) scaled by the average value of the firm’s assets in the
current and previous year. For both Q and ROA, if the value for the lagged assets is missing, the
denominator becomes the current year assets. Both variables are recorded at the end of the company’s
fiscal year and are winsorized at the 1% extreme in the full Compustat sample.55

The evidence in Table 2 does not support the patterns feared by those advancing the myopicactivists claim—that is, an initial spike in operating performance followed by a decline to below
intervention-year levels. Panel A shows that, focusing on average Q as a metric of operating
performance, average Q exceeds its event year level at (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) and reaches its

winsorizes—that is, limits extreme values in—operating performance results. We winsorize at the 1% and
99% extremes, using the full sample of all Compustat firms from 1991 to 2012 to define extremes.

highest level at (t+5). 56 Panel B in turn indicates that average ROA also exceeds its event year
level at (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) and reaches its highest level at (t+5).
Note that, like peer companies of similar size and performance, many of the target firms stop
being public companies during the five-year period that we examine, and data about their
operating performance are no longer available on Compustat after their delisting. In particular,
within five years, targets of activist interventions have “attrition” rates of about 49%, with most
of the disappearances from Compustat due to acquisitions. When we compare the target firms to
peer companies matched by size and performance, we find that the matched firms also have a
high attrition rate of 42% within five years; most disappearances from Compustat are again due
to acquisitions. While we focus on the operating performance of the companies that remain
public and for which data on Compustat are available, we explain in Part III.E.2 that doing so is
unlikely to result in an overstatement of targets’ operating performance following the
intervention.
As noted in Part III.A, researchers commonly base their analyses not on “raw” levels of Q
and ROA but rather on industry-adjusted levels; performance is best assessed in comparison to
the company’s industry peers. 57 After identifying for each company the firms with the same SIC
three-digit industry classification (SIC3), we define the industry-adjusted level of Q and ROA as
equal to the difference between the raw Q or raw ROA level and the industry average Q or

56.

In Table 2, the pattern of improvement is sharper when one examines averages rather than
medians. Wachtell Lipton incorrectly criticizes us for failing to stress the difference in Table 2 between
results using means and results using medians. Wachtell Memorandum, The Bebchuk Syllogism, supra
note 14 (noting that “averages can be skewed by extreme results”). However, Table 2 merely presents
summary statistics of “raw” levels, and we do not stress or rely on any of its results for our conclusions.
As we explain below, the standard approach by financial economists is to control by industry. In our
subsequent Table 3, which presents summary statistics using industry-adjusted levels, the results are in
fact similar using both means and medians; in both cases, industry-adjusted operating performance,
measured by either Tobin’s Q or ROA, is higher in each of the five years following the intervention year
than during the intervention year. Furthermore, and most importantly, our conclusions are primarily based
on a regression analysis, not on the summary statistics of Tables 2 and 3, and our regression analysis (see
infra Tables 4 and 5) uses standard methods for avoiding excessive influence of outlier observations.

ROA. 58 Table 3 below presents the evolution of average industry-adjusted Q and ROA over time
among the targets of hedge fund activists. As before, we report levels for the intervention year
and each of the five years following the intervention year.
TABLE 3: INDUSTRY-ADJUSTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE OVER TIME
This Table reports the industry-adjusted Q and ROA of target companies from the year of targeting (t) to
five years afterwards (t+5). Each performance measure, industry-adjusted Q or ROA, is defined as its
value in excess of the average value of all firms from the same SIC three-digit industry classification.
When using three-digit industry classification results in fewer than five firms, we use two-digit SIC
classification or, if using two-digit SIC industry classification also provides fewer than five firms, onedigit industry classification.

Table 3 indicates that targets of activist interventions tend to underperform at the time of the
intervention. In the year of intervention, both the average industry-adjusted Q and the average
industry-adjusted ROA are negative. 59 Furthermore, and most importantly for the purposes of our
inquiry in this Paper, Table 3 displays clear patterns of improved operating performance relative
to industry peers during the five years following activist interventions.
58. Industry average levels differ somewhat from industry median levels because both Q and ROA are
skewed. Because Q is significantly skewed to the right, industry average tends to be higher than the
median. Because ROA is significantly skewed to the left, industry average tends to be lower than the
median.
59. In addition, note that the median industry-adjusted Q and the median industry-adjusted ROA are
also both negative.

21

As Panel A shows, the average industry-adjusted Q increases over time during the five-year
period following the intervention year. Furthermore, average industry-adjusted Q is higher in
each of the five years following the intervention than in the year of intervention, and the increase
during the five years is of significant magnitude relative to the underperformance at the time of
the intervention.
Panel B displays a similar pattern with respect to average industry-adjusted ROA. The
average industry-adjusted ROA increases over time during the five-year period following the
intervention year. Indeed, average industry-adjusted ROA is higher in each of the five years
following the intervention than in the year of intervention. Furthermore, the increase closes most
of the underperformance relative to industry peers at the time of the intervention.
Finally, Figure 1 displays graphically the results presented in Table 3. In particular, the
Figure plots the evolution of industry-adjusted ROA and industry-adjusted Q in the five years
following the intervention. The graphs vividly display the increasing patterns of Q and ROA
during the years following the intervention.

We now turn to a regression analysis of the evolution of ROA and Q over time. This analysis
enables us to control for other factors that might be relevant and to assess the statistical
significance of our results.
1. Baseline Specifications
Panel A of Table 4 below displays the results of four regressions. In columns (1) and (2), we
run a regression in which the dependent variable is Q. The adjustment for industry performance
is made by including industry- (or firm-) fixed effects (FE). In both regressions, we include as
explanatory variables dummy variables representing the year of intervention as well as each of
the subsequent five years. 60 In the regressions reported in Table 4, and all subsequent regressions,
we cluster the standard errors at the firm level unless otherwise noted. 61
As controls, we use in both regressions the company’s market value and age, 62 year-fixed
effects to account for time trends in the values of Q and the impact of macroeconomic factors,
and dummy variables for each of the three years preceding the intervention year. In regression
(1), we include industry-fixed effects. As a result, the coefficients on the key variables (t),
(t+1), . . . , (t+5) should be interpreted as a “difference-in-difference.” It is as if we take a
difference of each firm-year Q against the average level of all firms in the same year and also
60.

The regressions of Table 4 use over 130,000 observations because we have an observation for
each combination of a Compustat firm and one of the years from 1994 (the first year in which
interventions in our dataset start) and 2012 (five years after the last year in which such interventions take
place). Seeming unfamiliar with how such a regression analysis is conducted, Allaire and Dauphin attack
the large number of observations in our Table 4 as suspiciously “far-fetched” and “staggering.” See
Allaire & Dauphin, Lasting Wealth, supra note 37, at 11 (questioning large numbers of observations).
Allaire and Dauphin also criticize other practices that are standard in empirical work in financial
economics.
61. For a widely cited article recommending such clustering, see Mitchell A. Petersen, Estimating
Standard Errors in Finance Panel Data Sets: Comparing Approaches, 22 Rev. Fin. Stud. 435 (2009).
62. For studies suggesting that performance is related to company age, see Rajshree Agarwal &
Michael Gort, Firm Product Life Cycles and Firm Survival, 92 Am. Econ. Rev. (Papers & Proc.) 184, 190
(2002); Steven Klepper, Entry, Exit, Growth, and Innovation over the Product Life Cycle, 86 Am. Econ.
Rev. 562, 562–63 (1996). Company size is a standard control. We include age and size, but not
characteristics that are a function of management choice such as leverage or capital expenses, because
these are the policies that activists might seek to change and thus we should not make inferences premised
on their being constant.

23

against the average level of all firms in the same industry over all years. We then estimate the
difference between the industry-and-year-adjusted Q of firms targeted in the current and next
five years and that of the nontarget firms while holding constant company size and age.
In regression (2), we include a dummy for each firm, running a firm-fixed effect regression,
to account for time-invariant factors unique to each firm. Under such a specification, the
coefficients on the key variables, (t), (t+1), . . . , (t+5), should be interpreted as the excess performance of a target firm, during years (t) to (t+5), over its own all-time average and adjusted for
market-wide conditions (due to the year-fixed effects). Firm-fixed effects automatically subsume
industry-fixed effects.
In columns (3) and (4), we run regressions that are identical to those in (1) and (2)
respectively except that the dependent variable is now ROA rather than Q. Thus, regression (3)
includes industry-fixed effects and regression (4) includes firm-fixed effects.
The results of the regressions are consistent with the view that targets of activist
interventions tend to underperform at the time of the intervention. The coefficient of the event
year is negative in each of the four regressions and is statistically significant at the significance
level of 5% or stronger in three of these four regressions. These results are consistent with target
firms performing below their own “normal” levels at the time of intervention.
Most importantly for the purposes of our inquiry in this Paper, there is no evidence for the
post-intervention decline in operating performance feared by those making the myopic-activists
claim. Indeed, in each of the four regressions, each of the coefficients for the dummy variables
representing the years (t+1), (t+2), (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) is higher than the coefficient for the
event year. Furthermore, in each of the regressions, the coefficients for the dummy variables
representing the years keep trending up, relative to the coefficient of the time of intervention,
during the five-year period we examine, consistent with the view that operating performance
improves through the end of this period relative to the performance level at the time of
intervention.

24

TABLE 4: EVOLUTION OF ROA AND Q OVER TIME
Panel A of Table 4 reports the results (coefficients and t-statistics in the parentheses) from linear
regressions where the dependent variables are Q (columns (1) and (2)) and ROA (columns (3) and (4)), as
defined in Table 2. The sample includes all firm-year observations from Compustat from 1991 to 2012.
The independent variables of key interest are dummy variables, (t+j), (j = 0, 1, . . . , 5), which are equal to
one if a firm was targeted by activist hedge funds in j years prior to the current year. Year (t) is the year of
intervention. Control variables include pre-event dummies (t–j), (j = 1, 2, 3), which are equal to one if a
firm is targeted by activist hedge funds (j) years going forward; “ln(MV),” which is the logarithm of a
firm’s market capitalization at a given year-end; and “ln(Age),” which is the logarithm of the number of
years since the firm’s first appearance in the merged CRSP/Compustat database. All regressions include
yearly dummies. Columns (1) and (3) further include SIC3 industry-fixed effects, while columns (2) and
(4) include firm-fixed effects. Panel B of Table 4 reports the F-statistics and the associated p-value from
two sets of F-tests: One set tests for the equality of the coefficients of (t+j), (j = 3, 4, and 5), and those of t
(the event year), and the second set tests for the equality of the coefficients of year (t+j), (j = 3, 4, and 5),
and those of year (t–1) (the year preceding the event year). All standard errors adjust for
heteroskedasticity as well as clustering at the firm level. Finally, *, **, and *** indicate statistical
significance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively.

Because the myopic-activists claim we investigate focuses on long-term changes in
operating performance, we pay special attention to the coefficients for (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5)—
that is, three, four, and five years after the year of interventions. In particular, for each of the four
regressions, we conduct two sets of F-tests: one for the difference between each of these
coefficients and the coefficient of the event year t, and one for the difference between each of
these coefficients and the coefficient of the year (t–1) that precedes the intervention year.
Because both Q and ROA are recorded at the end of the year, the time in which metrics for year t
are measured comes after, and the time in which metrics for year (t–1) are measured comes
before, the exact time in which the occurrence of the intervention is disclosed. We therefore
make comparisons both relative to (t) and (t–1) performance metrics.

26

Panel B indicates that, in the twelve F-tests we conduct for the two Q regressions, each of
the (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) coefficients is higher than the event-year coefficient and the positive
difference increases from years three to five. 63 Furthermore, the positive difference is statistically
significant at the 1% significance level in each of the twelve F-tests that we conduct. Thus, firm
valuation is not pulled down by declining performance in years three to five following the
intervention but is rather significantly higher than during the time of the intervention.
Turning to the twelve F-tests we conduct for the two ROA regressions, Panel B indicates that
each of the (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) coefficients is higher than the event year coefficient and that
the positive difference is statistically significant in nine out of the twelve F-tests we conduct,
with significance at the 1% significance level in six out of these F-tests. We note, however, that
the positive changes in ROA are less economically significant than the positive changes in Q.
One explanation for the difference might be that some of the identified long-term improvements
in firm valuation come from channels other than increasing the earning on existing assets.
Thus, whether the comparison is to the end of the intervention year or the preceding year,
and whether using Q or ROA, the results of Table 4 are inconsistent with the view that activist
interventions are associated with short-term gains during the first two years that cannibalize
performance in subsequent years. The evidence does not support the myopic-activists claim that
activist interventions are, during the five-year window following intervention, followed by longterm declines in performance.
Finally, looking at the coefficients for the pre-intervention years used as controls (not
tabulated), we find that, in three of the four regressions, these coefficients decline from (t–3) to
the event year (t). Indeed, F-tests conducted for these three regressions indicate that the
difference between the event year coefficient and the (t–3) coefficient is negative and significant
at a significance level of 5% or stronger. This suggests that the operating performance of the
target of an activist intervention was trending in a negative direction during the period preceding
the intervention and that the intervention was followed by a reversal of this trend.

63. Consistent with Q at the end of the year of the intervention already reflecting the expectations for
subsequent improvements in operating performance, the comparison to the (t–1) coefficients yields higher
positive differences than the comparison to the t coefficients.

27

2. Using High-Dimensional Fixed Effects
For robustness purposes, we re-run the regressions reported in Table 4 substituting the
industry and year fixed effects with the higher dimensional fixed effects and further add firmfixed effects to the specifications in regressions (2) and (4). The use of year-fixed effects in the
regressions of Table 4 enables netting out the average Q or ROA that is observed in a given year
measured across all industries, and the use of industry-fixed effects enables netting out an
industry average effect measured across all sample years. By replacing the two types of fixed
effects with ones that are unique to each industry and year combination, using fixed effects that
are unique to each industry and year combination, we enable accounting for the Q (or ROA) that
is observed for a given industry in a given year. By further adding firm fixed effects, we analyze
the dynamics of performance that adjust for the “normal” level of each firm benchmarked against
industry peers in a given year. This estimation procedure, which allows multiple highdimensional fixed effects, follows the one put forward recently by Guimarães and Portugal. 64
Panel A of Table 5 below reports our results. Columns (1) and (3) of Table 5 report the
results of regressions that use a fixed effect for all observations that belong to a given SIC threedigit industry and are in the same year. There are 5,869 SIC3 × year dummy variables for this
specification. Columns (2) and (4) further add firm-fixed effects (Firm FE), introducing 22,067
additional dummy variables representing unique firms that existed during the sample level. The
inclusion of many layers of fixed effects is expected to reduce the power of our tests to detect
abnormal performance, and results obtained using this procedure should therefore be assessed in
light of this higher hurdle for finding statistical significance.

The specification used in columns (1) and (3) compares targeted firms to control firms in the
same year belonging to the same SIC3 industry; and the corresponding F-tests in Panel B of
Table 5 test whether the same industry-year benchmark-adjusted improvement in performance
during years three to five following intervention (relative to the year (t) or the year (t–1)) is
statistically significant. The specification used in columns (2) and (4) provides one more layer of
differencing against a firm’s own normal level (i.e., all-time average); and the corresponding Ftests in Panel B of Table 5 test whether the within-firm improvement in years three to five is
significant after adjusting for the same industry-year benchmark.
The results in Table 5 are similar in magnitude and statistical significance to those of Table
4, suggesting that Table 4’s findings are robust to the inclusion of high-dimensional-fixed effects.
All regressions indicate positive changes in Q and ROA post intervention. For Q regressions, the
coefficients of years three, four, and five remain higher than both the coefficient of year (t) and
30

the coefficient of year (t–1), and the positive differences are economically meaningful and
statistically significant at the 1% significance level in all twelve F-tests we conduct. For ROA
regressions, these differences in coefficients are positive in all F-tests and significant in six out of
the twelve F-tests we conduct. Thus, the overall results of Table 5 reinforce the conclusions of
Table 4 that the asserted adverse effect on long-term performance is not supported by the data.
D. Controlling for Past Performance
As we have seen, target firms are underperforming at the time of intervention, and it might
be suggested that post-intervention improvements are driven by initial underperformance that
provides room for improvement or facilitates reversion toward the mean. 65 In this section we
therefore examine whether our results are robust with respect to controlling for prior
underperformance. To this end, we extend the regressions reported in Tables 4 and 5 to control
for past performance.
In particular, for each of the regressions in Tables 4 and 5 used to assess performance
improvement during a given period since the time of intervention and employing an F-test, we
add a lagged performance variable where the time lag matches the given period. More formally,
when we analyze the performance improvement in year (t+j) relative to (t) (or (t–1)), we add the
performance (j) years (or (j+1) years) ago into the regression. For example, in order to test the
difference between Q at (t+3) and Q at (t), we add the Q value of the same firm three years ago
to the regression as an additional control variable. Thus, the estimated improvement in the
performance in three years post-intervention controls for the performance of both target and
control firms three years prior to the point of assessment.
We further vary the specifications of the regressions by different combinations of industry,
firm, and year fixed effects using the various specifications employed in Tables 4 and 5. Table 6
below reports the results. In addition to the added lagged performance variable, columns (1) and
65.

See John C. Coffee, Jr. & Darius Palia, The Impact of Hedge Fund Activism: Evidence and
Implications 5–6 (European Corporate Governance Inst., Working Paper No. 266, 2014), available at
http://ssrn.com/abstract= 2496518 (on file with the Columbia Law Review) (discussing usefulness of
taking into account initial underperformance of activists’ targets). Wachtell Lipton also expresses concern
that our work does not sufficiently take into account that the targets of activism tend to be
underperforming at the time of intervention. Wachtell Memorandum, The Bebchuk Syllogism, supra note
14.

(4) use industry- and year-fixed effects following the specifications in columns (1) and (3) of
Table 4; columns (2) and (5) use firm- and year-fixed effects following the specifications in
columns (2) and (4) of Table 4; and columns (3) and (6) use high-dimensional-fixed effects that
are unique to each industry and year combination following the specifications of columns (1) and
(3) of Table 5. Because each F-test is derived from a unique regression, we do not report the
numerous regressions we run but only the results from the F-tests. For each F-test, we report the
difference between the coefficients on (t+j) and (t) (or (between (t+j) and (t–1)), the F-statistics,
and the associated p-value.
The results in Table 6 indicate that the results reported by Tables 4 and 5 are robust with
respect to controlling for performance at the time of intervention. For the Q regressions, the
coefficients of (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) are higher than both the coefficient of t and the coefficient
of (t–1), and the differences are positive and statistically significant at the 1% significance in all
the eighteen F-tests that are reported in Table 6. For the ROA regressions, these differences are
positive in all the eighteen F-tests that we conduct and are statistically significant in ten out of
these eighteen F-tests at the 5% significance level and in one other F-test at the 10% significance
level. Thus, the results reported in Table 6 indicate that the conclusions reached in the preceding
section are robust with respect to control for past performance.
The potential issue of “mean reversion” might be most relevant when a target firm was at
bottom performance levels among industry peers. To address this issue, we ran another set of
regressions. In particular, we re-ran the regressions of Table 6 replacing the lagged performance
control with a dummy variable indicating whether the lagged performance was at the bottom
quartile in the industry-year group. 66 The (untabulated) results are either very similar to or
stronger than those reported in Table 6, and they thus further confirm that our findings are robust
with respect to controlling for past performance.

66. We classify the industry at the SIC three-digit level if there are at least eight firms in the industry
during the year—so that the quartile is well defined—and use the SIC two-digit classification if the SIC
three-digit level includes fewer than eight firms.

TABLE 6: CONTROLLING FOR PAST PERFORMANCE
This Table reports the results of the F-tests for the differences between the coefficients on (t+j), (j =3, 4,
5), and the coefficients on year (t) or year (t–1) (as the case may be) from regressions that extend those
reported in Table 4 and Table 5 to control for past performance. Each F-test is from a unique regression.
In each regression, the dependent variable (Q or ROA); the key independent variables, (t), (t+1), . . .
(t+5); and the control variables are the same as in Table 4, including ln(MV), ln(Age), and the pre-event
dummies (t–j), (j = 1, 2, 3), which are equal to one if a firm is targeted by activist hedge funds (j) years
going forward. In addition, we add one lagged performance variable (Q or ROA) in year (t–j) (or (t–j–1)),
in a regression that tests the difference between (t+j) and (t) (or (t–1)). For example, in order to test the
difference of (t+3) vs. (t) for Q, we add Q(t–3) (i.e., the Q value of the same firm three years ago) to the
regression as an additional control variable. We further vary the specifications of the regression by a
different combination of industry, firm, and year fixed effects, as reported at the bottom on the table. For
economy of space, the regression coefficients are suppressed. For each F-test conducted, we only report
the difference of the coefficients, the F-statistics, and the associated p-value. All standard errors adjust for
heteroskedasticity as well as clustering at the firm level. Finally, *, **, and *** indicate statistical
significance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance level, respectively.

The potential issue of “mean reversion” might be most relevant when a target firm was at
bottom performance levels among industry peers. To address this issue, we ran another set of
regressions. In particular, we re-ran the regressions of Table 6 replacing the lagged performance
control with a dummy variable indicating whether the lagged performance was at the bottom
quartile in the industry-year group. 67 The (untabulated) results are either very similar to or
stronger than those reported in Table 6, and they thus further confirm that our findings are robust
with respect to controlling for past performance.
E. Interpreting Our Findings
1. A Clear Pattern
The analysis of the preceding sections of this Part establishes a clear pattern. To begin,
activists do not generally target well-performing companies. Targets of activism tended to be
companies whose operating performance was below industry peers and also their own historical
levels at the time of intervention. Moreover, at the time of the intervention, the targets seemed to
be in a negative trend with operating performance declining during the three years preceding the
intervention.
Furthermore, during the five years following the intervention, we find no evidence
supporting concerns that activist interventions are followed by short-term gains that come at the
expense of subsequent long-term declines in operating performance. Examining both Q and
ROA, and conducting comparisons both to the end of the year following the intervention and the
end of the year preceding it, the feared adverse effect on long-term performance is not found in
the data. Indeed, in each of the years three, four, and five following the intervention, we find
improvements that are statistically significant. Thus, overall, the evidence on firm performance
does not support the myopic-activists claim.
2. Adverse Effect on the Post-Acquisition Performance of Acquired Firms?
As is the case with peer companies, a significant percentage of targeted firms are no longer
public by the end of the five-year period, having been acquired or otherwise delisted, and are
67. We classify the industry at the SIC three-digit level if there are at least eight firms in the industry
during the year—so that the quartile is well defined—and use the SIC two-digit classification if the SIC
three-digit level includes fewer than eight firms.

34

thus no longer part of the Compustat dataset of public company data. Because our results
indicate that targets’ operating performance improves for as long as they remain public, it might
still be argued that activism has an adverse effect on targets that stop being public during the
five-year period, that this effect occurs after these targets are no longer public and thus is not
detected by our analysis, and that this adverse effect is sufficiently large to make the effects of
activism overall negative in the aggregate. 68
However, there is no reason to expect that the operating performance of targets that are
acquired will be more likely to decline rather than improve post-acquisition. Indeed, acquisitions
can often be expected to be motivated by the acquirer’s expectation that it will be able to
improve the performance of the purchased assets through synergies or otherwise. To the extent
that this is the case, it can be expected that the performance of assets of activism targets that are
acquired will tend to improve, rather than decline, after the targets are acquired and stop having
their operating performance reported on Compustat.
Furthermore, as explained below, this concern is directly addressed by a recent empirical
study, co-authored by two of us and Hyunseob Kim, that tracks the operating performance of
activism targets after they are acquired. 69 That study uses U.S. Census Bureau’s longitudinal
databases of manufacturing businesses to study activism at targets engaged in manufacturing. A
key attribute of the Census data is that the Census continues to record data on manufacturing
assets previously belonging to a public company even after the company stops being public due
to an acquisition or otherwise. 70 The study is therefore able to assess directly, for targets in the

68.

Wachtell Lipton criticizes our study for focusing on the operating performance of companies that
remain independent. Wachtell Memorandum, The Bebchuk Syllogism, supra note 14. While we address
this issue below, it is surprising to have this criticism come from Wachtell Lipton given that, in an earlier
memo, the firm’s founding partner stated that the important question to study, “[f]or companies that are
the subject of hedge fund activism and remain independent,” is “the impact on their operational
performance and stock price performance relative to the benchmark, not just in the short period after
announcement of the activist interest, but after a 24-month period.” Wachtell Memorandum, Bite the
Apple, supra note 10.
69. See Brav et al., The Real Effects of Hedge Fund Activism, supra note 41 (describing empirical
study of activism targets in manufacturing sector that tracks operating performance of their assets over
time even if companies are acquired).

35

manufacturing sector, what changes in operating performance took place in targets that stopped
being public.
The study documents that plants belonging to targets that eventually drop from the
Compustat database perform better than those plants whose firms are still covered by Compustat.
Thus, to the extent that the targets out the manufacturing sector exhibit a similar pattern, the evidence provided by the study indicates that focusing on target firms that remain public should not
be expected to result in an overstatement—and indeed might well generate an understatement—
of the post-intervention performance of targets.
3. Stock Picking?
Finally, critics of hedge fund activism might argue that the identified association between
activist interventions and subsequent improvements in operating performance does not by itself
demonstrate a causal link. It could merely reflect the activists’ tendency to choose targets whose
operating performance is expected to increase in any event. 71 Under such a scenario, the
improvement in long-term performance experienced by targets reflects the activists’ “stock
picking” ability rather than the activists’ impact on the company’s operating performance.
We would like to stress at the outset that accepting that activist interventions are followed by
improvements in operating performance, and merely questioning whether activists should “get
credit” for these improvements, would already concede that the long-term consequences of
activism provide no basis for calls to limit the influence of activism and to insulate boards from
such influence. Such calls have been premised on the claim that activist interventions are
followed by (and bring about) declines in long-term operating performance. To the extent that
interventions are followed by improvements in operating performance, there is no reason to limit
the influence of activists regardless of how much credit they should be getting for these
improvements. Stock pickers who successfully bet on future improvements might not deserve a
medal, but they do not warrant opposition and resistance.
However, there are at least three reasons to believe that the identified improvements in
operating performance are at least partly due to the activist interventions. First, activist

71.

See Wachtell Memorandum, The Bebchuk Syllogism, supra note 14 (“[F]avorable results would
arise . . . whenever managements of the target companies pursue value-enhancing strategies.”).

36

engagements involve significant costs, and activist investors would have strong incentives to
avoid bearing them if they believed that the improvements in performance would ensue in any
event, even without engaging with target companies. In such a case, these investors would just
buy a stake, avoid any intervention, and capture the benefits of the improved performance
expected to take place without incurring costs. Thus, activists’ willingness to bear the significant
costs of engagement likely reflects their judgment that their activities contribute to the
subsequent improvements in operating performance.
Second, as Part V discusses, improvements in operating performance follow activist
interventions not just in our dataset as a whole but also in the subset of activist interventions that
employ adversarial tactics. Such tactics are used when activists expect companies to resist the
activists’ suggested course of action. This finding is in tension with the view that the
improvements in operating performance following activist interventions are due to corporate
actions that incumbents would choose to take even without any intervention.
Furthermore, the view that the interventions contribute to subsequent improvements is
consistent with the finding in earlier work co-authored by two of us (together with Hyunseob
Kim) that such improvements do not take place after outside blockholders pursuing a passive
strategy announce the purchase of a block of shares, but do occur when blockholders switch from
passive to activist stance. 72 This finding is also consistent with the view that the patterns we
identify above are at least partly a product of the activists’ work and not merely a reflection of
their foresight in choosing targets.
We therefore conclude that the identified improvements in performance should be expected
to be at least partly due to the activist intervention. Of course, causality issues in corporate
governance and finance are notoriously difficult to resolve with absolute confidence, 73 and we do
not aim at precise identification of the extent to which the improvements are due to activist
interventions. Our chief interest in this Paper is in investigating empirically whether the longstanding and influential claim that activist interventions are followed by declines in long-term
72.

See Brav et al., The Real Effects of Hedge Fund Activism, supra note 41, at 27–29 (reporting such
findings).
73. See, e.g., Alma Cohen & Charles C.Y. Wang, How Do Staggered Boards Affect Shareholder
Value? Evidence from a Natural Experiment, 110 J. Fin. Econ. 627, 628–29 (2013) (stressing difficulties
involved in resolving questions of causality).

37

operating performance is backed by the evidence. Our results provide a clear answer: This longstanding claim is not supported by the data.
IV. STOCK RETURNS
We now turn to examine the long-term returns to the shareholders of companies targeted by
hedge fund activists. As discussed in Part I.A, opponents of hedge fund activism believe that the
initially positive stock-market reaction to activist interventions represents inefficient, myopic
market pricing that fails to reflect the subsequent negative returns that are experienced by longterm shareholders and make such shareholders worse off. On this view, while activists might
benefit from capturing positive stock-price returns prior to their departure, the negative longterm stock returns that follow their exit leave long-term shareholders holding the bag. In this
Part, we subject these claims to an empirical test.
Part IV.A begins by examining the abnormal stock returns that such shareholders experience
during the forty-day period surrounding the filing of Schedule 13D by an activist hedge fund.
Part IV.B investigates empirically whether these initial gains are wiped out by significant negative returns in subsequent years. Part IV.C examines empirically the long-term returns that
follow the departure of activists. Finally, Part IV.D concludes.
A. Short-Term Returns
We begin by examining the stock-price movements that accompany the announcement of an
activist campaign in our dataset. We thus document the initial stock-price spike that activism
opponents argue to be reversed in the long term.
The initial spike we confirm below has been extensively documented by prior work. This
pattern was first documented in an empirical study co-authored by two of us, 74 as well as in a
study conducted by April Klein and Emanuel Zur. 75 These initial findings were corroborated by

74.

See Brav et al., Hedge Fund Activism, supra note 17, at 1755–57 (finding positive abnormal
returns for twenty-day event windows around filing of Schedule 13D).

three subsequent studies. 76 Furthermore, a recent study documented that disclosures of activist
interventions are accompanied by positive abnormal stock returns in more than twenty stock
markets outside the United States. 77
Although our focus is on long-term results, we begin by confirming this effect in our
extended sample. Figure 2 below describes the average abnormal buy-and-hold returns in a fortyday window surrounding the filing of a Schedule 13D. This period begins twenty days before an
activist hedge fund files a Schedule 13D through twenty days afterwards.

positive and significant abnormal short-term returns (about 5% in a seven-day event window)
accompanied the announcement of changes produced by such engagement. See Marco Becht, Julian

39

As the Figure shows, the average abnormal returns observed during the twenty-day period
before and after an investor files a Schedule 13D are approximately 6%, a magnitude consistent
with the findings in prior work. The initial market reaction to the announcement of an activist
stake views this development as “good news.” And this positive market reaction to the
appearance of a hedge fund activist is consistent with the view that activists provide benefits to,
rather than impose costs on, the targets of their campaigns. 78
Opponents of activism do not contest the clear evidence that activist interventions are
accompanied by positive short-term stock returns but rather dismiss its significance. Martin
Lipton, for example, argued that the important question is, “[f]or companies that are the subject
of hedge fund activism and remain independent, what is the impact on . . . stock price
performance relative to the benchmark, not just in the short period after announcement of the
activist interest, but after a 24-month period.” 79
For hedge fund activism to reduce the wealth of shareholders in the long term, it must be the
case that (i) the elevated stock-price levels following 13D filings represent inefficient market
pricing that fails to perceive the expected long-term costs of the intervention; (ii) as a result, the
initial spike is expected to be followed in the long term by negative abnormal stock returns; and
(iii) these negative returns are so large that they wipe out the initial spike and make long-term
shareholders worse off. We will now turn to empirically assessing these propositions.
B. Subsequent Reversal?
Clearly, the above proposition has empirical implications that make it testable using publicly
available data. Below we engage in such testing. We examine returns to the shareholders of
targets of activist interventions in the five years following the initial stock-price spike
accompanying the intervention. We look for evidence of the asserted long-term reversal that is
believed to make long-term shareholders worse off.

78. A recent study confirms that the significant positive returns accompanying Schedule 13D
announcements continue after our sample period ends in 2007. See Krishnan et al., supra note 48, at 3
(“[T]he announcement period abnormal stock price returns from hedge fund activism are consistently and
robustly high from 2008 through 2014.”).
79. Wachtell Memorandum, Bite the Apple, supra note 10.

In investigating the presence of negative abnormal long-term returns, we employ three
standard approaches used by financial economists to detect underperformance relative to the
risks involved. First, in Part IV.B.1, we examine whether the returns to targeted companies were
systematically lower during the considered five-year period than what would be expected given
standard asset pricing models. Second, in Part IV.B.2, we examine whether the long-term returns
to targeted companies were lower than those of “matched” firms—that is, firms that are similar
in terms of size and book-to-market. Third, in Part IV.B.3, using a portfolio approach, we
examine whether a portfolio that took a position in each targeted company after the 13D
announcement window—and retained this position for the subsequent five years—
underperformed relative to its risk characteristics.
Using each of these methods, we look for evidence of the asserted long-term
underperformance of companies that were the targets of activist interventions. As we discuss
below, we find no evidence for the existence of the asserted long-term negative returns in the
data.
1. Individual-Firm Regressions
We first examine stock returns for each individual firm. Of course, to identify whether stock
returns are abnormally low or high, one needs a benchmark of comparison. Such benchmarks of
comparison are provided by the Capital Asset Pricing Model 80 and the Fama–French–Carhart
asset-pricing model. 81 Each of these standard models provides a framework that enables
identifying “abnormal” returns.
In particular, using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, the standard procedure is to estimate an
“alpha,” the average excess return that is not explained by co-movement with the market. 82
Similarly, using the Fama–French–Carhart four-factor model, the standard procedure is to

80.

82. Specifically, we estimate for each firm (i) an alpha using the regression:
𝑟𝑖𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖1 𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 .

41

estimate an “alpha,” the average excess return that is not explained by the four market-wide
factors identified in seminal works by Fama and French and by Carhart. 83
For each of the firms that were the targets of activist interventions, we estimate a monthly
alpha, or abnormal return, for the three years prior to month of the intervention. In addition, we
estimate monthly alphas for the three years following the month of the intervention and the five
years following the month of the intervention. 84 To the extent that firms delist from the sample,
we incorporate into the performance measurements in this section information on delisting
returns from the Center for Research in Security Pricing (CRSP).
Table 7 below provides results concerning the alphas we calculated. For each of the periods,
we provide both the median and average alpha for all the firms in our sample. We also indicate
the statistical significance of our results; however, as is now well known in the financialeconomics literature, the standard error of the average of the estimated alphas understates the
unobserved variability in performance, and the reported t-stats should thus be treated as merely
suggestive. 85

83.

See sources cited supra note 81 (introducing this model). Specifically, we estimate for each firm
(i) an alpha using the regression:
𝑟𝑖𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖1 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡 + 𝛽𝑖2 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡 + 𝛽𝑖3 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑡 + 𝛽𝑖4 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖 .
We obtain the factor returns and monthly risk-free rates from Ken French’s website at the Tuck
School of Business at Dartmouth College, see Kenneth R. French, Data Library, Tuck at Dartmouth,
http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html (on file with the Columbia Law
Review) (last visited Mar. 28, 2015).
84. We do such estimation for all firms that have a minimum of twenty-four monthly returns
following the intervention (i.e., all firms that remained public for at least twenty-four months following
the month of the intervention) so that there is a significant number of monthly returns on which a
regression can be based. We note that, for the few events in our sample in which the hedge fund did not
file a Schedule 13D, we use the month in which the activism was made public via news searches as the
month of intervention.
85. For a discussion of this problem, see, e.g., Eugene F. Fama, Market Efficiency, Long-Term
Returns, and Behavioral Finance, 49 J. Fin. Econ. 283, 295–96 (1998) [hereinafter Fama, Market
Efficiency].

2. Buy-and-Hold Abnormal Returns
In the preceding analysis, we focus on regression intercepts as estimates of monthly
abnormal performance subsequent to activists’ intervention. We now report average buy-andhold abnormal return as an alternative measure of abnormal performance. 86
TABLE 7: FIRM-LEVEL ESTIMATES OF ABNORMAL RETURNS SUBSEQUENT TO HEDGE FUND
INTERVENTION—USING MARKET-PRICING MODELS
This Table reports statistics on abnormal returns to target firms subsequent to hedge fund activism. For
each firm targeted by a hedge fund activist, we estimate a monthly alpha for three distinct event periods.
The first event period extends from three years prior to the month of the intervention through the month
prior to the intervention; the second and third event periods both begin in the month following the month
of the intervention through either three or five years following the month of the intervention. For the latter
two event periods, we require a minimum of twenty-four monthly returns following the intervention.
Panel A presents average, median, standard deviation, t-statistic, and number of estimated firm alphas for
the CAPM regressions for each of the three event periods. Panel B presents these statistics for the
regressions based on the Fama–French–Carhart four-factor model.

The first column in Table 7 provides our results concerning stock returns during the threeyear period preceding the intervention. Using both the CAPM pricing model and the Fama–
French–Carhart four-factor pricing model, we find an alpha during this period that is negative
and economically meaningful. The monthly abnormal return has a median of -0.25% and an
average of -0.17% in the first pricing model and has a median of -0.40% and an average of 0.28% in the second pricing model. These results, like those concerning operating performance
obtained in Part III, are consistent with the view that hedge fund activists target underperforming
companies.
The second and third columns provide results concerning stock returns during the three- and
five- year period following the intervention. The average of the estimated alpha is positive and
statistically significant when we use both the CAPM model and the Fama-French-Carhart fourfactor model. The results thus fail to provide evidence for the negative returns during these
periods hypothesized by opponents of hedge fund activism.
Specifically, for each event, we compute the buy-and-hold return over a predetermined
holding period after the intervention net of a benchmark return that is meant to capture the event
firm’s expected return. In particular, for each event firm, we use information on its pre-event
market capitalization and book-to-market to match it to one of the twenty-five Fama and French
size and book-to-market value-weight portfolios.
Since the target firm’s market capitalization and book-to-market ratio change over the
subsequent holding period, we allow the benchmark portfolio to change by using the new firm
attributes in every subsequent year. In those cases in which a target firm is missing a book-tomarket ratio in a given year, we impute the value from the previous year and, if missing, two
years earlier. Finally, if a target firm delists prior to the chosen investment horizon, we reinvest
the proceeds in the market portfolio (the Fama and French value-weight portfolio, “RM”) and
similarly reinvest the benchmark return to that point in the market as well.
The results are reported in Table 8 below. The Table provides both equal- and value-weight
average buy-and-hold abnormal return during a long holding period beginning in the first month
post-intervention. As in the preceding subsection, we report results over three- and five-year
holding periods following the month of the intervention.

44

TABLE 8: BUY-AND-HOLD ABNORMAL RETURNS
SUBSEQUENT TO HEDGE FUND INTERVENTIONS
This Table reports statistics on buy-and-hold abnormal returns to target firms subsequent to hedge fund
activism. For each firm targeted by a hedge fund activist, we compute the buy-and-hold return beginning
in the first month post-intervention extending through either three or five years afterwards. For each firm,
we use information on its pre-event market capitalization and book-to-market to match it to one of the
twenty-five Fama–French size and book-to-market value-weight portfolios. To allow for time variation in
expected returns, we allow the benchmark portfolio to change by using the new firm attributes in every
subsequent event year. In those cases in which a target firm is missing a book-to-market ratio in a given
year, we impute the value from the previous year and, if missing, two years earlier. If a target firm delists
prior to the end of the chosen investment horizon, we reinvest the proceeds in the market portfolio (the
Fama and French value-weight portfolio, “RM”) and similarly reinvest the benchmark return to that point
in the market as well. For each event window, we report both equal-weight and value-weight average
abnormal returns, the standard deviation of abnormal returns, and the number of observations.

Consistent with the regression-based evidence presented earlier, the evidence indicates that
the value-weighted buy-and-hold abnormal returns are positive at the three-year holding period
(2.58% over a thirty-six-month period) and the five-year holding period (5.81% over a sixtymonth period), and that equal-weighted buy-and-hold abnormal returns are positive at the threeyear holding period (7.17% over a thirty-six-month period) and are practically zero at the fiveyear holding period (-0.29% over a sixty-month period). While we find positive returns in three
specifications, these positive returns are not statistically significant. 87 Overall, the findings of
Table 8 do not support the view that activist interventions are followed by abnormal negative
long-term returns, and thus stock return underperformance, for the target’s shareholders.

87.

We report the cross-sectional standard deviation of abnormal returns in the column marked “St.
Dev.” However, because long-horizon abnormal returns are likely to be positively correlated, our use of
the cross-sectional standard deviation assuming independence underestimates the true standard error. This
factor further reinforces the conclusion that the positive returns in three specifications are not statistically
significant.

45

3. Portfolio Analysis
Next, we turn to “calendar-time portfolio regressions” in which event firms are grouped into
a portfolio whose abnormal portfolio over time is estimated. For example, we form a [-36, -1]
portfolio beginning in January 1994 by buying all firms that will be targeted by an activist hedge
fund in three years’ time and that are held until the month preceding the intervention before
selling. Similarly, we form a [+1, +36] portfolio by buying all firms that were targeted by a
hedge fund one month earlier and that are held for three years before selling. We form portfolios
with both equal- and value-weighting of firms’ returns.
For each holding period and weighting scheme, we estimate a regression of the resulting
portfolio excess returns on the Fama–French RMRF, SMB, and HML factors and the momentum
factor, MOM. Because the number of events in our sample shows a steady increase over the
sample period, we estimate the regression coefficients using weighted least squares with the
number of events firms in a given calendar month as weights. 88
As in the preceding estimation, we focus on the regression intercept, the portfolio’s alpha, as
evidence of possible mean reversion in prices. Clearly, the portfolio in the pre-event window
does not represent a tradable strategy. It is presented for an ex post analysis of the stock return
patterns of the companies in the pre-targeting period.
Table 9 below provides the regression results. Panel A reports the results of equal-weighted
portfolios, and Panel B reports the results of value-weighted portfolios. “Alpha” is the estimate
of the portfolio intercept. “Beta” is the factor loading on the market excess return (the Fama and
French RMRF). “SMB,” “HML,” and “MOM” are the estimates of factor loadings on the Fama–
French size and book-to-market factors, and the Carhart momentum factor, respectively. We
report t-statistics below the respective point estimates. “R-squared” is the adjusted R2 from the
regressions and “N” is the number of monthly portfolio return observations. We set a minimum
of ten firms per month for all portfolios.

88.

In our setting, such an approach is especially warranted because the number of observations
fluctuates considerably during the years we consider. We also ran our tests without using such weighted
least squares and again did not find any evidence for negative and statistically significant abnormal
returns during the five years following the initial spike.

46

The results in Table 9 indicate that, in both Panel A and Panel B, the returns to activist
targets are highly correlated with the SMB and HML factors, reflecting the fact that targeted
companies co-move with the returns of small firms (firms that are relatively small in size) and
value firms (firms with a relatively high book-to-market value ratio). Hence, by accounting for
size and book-to-market, we are able to control for a significant part of the average return earned
by target firms and thus increase the power of our tests to detect possible underperformance in
the post-intervention period.
With respect to the thirty-six months preceding the intervention, the results reported in Table
9 are consistent with earlier results reported in Table 7 above. Targeted firms underperform in the
three-year period prior to the arrival of activist hedge funds. The monthly abnormal return
(alpha) from the equal weight results in Panel A is similar to the average of the individual target
firm alphas reported in Table 7, Panel B.
With respect to the thirty-six-month and sixty-month periods following the intervention, we
examine post-intervention returns using four specifications. We looked at both equal-weighted
and value-weighted portfolios, and for each we examined both a three-year period and a fiveyear period. The alpha we obtained is positive and economically meaningful in three
specifications (ranging from 0.17% a month to 0.24% a month) and is negative but
economically insignificant (-0.03% a month) in the fourth specification. In all four
specifications, however, the alpha coefficient is not statistically significant. Thus, this testing
approach also finds no evidence for the asserted long-term underperformance of activism targets.
4. Summary
Overall, the analysis of stock returns carried out in this Part provides no support for the
claim that activist intervention makes shareholders of target companies worse off in the long
term. The emerging picture is that, taking a fully long-term perspective, the market does not fail
to appreciate the long-term consequences of activism as insulation advocates fear it does. Rather,
the stock appreciation accompanying activists’ initial announcement reflects the market’s correct
anticipation of the intervention’s effect, and the initial positive stock reaction is not reversed in
the long term. The significant long-term losses to shareholders of activist targets asserted by the
myopic-activists claim are not found in the data.

TABLE 9: ABNORMAL RETURNS SUBSEQUENT TO HEDGE FUND INTERVENTIONS—USING
CALENDAR-TIME PORTFOLIOS
This Table reports statistics on abnormal returns to target firms subsequent to hedge fund activism from
calendar-time portfolio regressions. The portfolio holding “window” indicates the holding period in
months relative to the month of the hedge fund intervention. For example, the portfolio with the holding
period [+1, +36] continually adds target firms that have had an activist event in the preceding month and
holds these firms through three years after their respective activism event. The regression follows the
specification provided in footnote 83. Panel A provides the results based on equal-weight portfolio
regressions, whereas Panel B provides results based on value-weight portfolio regressions. “Alpha” is the
estimate of the regression intercept from the four-factor model. “Beta” is the loading on the market excess
return; SMB and HML are the estimates of portfolio factor loadings on the Fama–French size and bookto-market factors; MOM is the portfolio factor loading on the Carhart momentum factor. “R-squared” is
the adjusted R2 from the regressions. Finally, “N” is the number of monthly observations. We estimate the
regression coefficients employing weighted least squares and using the number of events firms in a given
calendar month as weights. We set a minimum of ten firms per month for all portfolios. Finally, *, **, and
*** indicate statistical significance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels,

C. Pump and Dump?
1. The Question
We now turn to examining long-term returns following the decisions of activist hedge funds
to start liquidating their holdings in the targets. In particular, we examine below whether negative
long-term returns follow such departures and make long-term shareholders worse off.
There is evidence that investors in activist hedge funds have been making significant
positive returns. A study in which two of us participated found that activist investors capture
positive abnormal returns between the month prior to the Schedule 13D filing date and their exit
date, 89 and a subsequent study by Boyson and Mooradian reached a similar conclusion. 90
Furthermore, another study in which two of us participated documented that activist hedge funds
have outperformed the returns of equity-oriented hedge funds of similar size and age. 91
Opponents of activism do not dispute that activist hedge funds and their investors benefit
from activism. Rather, they assert that, while “[a]ctivist hedge funds are reportedly
outperforming many other asset classes,” the value they capture is “appropriated from fellow
stockholders with longer-term investment horizons.” 92 Such divergence in the returns to activists
and long-term shareholders can be expected only if activist hedge funds succeed in getting out
before the stock prices decline. This pump-and-dump view implies that activist targets
experience negative abnormal returns in the years following activists’ departure.
We should note that such negative returns are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for
long-term shareholders to bear losses while activist hedge funds capture positive returns. If
activist hedge funds were to bail out before such negative returns take place, this would imply
that (i) the returns to the long-term shareholders of the targets of activists’ funds must be lower
than (ii) the returns to the activists’ hedge funds themselves. However, in this case, although (i)
would be lower than (ii), (i) might still be positive.

outperformance of activist hedge funds during January 2005–June 2007 period).

49

The existence of the hypothesized negative returns provides another proposition that clearly
can and should have been empirically tested, using publicly available data, by supporters of the
myopic-activists claim. We conduct such a test below.
In particular, we focus on stock returns in the three years that follow an activist’s filing of a
disclosure statement (an amendment to the Schedule 13D) indicating that the activist’s holding
has fallen below the 5% threshold that subjects investors to significant disclosure requirements.
We refer to such partial liquidation of activist stakes as “departures.” 93 We study the long-term
returns during the three years following such departures.
2. Individual-Firm Regressions
We first examine stock returns for each individual firm following the methodology used in
Part IV.B.1 for studying stock returns for each individual firm following activist arrivals. As in
Part IV.B.1, we examine stock returns both compared to the benchmark provided by the Capital
Asset Pricing Model and the benchmark provided by the Fama–French–Carhart asset-pricing
model. For each firm that was the target of activist interventions, we estimate an alpha, or
average abnormal return, for the three years following the month of the activist’s departure. 94
Table 10 below provides results concerning the alphas that we calculated. For each of the
benchmarks, we provide both the median and average alpha for all the firms in our sample. We
also indicate the statistical significance of our results, but we remind the reader that the standard
error of the average of the estimated alphas understates the unobserved variability in abnormal
performance and the reported t-stats should thus be treated as merely suggestive. 95
The results reported in Table 10 indicate that during the three-year period following activists’
departures, estimated alphas are positive and statistically significant at the 1% significance level.
This is the case both for the CAPM model and the Fama–French–Carhart four-factor model.
93.

We note that the time difference between the initial 13D filing and the departure date in our
database of activist interventions has a median of 539 days (about 1.5 years) and an average of 811 days
(over two years).
94. Similarly to what we did in Section V.B.1, we make such an estimation for all firms that have a
minimum of twenty-four monthly returns following the departure so that there is a significant number of
monthly returns on which a regression can be based.
95. See Fama, Market Efficiency, supra note 85, at 294–96 (“[F]ailure to account for the crosscorrelation of event firm returns during long post-event periods can affect inferences . . . .”).

50

Thus, the data provide no support for the pump-and-dump patterns feared by holders of the
myopic-activists view.
TABLE 10: FIRM-LEVEL ESTIMATES OF ABNORMAL RETURNS SUBSEQUENT TO HEDGE FUND
DEPARTURE—USING MARKET-PRICING MODELS
This Table reports statistics on abnormal returns to target firms subsequent to the departure of hedge fund
activists. For each firm targeted by a hedge fund activist with an identified exit date, we estimate a
monthly alpha extending from the month of the activist’s departure through three years afterwards. We
require a minimum of twenty-four monthly returns. Panel A presents average, median, standard deviation,
t-statistic, and number of estimated firm alphas based on the CAPM regressions, and Panel B presents

3. Buy-and-Hold Results
As in Part IV.B.2, we next consider buy-and-hold abnormal return as an alternative measure
of abnormal performance. We follow the same methodology used to produce the results
displayed in Table 8. In particular, we compute the buy-and-hold return over a three-year period
after the activists’ departure net of a benchmark portfolio, with the return and the benchmark
portfolio computed and identified in the ways described in Part IV.B.2.
The results are reported in Table 11 below. As in Table 8, we report the results of both equalweight portfolios in which the results of all targets get an equal weight and the results of value51

weight portfolios in which the results of targets are value-weighted. Consistent with the results
based on individual-firm regressions presented in Table 10, the results in Table 11 indicate that
buy-and-hold abnormal returns are positive. This is the case both when using equal weighting
and when using value weighting. Thus, the results in Table 11 are consistent with the conclusion
that pump-and-dump concerns are not supported by the data.
TABLE 11: BUY-AND-HOLD ABNORMAL RETURNS SUBSEQUENT
TO HEDGE FUND EXIT

This Table reports statistics on buy-and-hold abnormal returns to target firms subsequent to the departure
of hedge fund activists. For each firm targeted by a hedge fund activist with an identified exit date, we
compute the buy-and-hold return beginning in the first month post-departure extending through three
years afterwards. For each event firm, we use information on its pre-departure market capitalization and
book-to-market to match it to one of the Fama–French twenty-five size and book-to-market value-weight
portfolios. To allow for time variation in expected returns, we allow the benchmark portfolio to change by
using the new firm attributes in every subsequent event year. In those cases in which a target firm is
missing a book-to-market ratio in a given year, we impute the value from the previous year and, if
missing, two years earlier. If a target firm delists prior to the three-year investment horizon, we reinvest
the proceeds in the market portfolio (the Fama and French value weight portfolio, “RM”) and similarly
reinvest the benchmark return to that point in the market as well. We report both equal-weight and valueweight average buy-and-hold abnormal returns, the standard deviation of abnormal returns, and the
number of observations.

4. Portfolio Analysis
Finally, as we in Part IV.B.3, we turn to calendar-time portfolio regressions in which event
firms are grouped into a portfolio that is traded in calendar time, and we estimate the portfolio’s
abnormal performance. In particular, we form portfolios by buying all firms that were targeted by
a hedge fund one month after the departure of the activist and hold them for three years before
selling. We form portfolios with both equal and value-weighting of firms’ returns, and we
estimate abnormal returns following the methodology described in Part IV.B.3.

52

Table 12 below provides the results. As before, “alpha” is the estimate of the portfolio
intercept. Panel A reports the results of equal-weighted portfolios and Panel B reports the results
of value-weighted portfolios.
TABLE 12: CALENDAR-TIME PORTFOLIO REGRESSIONS OF ABNORMAL RETURNS SUBSEQUENT TO
HEDGE FUND EXIT
This Table reports statistics on abnormal returns to target firms subsequent to hedge fund activists’
departure from calendar-time portfolio regressions. The portfolio holding “window” indicates the holding
period in months relative to the month of the departure by the activist. The regression takes the form
specified in footnote 82. Panel A provides the results based on an equal-weight portfolio regression,
whereas Panel B provides results based on a value-weight portfolio regression. “Alpha” is the estimate of
the regression intercept from the four-factor model. “Beta” is the loading on the market excess return.
SMB and HML are the estimates of portfolio factor loadings on the Fama–French size and book-tomarket factors. MOM is the portfolio factor loading on the Carhart momentum factor, “R-squared” is the
adjusted R2 from the regressions, and “N” is the number of monthly observations. We estimate the
regression coefficients employing weighted least squares using the number of events firms in a given
calendar month as weights. We set a minimum of ten firms per month for all portfolios. Finally, *, **, and
*** indicate statistical significance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels,
respectively.

The results reported in Table 12 indicate that pump-and-dump patterns are not found in the
data. During the three years subsequent to activists’ exit, the equal-weight portfolio has a
monthly alpha that is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level (0.37% over the thirtysix-month period, t-stat = 2.16), and the value-weight portfolio has a monthly alpha that is
positive and statistically significant at the 10% level (0.31% over the 36-month period, t-stat =
1.81). Thus, like the other two methodologies used earlier, the portfolio approach again fails to
find any evidence in support of the pump-and-dump concerns.

5. Summary
Using each of the three standard methods for detecting abnormal returns—individual firm
regressions based on capital-asset-pricing models, comparison of buy-and-hold returns with
returns on similar firms, and a long-term portfolio analysis—we have found no evidence for the
pump-and-dump view. Following the month of partial cashing out by the activists, there is no
evidence for negative abnormal returns in the subsequent three years. Indeed, returns in this
period are positive, though not always statistically significant, in many specifications.
To the extent that targets earn some positive abnormal returns during this three-year period
following the month of partial liquidation, one might ask why activists would sell some of their
initial stake at this point. The answer might be that the above-market returns are too small to
enable the activists to provide their own investors, after taking out the significant fees charged by
hedge fund activists, with adequate returns; or that the excess return is too modest to justify the
costs associated with the lack of diversification. So the activists choose to move some of their
capital elsewhere.
In any event, analyzing fully the exit strategy of activists is beyond the scope of this Paper.
Our chief interest in this Part is to test empirically the validity of the pump-and-dump claim that
negative long-term returns follow activists’ departures. Using three standard methods for detecting such negative abnormal returns, we find no support of this claim in the data on stock
returns during the three years following such departure.
V. ACTIVIST INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY RESISTED
Our analysis in Parts III and IV focuses on the full universe of activist interventions. In this
Part, we focus on important subsets of activist interventions—those that companies and
opponents of activist interventions seem to be especially concerned about and focused on. We
investigate whether these subsets of interventions exhibit the long-term declines in company
performance feared by opponents of hedge fund activism.
Part V.A focuses on the subsets of interventions that are followed by substantial reductions
in capital investments, substantial increases in leverage, or substantial rises in payout
distributions to shareholders—changes that directly or indirectly reduce the pool of resources
available for the firm’s long-term investments. Part V.B focuses on interventions that are openly

54

adversarial and hostile. In both cases, we find no evidence for the asserted adverse effect on
long-term performance.
A. Investment-Limiting Interventions
Opponents of hedge fund activism and holders of the myopic-activists view focus on and
express concerns about activist interventions that might bring about a reduction in the company’s
long-term investments and the resources available to finance them. 96 Opponents are thus
especially concerned about activism that leads to an increase in leverage or higher payouts to
shareholders, both of which could leave the firm with fewer resources for future investments, or
to direct reductions in capital investments. 97
Opponents view such strategies as “sacrificing the future for a quick buck.” 98 Commenting
on the attempt by activist David Einhorn to persuade Apple to distribute some of its large cash
holdings, for example, one prominent opponent viewed it as a “clarion call for effective action”
against activism that can be expected to have an adverse effect on the long-term interests of
Apple and its long-horizon shareholders. 99
There is no good theoretical basis, however, for presuming that activist-initiated reductions
in investments are value reducing in the long term. Both financial economists and corporate-law
scholars have long recognized management’s tendency to avoid distributing excess cash or assets
to shareholders. 100 Even if a company has excessive cash holdings or investment levels,
96.

See, e.g., Lipton & Rosenblum, Quinquennial Election, supra note 22, at 210 (arguing that
shareholders pressure companies to make cuts in “research and development expenses, capital
expenditures, market development, and new business ventures, simply because they promise to pay off
only in the long term”).
97. See, e.g., Millstein, supra note 26 (arguing activist investors use their power “to sway and bully
management to . . . meet the quarterly targets and disgorge cash in extra dividends or stock buy backs in
lieu of investing in long-term growth”).

100. See Sanford J. Grossman & Oliver D. Hart, Corporate Financial Structure and Managerial
Incentives, in The Economics of Information and Uncertainty 107, 109 (John J. McCall ed., 1982),

55

management might refrain from taking actions that would reduce the size of the empire under its
control or the freedom to pursue projects without the discipline generated by having to raise
outside financing. Thus, opponents of hedge fund activism overlook that reducing cash holdings
and investments might actually move companies closer to, rather than away from, the levels that
are optimal for the long term.
At a minimum, the asserted long-term costs of activism that result in increased leveraged,
higher shareholder payouts, or reduced investment cannot be derived theoretically from the very
nature of such interventions. It is an empirical proposition that should be backed by evidence. In
this section, we therefore turn to testing this proposition.
To this end, we identify a subset of “investment-limiting” activist interventions that are
followed by a substantially increased leverage, higher payouts, or reduced investment by the end
of year (t), (t+1), or (t+2). We focus on changes of this nature that take place by the end of year
(t+2) because we focus on the long-term effect of short-term actions and because changes taking
place by the end of year (t+2) are more likely to be related to the intervention than changes
taking place later on.
In particular, we classify an activist event as “investment-limiting” if any of the following is
true: (i) the increase in leverage from the base year to any of the examined years falls within the
top 5% of leverage increases among all public companies in that year; 101 (ii) the increase in
payout yield (including dividends and share buybacks) from the base year to any of the examined
years falls within the top 5% of payout increases among all public companies in that year; 102 or
(iii) the increase in capital expenditure and R&D from the base year to any of the examined years

flow); Michael C. Jensen, Agency Costs of Free Cash Flow, Corporate Finance, and Takeovers, 76 Am.
Econ. Rev. 323, 323 (1986) (explaining that debt might be necessary to motivate management because
payouts to shareholders reduce resources under managers’ control).
101. Change in leverage is calculated as (Debtr – Debtb)/(Debtb + Equityb), all using book value. The
subscript (b) stands for “base year” while the subscript (r) stands for the “report year” extending from the
event year (t) through event year (t+2). By this criterion, 6.3% of the events fall into the top 5%.
102. Change in payout yield is calculated as [(Dividendr + Repurchaser) – (Dividendb +
Repurchaseb)]/MVb. By this criterion, 9.2% of the events fall into the top 5%.

56

falls within the bottom 5% of all firms in that year (hence decrease in investment in large
magnitude). 103 By “base year,” we refer to the year-end before targeting, that is, year (t–1).
Using the above definition, we find that 19% of the activist interventions fall within the
subset of investment-limiting interventions. 104 To investigate whether the claimed adverse effect
on long-term performance is present for these interventions, we begin by reporting the evolution
of average industry-adjusted Q and average industry-adjusted ROA during the five years
following the activist intervention for this restricted subsample. Similar to what Figure 1 presents
for the whole sample of activist interventions, Figure 3 displays the evolution of industryadjusted Q and industry-adjusted ROA for the set of investment-limiting interventions.

R&D values are imputed as zeros. By this criterion, 5.9% of the events fall into the bottom 5%.
104. Of the interventions classified as allegedly myopic, about one-quarter are classified into that set of
interventions based on two or more of the criteria (i)–(iii) defined in the preceding paragraph.
Coffee and Palia argue that the significant number of investment-limiting engagements that we
identify raises concerns that activism is associated with reduced levels of long-term investments. Coffee
& Palia, supra note 65, at 61–64. However, there is a large body of work in financial economics
suggesting that managers have a tendency to invest excessively and that decreases in investments might
thus move targets toward, rather than away from, optimal investment levels. Bebchuk, Myth, supra note
9, at 1665–66.

57

As Figure 3 shows, within the set of investment-limiting interventions, average industryadjusted Q and average industry-adjusted ROA trend upward during the five years following the
interventions. Indeed, the levels of average industry-adjusted ROA and average industry-adjusted
Q are higher in each of the five years following the intervention than in the intervention year.
Next, we repeat the regression analysis of the evolution of Q and ROA over time that we
conduct in Part III.C, but this time we focus exclusively on investment-limiting interventions. In
particular, we include as event observations only investment-limiting interventions and not the
universe of all activist interventions; we redo the regressions and accompanying F-tests as
reported in Table 4. Table 13 below displays our results
As in Table 4, columns (1) and (2) report regressions in which the dependent variable is Q,
and columns (3) and (4) report regressions in which the dependent variable is ROA. We control
for “normal” levels by including industry-fixed effects or the finer firm-fixed effects. In all
regressions, we include as explanatory variables dummy variables representing the year of
intervention as well as each of the subsequent five years. We also include as control variables the
same controls as those used in the corresponding regression in Table 4. Among other things,
regressions (1) and (3) include industry-fixed effects and regressions (2) and (4) include firmfixed effects.
As Table 13 indicates, we find no evidence that investment-limiting interventions are
associated with adverse long-term declines in operating performance. Indeed, in the F-tests we
conduct for the two Q regressions, each of the (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) coefficients is higher than
either the event year coefficient or the year (t–1) coefficient and the positive differences are
statistically significant in four out of the twelve F-tests. Similarly, in the F-tests for the ROA
regressions, each of the (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) coefficients is higher than either the coefficient of
year (t) or the coefficient of year (t–1), and the differences are statistically significant at a
significance level of 5% or stronger in six out of the twelve F-tests.

FOR THE “INVESTMENT-LIMITING” SUBSAMPLE

This Table follows the same specifications as in Table 4, except that the “target firms” include only the
targets in the “investment-limiting” subsample. An event is classified as “investment-limiting” if any of
the following is true: (i) the increase in leverage from the base year to any of the examined years falls
within the top 5% of leverage increases among all public companies in that year, with change in leverage
calculated as (Debtr – Debtb)/(Debtb + Equityb), all using book value and the subscript (b) standing for
“base year” or the year-end prior to targeting while the subscript (r) stands for the “report year” extending from the event year (t) through event year (t+2); (ii) the increase in payout yield (including dividends
and share buybacks) from the base year to any of the examined years falls within the top 5% of payout
increases among all public companies in that year, with change in payout yield calculated as [(Dividendr
+ Repurchaser) – (Dividendb + Repurchaseb)]/MVb; or (iii) the increase in capital expenditure and R&D
from the base year to any of the examined years falls within the bottom 5% of all firms in that year (hence
decrease in investment in large magnitude), with change in investment calculated as [(Capexr + R&Dr) –
(Capexb + R&Db)]/Assetsb and missing R&D values are imputed as zeros. As in Table 4, all standard
errors adjust for heteroskedasticity as well as clustering at the firm level, and *, **, and *** indicate
statistical significance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively.

Finally, we examine whether improvements in operating performance during postintervention years that targets of investment-limiting interventions enjoy tend to be smaller than
those experienced by other targets of activist interventions. To explore this question, we run
regressions (not tabulated) that follow the specifications of the baseline regressions in Table 4
with the addition of interaction terms for the dummy variables of (t), (t+1), (t+2), (t+3), (t+4),
and (t+5) with a dummy variable for “investment-limiting” interventions. The coefficients of
these interaction terms indicate how the “investment limiting” interventions differ from other
activist interventions. We then conduct joint F-tests to examine whether the post-intervention
improvements in operating performances are different between the investment-limiting
subsample and the complement subsample of other interventions. These results indicate, at the
10% significance level, that the two subsamples are not statistically different in terms of the
magnitude of the post-intervention improvements in operating performance.

60

We conclude that the data do not support the concerns expressed regarding investmentlimiting interventions. 105 We find no evidence that such interventions produce long-term declines
in operating performance and thereby involve “sacrificing the future for a quick buck.” 106
B. Adversarial Interventions
We now turn to another subset of activist interventions that deserve special attention—
interventions that employ adversarial tactics. Hedge fund activists can be expected to use such
tactics when they view companies as likely to be resistant to the direction suggested by them and
therefore deem adversarial tactics as necessary to move the company in this direction. Such
interventions, however, could be viewed by opponents as especially costly and disruptive.
We classify activist interventions as “adversarial” when the initial or amended 13D filing by
the activist threatens or opens the door to a proxy contest, a lawsuit, or public campaigns
involving confrontation. 107 While our classification procedure might miss events that were
hostile behind closed doors, it should avoid type-II errors, that is, treating as adversarial a
nonadversarial initiative. Our set of adversarial interventions accounts for 21.6% of the universe
of all interventions in our regression analysis.
Below we investigate whether the alleged adverse effect on long-term performance is
present in the subset of interventions that are adversarial. As in Part V.A, we first plot in Figure 4
the evolution of average industry-adjusted Q and average industry-adjusted ROA during the five
years following the activist intervention for this restricted subsample.
The picture emerging out of Figure 4 with respect to the set of adversarial interventions is
similar to the one emerging out of Figure 3 with respect to investment-limiting interventions. As
Figure 4 shows, within the set of investment-limiting interventions, average industry-adjusted Q
and average industry-adjusted ROA trend upward during the five years following the
interventions. Furthermore, the level of average industry-adjusted Q and average industry-

Next, we repeat again the regression analysis of the evolution of Q and ROA over time we
conduct in the preceding Part V.A, but this time we focus on adversarial interventions. Table 14
below reports our results. As in Table 13, columns (1) and (2) report regressions in which the
dependent variable is Q; columns (3) and (4) report regressions in which the dependent variable
is ROA; regressions (1) and (3) include industry-fixed effects; regressions (2) and (4) include
firm-fixed effects; and, as in Table 4, controls include the company’s market value and age, yearfixed effects to account for time trends, and dummy variables for each of the three years
preceding the intervention year.
As Table 14 indicates, we find no evidence that adversarial interventions are followed by
negative long-term effects on operating performance. Indeed, in each of the four regressions,
each of the coefficients for the dummy variables representing the years (t+1), (t+2), (t+3), (t+4),
and (t+5) is higher than the coefficient for the event year.

This Table follows the same specification as Table 4 except that the “target firms” include only targets
that belong to the “adversarial” subsample of all targets. An event is classified as an “adversarial
intervention” if the activist adopts tactics that are openly confrontational, including threats or actual proxy
contests, lawsuits, and hostile takeovers, as well as shareholder proposals and public campaigns that
involve confrontation (e.g., campaigns to oust CEOs). As in Table 4, all standard errors adjust for

Furthermore, in the F-tests we conduct for the two Q regressions, each of the (t+3), (t+4),
and (t+5) coefficients is higher than either the coefficient for year t or the coefficient for year (t–
1), and the positive differences, which increase from year three to five, are statistically significant in all twelve F-tests at the 1% significance level. As to the F-tests for the ROA regressions,
the corresponding differences are positive in eleven out of twelve F-tests (and zero in the
remaining F-test) and the positive differences are statistically significant in five out of these
eleven F-tests.
Finally, we examine whether improvements in operating performance that targets of
adversarial interventions enjoy during the years following the intervention tend to be smaller
than those experienced by other targets of activist interventions. To this end, we run regressions
(not tabulated) that follow the specifications of Table 4 adding interaction terms for the dummy
variables of (t), (t+1), (t+2), (t+3), (t+4), and (t+5) with a dummy variable for “adversarial”
64

interventions. We then conduct joint F-tests to examine whether the post-intervention improvements in operating performances are different between the adversarial subsample and the
complement subsample of other targets. We find that the two subsamples are not statistically
different in terms of the magnitude of the post-intervention improvements in operating
performance at the 10% significance level.
We conclude that the alleged adverse effect on long-term performance is not found when one
focuses on adversarial interventions, either. The evidence does not support concerns that
adversarial interventions are followed by long-term declines in performance.
VI. INCREASED VULNERABILITY TO ECONOMIC SHOCKS?
It might be suggested that, even if activist interventions benefit investors on an expectedvalue basis, activist interventions might be troubling to the extent that they increase risks by
making companies more vulnerable (say, by increasing leverage or decreasing cash or other
liquid reserves) in the event of an adverse economic shock. 108 We are not persuaded that this line
of reasoning could justify an opposition to hedge fund activism (and even less so rules that
insulate boards from such activism). We note that most shareholders of public companies hold
diversified portfolios and that our stock-return analysis reaches its conclusions adjusting for risk,
using standard methodologies for doing so. In any event, the analysis in this Part examines
empirically whether activist interventions during the years preceding the financial crisis made
targeted firms more vulnerable to the downturn when the crisis came. We find no evidence that
this is the case.
The financial crisis provides a good setting for testing impact on the vulnerability of
companies both because the negative shock was of considerable magnitude and the shock was
exogenous to any individual firm (i.e., not caused by the actions of any given firm). We divide
our analysis of the crisis period into two parts. Part VI.A examines whether targeted firms
suffered more severe declines in operating performance during the financial crisis than firms not
targeted by activism. Part VI.B compares these two groups of firms in terms of the likelihood of
financial distress or delisting during the crisis.
108.

This argument was raised, for example, by corporate lawyers participating in a Harvard Law
School event in which our findings were discussed.

65

A. Operating Performance During the Crisis
We conduct our analysis in this section on all public firms that were reported in Compustat
in 2006–2007. The dependent variables are changes in ROA and Q from before to after the crisis.
The levels before the crisis are averaged over the two years 2006–2007 for each firm; and the
post-crisis levels are averaged over the two years 2008–2009. The dependent variables ∆ROA
and ΔQ are the differences between after and before the crisis.

The key independent variable “Targeted During 2004–2007” is a dummy variable equal to

one if the firm was targeted by any activist hedge fund during the period of 2004–2007. About
8.58% of the firms in existence at the end of 2007 fall into this category.
Control variables include the logarithm of individual firms’ market cap and age averaged
over the two years 2006–2007. We use different specifications that include or exclude industryfixed effects. Note that firm-fixed effects are not feasible because the data are constructed as one
cross section.
Table 15 below reports the results of our regressions. Regressions (1) and (2) focus on
changes in Q, and regressions (3) and (4) focus on changes in ROA. Regressions (1) and (3) do
not use industry-fixed effects, and regressions (2) and (4) use such fixed effects.
The results of Table 15 provide no support for the concern that firms targeted by activism
fared worse—that is, experienced a more significant decline in performance—during the
financial crisis. The coefficient of the variable “Targeted During 2004–2007” is positive in all
four regressions, and it is significant at the 5% significance level in one of the Q regressions and
one of the ROA regressions. Thus, the evidence does not support the view that activism during
the years preceding the financial crisis made the targeted firms more fragile and vulnerable to
downturns and economic shocks and that those firms were thus hurt more by the crisis.

B. Financial Distress and Delisting During the Crisis
The analysis of Part VI.A does not incorporate firms that disappeared from the Compustat
database during the financial crisis due to financial distress. Thus, the question arises whether
targeted firms had higher odds of financial distress during the crisis than firms that were not
targeted. Before proceeding, we note that summary statistics for the full universe of activist
interventions do not reveal higher odds of financial distress than for nontargeted public
companies; the five-year cumulative probability of distress-related delisting (bankruptcy,
insolvency, and liquidation) is the same among targets of activist interventions as in the universe

67

of public companies in general (both are about 5%). In this section, however, we focus on the
narrower set of financial-distress cases occurring during the financial crisis. 109
To examine this question, we use a logit model to assess how the propensity of delisting due
to insolvency, defined as bankruptcy or delisting due to insolvency, is related to the status of
being targeted during 2004–2007. In our sample as a whole, the incidence of delisting during
2008–2009 due to bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation is 2.48%. As before, we use standard
controls for market capitalization and firm age as controls, and we use both specifications that
include and do not include industry-fixed effects. In the regression with fixed effects, we use the
conditional logit model that accommodates fixed effects.
Table 16 below reports the results of our logit regressions. Regression (1) includes industryfixed effects, while in regression (2) we do not use such fixed effects.

109.

Although we examine this issue for completeness of analysis, we would like to note that, in our
view, a finding of increased vulnerability in some states of the world would not justify opposition to
hedge fund activism. As we noted earlier, most shareholders of public companies hold diversified
portfolios and what matters for them is the impact of activism on an expected-value, risk-adjusted basis.

68

and “ln(Firm Age 2006–2007)” defined as the logarithm of the number of years since a firm’s first
appearance in the merged CRSP/Compustat database. Column (1) adopts the conditional logit regression
with industry-fixed effects, and column (2) adopts the logit model without industry-fixed effects. All
standard errors adjust for clustering at the firm level. Finally, *, **, and *** indicate statistical
significance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance level, respectively.

VII. POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Our findings have implications for a significant number of ongoing policy debates. As
stressed in the Introduction, the myopic-activists claim has been a key argument for opposing
reforms that would strengthen the rights, power, and involvement of activist shareholders and for
supporting changes that would limit such rights, power, and involvement. Below we illustrate the
substantial policy stakes by discussing a number of significant corporate-law debates.
A. Balance of Power Between Shareholders and Boards
We begin with the implications of the myopic-activists claim for the desirable balance of
power between shareholders and boards in public companies. This claim has been used to argue
against any shifts in this balance in favor of shareholders. For example, when Senator Charles
Schumer suggested federal legislation that would have substantially expanded shareholder rights
69

in a number of ways (the Shareholder Bill of Rights Act of 2009), 110 opponents invoked the
myopic-activists claim. They argued that the increase in shareholder rights “would fuel the very
stockholder-generated short-termist pressure that, in the view of many observers, contributed
significantly to the financial and economic crises we face today.” 111
Such arguments have succeeded in influencing how prominent Delaware judges view the
optimal balance of power between shareholders and directors. In an essay on the virtues of
“patient capital,” then-Justice Jacobs expresses his concern about “legal developments that
empower shareholders to force corporate boards and managements to be more responsive to their
immediate agendas,” 112 and he opines that the combination of increased shareholder power with
shareholder willingness to use it has created a serious national problem. 113 Similarly, in an essay
on the fundamentals of corporate governance, then–Vice Chancellor Strine expressed concern
about the increasing empowerment of shareholders. 114 He states that “undifferentiated
empowerment of these so-called stockholders may disproportionately strengthen the hand of
activist institutions that have short-term or non-financial objectives that are at odds with the
interests of individual index fund investors.” 115

110. E.g., Press Release, Senator Chuck Schumer, Schumer, Cantwell Announce ‘Shareholder Bill of
Rights’ to Impose Greater Accountability on Corporate America (May 19, 2009), available at
http://votesmart.org/public-statement/427143/schumer-cantwell-announce-shareholder-bill-of-rights-toimpose-greater-accountability-on-corporate-america (on file with the Columbia Law Review) (describing
proposed legislation’s objectives and major components). Senator Schumer’s proposed bill intended to
implement, by federal mandate, a series of measures to strengthen shareholder rights, including
facilitating stockholders’ proxy access, ending staggered boards at all companies, and requiring that all
directors receive a majority of votes cast to be elected. Shareholder Bill of Rights Act of 2009, S. 1074,
111th Cong. (2009) (proposing changes to Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

it empowers intermediaries”).

Thus, our findings cast doubt on the validity of claims raised in support of an allocation of
power that favors directors over shareholders. These findings should therefore inform the
ongoing debate on the subject.
B. Staggered Boards
The extent to which directors are accountable to and influenced by shareholders depends on
whether the board is staggered. When the board is staggered, directors are elected to three-year
terms, and two-thirds of the directors do not come up for reelection in any year. By contrast, in
companies with boards that are not staggered, all directors come up for reelection each year.
Thus, having a staggered board provides a significant impediment to hedge fund activism and,
conversely, having annual elections for all directors facilitates the influence of such investors. 116
Annual elections for all directors are widely viewed as a best governance practice by
shareholders and their advisers, and shareholder proposals calling for board declassification have
been receiving massive support from shareholders. 117 Supporters of staggered boards, however,
have been using the myopic-activists claim to defend staggered boards. In 2012, Wachtell Lipton
issued strongly worded memoranda criticizing the submission of board-declassification
proposals and the resulting large-scale dismantling of staggered boards. 118 It argued that the

dismantling of staggered boards “would exacerbate the short-term pressures under which
American companies are forced to operate.” 119
Thus, our findings call into question key claims that have been raised to defend board
classification and to insulate directors from shareholders. These findings should inform the
ongoing debate on staggered boards and annual elections for all directors.
C. Reforms of Corporate Elections
The myopic-activists claim also has implications for the rules governing elections. These
rules determine the extent to which it is difficult for shareholders to replace directors, and they
influence the extent to which boards are attentive to the preferences of shareholders in general
and activist investors in particular. Opponents of reforms that strengthen shareholder power to
replace directors have argued that such a reform “perversely incentivizes directors to generate
immediate returns at the cost of future growth, at the expense of the corporation and its
shareholders (and the economy as a whole).” 120
To illustrate the use of the myopic-activists claim in opposing any invigoration of the
shareholder franchise, consider the debate over providing shareholders with “proxy access”—
that is, the power to place some director candidates on the corporate ballot. 121 Not surprisingly,
companies, corporate advisers, and management groups have invoked the myopic-activists claim
to oppose proxy access altogether or to argue for substantial restrictions of its use. 122

72

Thus, our findings that the myopic-activists claim is not supported by the data call into
question key claims that have been raised to strengthening the shareholder franchise. These
findings should inform the ongoing debate on the shareholder franchise and the reform of
corporate elections.
D. Limiting Rights of Shareholders with Short Holding Periods
A standard feature of corporate arrangements and rules is that they provide shareholders with
the same rights per share regardless of when the shareholders came to own their shares; when A
buys B’s shares, A usually steps into B’s shoes and obtains the same rights that B had. Opponents
of activism, however, have been attracted to arrangements that weaken the powers and rights of
shareholders who have held their shares for shorter periods. Because such arrangements could be
designed to decrease the voting power of activists and to provide a disproportionately large
voting power to insiders, they can further insulate directors from allegedly myopic activists.
The increase in investor activism in recent years has led to increased interest in and calls for
such arrangements. In recent years, Justin Fox and Jay Lorsch suggested adopting “a sliding
scale on which voting power increases with length of ownership” or “restrict[ing] voting in corporate elections of any kind to those who have owned their shares for at least [one] year”; 123
then-Chancellor Strine expressed support for the principle that “[s]tockholders who [p]ropose
[l]ong-[l]asting [c]orporate [g]overnance [c]hanges [s]hould [h]ave a [s]ubstantial, [l]ong-[t]erm
[i]nterest that [g]ives [t]hem a [m]otive to [w]ant the [c]orporation to [p]rosper”; 124 the SEC

limited the use of the proxy-access rule it adopted (later invalidated on procedural grounds by the
D.C. Circuit 125) to shareholders with a substantial holding period of at least three years, 126
responding to many comments filed with the SEC in support of such a requirement; 127 and the
Generation Foundation, an arm of Generation Investment Management, commissioned
consulting company Mercer to study the possibility of encouraging shareholders to hold shares
for long periods (and thereby have a long-term focus) through “loyalty rewards” of extra
dividends, warrants, and additional voting rights. 128
Our findings thus call into question arguments made in support of limiting the rights of
short-term shareholders. Concerns that hedge fund activism has a negative effect on long-term
shareholder value and corporate performance are not supported by the data.
E. Disclosure of Stock Accumulations by Activist Investors
The myopic-activists claim also has clear implications for the ongoing debate on the
disclosure requirements governing predisclosure stock accumulations by activist hedge funds.
Seeking to discourage such activism, opponents have been urging the SEC to tighten the existing
disclosure requirements. 129 And the SEC has announced that it will reexamine these existing
disclosure requirements.

In prior work by the three of us with Robert Jackson, we have pointed out that any such
examination should take into account the reduction in activist engagements that can be expected
to result from such tightening. 130 Whether such a reduction would be detrimental or beneficial
depends, in turn, on the validity of the myopic-activists claim. Opponents of activism have
claimed that negative long-term consequences justify tightening of disclosure requirements. 131
Thus, our findings that hedge fund activism is associated with beneficial long-term
consequences do not support policy arguments made in support of a tightening of disclosure
rules that would discourage and reduce the incidence of such activism. These findings should
inform any SEC examination of the subject.
F.

Boards’ Dealings with Activists

Finally, the myopic-activists claim has implications for how boards should engage with
activist investors. To the extent that the actions sought by hedge fund activists tend to be
detrimental to long-term value, boards’ engaging with the activist in an adversarial fashion, and
approaching the activist’s proposals with substantial skepticism, could be beneficial. Conversely,
to the extent that activist interventions are associated with long-term benefits to companies and
their shareholders, such an adversarial and defensive attitude could be counterproductive.
Invoking the myopic-activists claim, influential corporate advisors have indeed advised
boards facing an activist intervention to view it as an activist “attack.” 132 Boards have thus been
encouraged to work to “forestall an attack” and be prepared to “defend vigorously.” 133
130.

Disclosure, 2 Harv. Bus. L. Rev. 39, 47–51 (2012) (explaining tightening rules can be expected to reduce
incidence of activist engagements); see also Bebchuk et al., Pre-Disclosure Accumulations, supra note 42,
at 17–19 (analyzing how tightening disclosure requirements can be expected to discourage hedge fund
activism).

concerns justify such tightening).

“attack” and variations on it about twenty times. See Martin Lipton & Sabastian V. Niles, Wachtell,

Our findings should inform the ongoing debate on how corporate directors should engage
with activists. These findings call into question suggestions that corporate boards facing an
activist should “circle the wagons” and that the board keep in mind that it has “no duty to
discuss” with the activist and “no duty to respond.” 134 Our findings indicate that constructively
engaging with the activist, rather than defending vigorously against it, could well serve longterm shareholder value and corporate performance.
CONCLUSION
This Paper has examined empirically the claim that interventions by activist hedge funds
have an adverse effect on the long-term interests of companies and their shareholders. Although
this testable claim has been influential and regularly invoked, its supporters have thus far failed
to back it up with empirical evidence. This Paper provides a comprehensive investigation of this
claim and finds that it is not supported by the data.
We study the universe of about 2,000 interventions by activist hedge funds during the period
1994–2007, examining a long time window of five years following the intervention. We find no
evidence that interventions, including the investment-limiting and adversarial interventions that
are especially resisted by opponents, are followed in the long term by declines in operating
performance. Indeed, we find evidence that such interventions are followed by long-term
improvements, rather than declines, in performance.
We also find no evidence that the initial positive stock-price spike accompanying activist
interventions fails to appreciate their long-term costs and therefore tends to be followed by
negative abnormal returns in the long term; the data are consistent with the initial spike reflecting

preceding the financial crisis rendered companies more vulnerable and that the targeted
companies therefore were more adversely affected by the crisis.
Our findings that the considered claims and concerns are not supported by the data have
significant implications for ongoing policy debates. Among other things, these findings
undermine a key claim that has been invoked in support of (i) weakening shareholders’ powers
vis-à-vis directors, (ii) using board classification to insulate directors from shareholders and
impeding shareholders’ ability to replace directors, (iii) opposing any invigoration of the
shareholder franchise, (iv) limiting the rights of shareholders with short holding periods, (v)
tightening the disclosure rules governing stock accumulations by hedge fund activists, and (vi)
boards’ following a “circle the wagons” approach to adversarial interventions. Our findings thus
have implications for each of these ongoing debates.
