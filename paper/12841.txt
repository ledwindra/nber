Uncertainty and the Dynamics of R&D
Nicholas Bloom
NBER Working Paper No. 12841
January 2007
JEL No. D8,D92,E32,O3
ABSTRACT
Uncertainty varies strongly over time, rising by 50% to 100% in recessions and by up to 200% after
major economic and political shocks. This paper shows that higher uncertainty reduces the responsiveness
of R&D to changes in business conditions - a "caution-effect" - making it more persistent over time.
Thus, uncertainty will play a critical role in shaping the dynamics of R&D through the business cycle,
and its response to technology policy. I also show that if firms are increasing their level of R&D then
the effect of uncertainty will be negative, while if firms are reducing R&D then the effect of uncertainty
will be positive.

I. Introduction
Uncertainty about future productivity and demand conditions varies strongly over time, rising
by 50% to 100% during recessions, and by 100% to 200% after major political and economic
shocks.1 These ‡uctuations in uncertainty appear to generate ‡uctuations in investment, hiring and productivity as higher uncertainty generates a temporary slowdown and bounceback
as …rms postpone activity and wait for uncertainty to resolve (Bloom, 2006).
An omitted factor from this analysis, however, is R&D which has become a focus of recent
business cycle models (Diego Comin and Mark Gertler, 2006, and Gadi Barlevy, 2007). R&D
may respond di¤erently to uncertainty because of di¤erent adjustment costs. Investment in
the capital stock typically incurs stock adjustment costs from changing the capital stock,
while R&D investment in the knowledge stock typically incurs ‡ow adjustment costs from
changing the ‡ow rate of the knowledge stock (see section II). I show that these di¤erent
adjustment costs lead to di¤erent predicted dynamics under uncertainty, including making
R&D rates much less responsive to business-conditions and more persistent over time at
higher uncertainty.
These adjustment-cost and uncertainty e¤ects can help to explain the high persistence
of R&D across time, which at the …rm-level is about three times more autocorrelated than
investment. They may also help to explain why across-business cycles R&D is highly persistent and responds to recessions with a lag. The higher uncertainty in downturns will reduce
the responsiveness of R&D, delaying its response to worsening business conditions. Finally
1

William Schwert (1989) shows that uncertainty over future industrial production, stock and bond prices
‡uctuate over the business cycle, increasing by 50% to 100% in recessions. Nick Bloom (2006) shows stockmarket volatility jumps 100% to 200% after economic and political shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the
assassination of JFK and the 9/11 attack.

the results imply …rms will be much less responsive to technology policies during periods of
high uncertainty, for example if the policy change itself increases uncertainty.

II. Time varying uncertainty with stock and ‡ow adjustment costs
The traditional real options models assumed time constant uncertainty in order to derive
analytical solutions.2 They assumed some driving process, for example price (P ), evolved as
a Geometric Brownian motion with a constant drift

(II.1)

dPt = Pt ( + dWt )

and constant volatility

where dWt

N (0; 1)

Since volatility is …xed, investigating the impact of time-varying ‡uctuations in uncertainty
is not possible in these models.
A small literature has tried to extend these models to incorporate time varying uncertainty
( t ). It …nds temporary increases in uncertainty cause a drop and rebound in investment,
employment and productivity growth due to a “delay-e¤ect”, which can be summarized as
dIt =d

t

< 0. At high levels of uncertainty …rms postpone making decisions so aggregate

investment and employment activity slows down. Productivity growth also slows down as
reallocation of factors of production from low to high productivity …rms slows.3 Higher uncertainty also induces a “caution e¤ect”whereby …rms are less responsive to any given shock
because higher uncertainty increases the chances of making a costly mistake, so responsiveness is lower (Bloom et al., 2007), which can be summarized as @ 2 It =@ t @Pt < 0.

See Ben Bernanke (1983) and John Hassler (1996) for a single agent and factor model, and Bloom 2006
for a micro to macro multi-factor model and empirical evidence.

These extensions, however, have yet to examine the impact of time varying uncertainty on
R&D and the knowledge stock. In the productivity and innovation literature the knowledge
stock (Gt ) is usually modelled as the accumulation of R&D expenditures (Rt ) over time,
in a similar way that capital stocks (Kt ) are modelled as the accumulation of investment
expenditures (It ) over time:
(II.2)

Kt+1 = (1

K )Kt

+ It

(II.3)

Gt+1 = (1

G )Gt

+ Rt

Although uncertainty and real-options are not modelled, one could speculate that R&D will
be a¤ected in the same way by uncertainty as investment.4 But, this turns out not to be
true due to the di¤erent adjustment costs for capital and knowledge stocks.
Capital stock adjustment costs are typically assumed to arise from direct changes to their
stocks, for example from resale losses for capital goods. This can be written as
(II.4)

CK (It )

CK ( Kt )

Knowledge stocks, however, are intangible and can not typically be bought or sold.5 Instead,
knowledge stocks are adjusted (more slowly) by changing the level of R&D, which changes the
growth rate of the knowledge stock. The adjustment costs for R&D - for example resale losses
on R&D equipment or scientists hiring/…ring costs - are similar, however, to the adjustment
costs for capital in that they depend on the change in R&D levels. Given the law of motion
4

There is a literature looking at “R&D real-options”, which uses stochastic calculus to value complex
multi-stage R&D projects, but these assume no R&D adjustment costs and no change in uncertainty over
time, so are focused on R&D project valuation rather than dynamics (see for example, Eduardo Schwartz,
2003).
5

Patents are one exception to this, although these cover a small fraction of R&D as they are only available
on innovative codi…ed knowledge, typically with a few years lag due to delays in the patenting process.

for the knowledge stock (II.3) this implies
(II.5)

CG ( Rt ) = CG (

Gt

CG (

G

Gt )

Gt )

Comparing (II.4) to (II.5) the adjustment costs for the knowledge stock are one order of
di¤erence apart from the adjustment cost for the capital stock. This distinction arises because
the costs of adjustment for capital arises directly from changing its stock. The costs of
changing knowledge stocks arise not from changing its stock, but from changing the rate of
change of its stock (R&D). Thus, adjustment costs arise in changing the level of the capital
stock and changing the ‡ow rate of the knowledge stock. This distinction plays a critical
role in shaping the response of investment and R&D to uncertainty.
Interestingly, in the macro literature a number of recent papers (for example Lawrence
Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum and Charles Evans (2005)) assume a ‡ow cost for changing
investment rates between periods, CK ( It ): Under these assumption my results for R&D
would extend to capital. This would also be true more generally of the impact of uncertainty
if it a¤ected industries producing productive assets, such as the capital goods producing
industry (see, for example, Sherwin Rosen and Robert Topel, 1988).

There are adjustment costs for changing R&D. In the baseline model these are assumed
to be linear, re‡ecting the hiring/…ring costs for scientists and buying/selling costs for R&D
equipment, C( Rt ) = j Rt j, where

> 0. I also present results for quadratic adjustment

costs for comparison, C( Rt ) =

(Rt =Gt ))2 , where

Q Gt (

Q

> 0. In the model I assume the

adjustment costs for capital and labor are zero for analytical tractability, and focus on the
implications of R&D adjustment costs. This should not change the stylized results for R&D,
because in a Cobb-Douglas production function with iso-elastic demand each factor responds
most to its own adjustment costs, with limited cross-factor response.6 Analytical results can
show a unique solution to the …rm’s optimization problem exists (see the Appendix for the
full model), with numerical methods used to solve for exact values.7
Figure 1 plots the optimal rates of R&D as a function of current business conditions for
low uncertainty (

t

= 5%), medium uncertainty (

t

= 20%) and high uncertainty (

t

= 50%).

There are two key results from the simulation.
First, the adjustment costs for changing R&D generate a zone of inaction in the response
of R&D to changes in business (demand and productivity) conditions. Given the costs of
changing R&D rates …rms only incur this when the gap between the actual and desired R&D
rate is above a certain threshold, generating a central region of inaction. This creates a
dynamic link between current and past R&D rates, consistent with the empirical evidence
6

that R&D rates change only slowly over time, and are more persistent then sales growth,
employment growth or investment rates.8
Second, the zone of inaction is larger for higher values of uncertainty, and the response is
more muted when it does occur. This is the “caution e¤ect”of uncertainty on R&D behavior.
When uncertainty is high the probability of business conditions changing are greater, and
since it is costly to change R&D rates the option value of waiting is greater.
Figures 2a and 2b plot the optimal rates of R&D expenditures at low, medium and high
uncertainty for low prior values of R&D and high prior values of R&D.9 The key result is that
the direct impact of uncertainty depends on the di¤erence between optimal R&D and lagged
R&D. If optimal R&D is higher than lagged R&D (the right side of both …gures) - so that
…rms want to raise R&D - then higher uncertainty reduces R&D, a negative “delay-e¤ect”.
If optimal R&D is below lagged R&D (the left side of both …gures) - so the …rms want to cut
R&D - then higher uncertainty increases R&D, a positive “delay-e¤ect”. Thus, the impact
of the “delay e¤ect”depends on the relationship between desired R&D and lagged R&D.
Of course, if R&D depreciates over time (due to scientists quitting and equipment wearing
out), then temporary increases in uncertainty will reduce R&D at the steady state. This is
because the inherited level of R&D will have depreciated below the optimal level. This is
very similar to the reasoning behind the negative steady state “delay e¤ect”of uncertainty on
investment and hiring which arises because depreciation, attrition and growth mean inherited
capital and labor are always below their optimal levels.
8

For example, in Compustat data (1990 to 1999, manufacturing) the correlation between current and
two-year lagged sales growth rates are 0.082, labor growth rates are 0.095, investment rates are 0.274, and
R&D rates are 0.690. The aggregate …gures show a similar pattern (Comin and Gertler (2006)).
9

These values are 1.875% and 7.5%, chosen as half and twice the steady-state rate of R&D expenditure,
Rt
, given the 15% depreciation in Gt and quarterly periodicity.
rt = G
t

Figure 3 plots the optimal rates of R&D expenditure for low, medium and high uncertainty assuming only quadratic adjustment costs for R&D. The e¤ects of uncertainty almost
completely disappear. With quadratic adjustment costs no real options e¤ects arise, and
the assumed homogeneity on revenue function in demand conditions and knowledge stocks
minimizes any Jensen’s e¤ects from a concave/convex marginal revenue product of R&D in
demand conditions. Hence, the impact of uncertainty on R&D depends critically on the
adjustment costs for R&D, for which empirical evidence is very limited.

IV. Implications of uncertainty for micro and macro R&D
At the micro level the “caution-e¤ect” of uncertainty on R&D implies much lower responsiveness of …rms in periods of high uncertainty. This could explain why, for example, US
…rms have been so slow to respond to the R&D tax credit, a policy beset by continued uncertainty over its survival (Bloom et al., 2002). This could be investigated by estimating (with
appropriate instrumentation) the following type of regression10

where ri;t is …rm i year t (R&D/sales), yi;t is …rm i year t log(sales) and Xi;t are a full set
of controls including …xed e¤ects and year dummies. The empirical implication from section
(III) for R&D is that higher uncertainty should reduce the responsiveness of …rms to sales
growth (

5

< 0) and increase the responsiveness to lagged R&D expenditure (

4

> 0).

At the macro level the “delay-e¤ect” of uncertainty on R&D is highlighted in table 1,
10

Micro data is particularly suitable for testing the “caution e¤ect” of because of the large samples of
impulses and responses in …rm panel data. Macro data is particularly suitable for testing the “delay-e¤ect”
because of the role of re-allocation across …rms in driving the productivity component of the “delay-e¤ect”
which only arises under aggregation.

with uncertainty e¤ects on investment in table 2 for comparison. The two columns in Table
1 re‡ect the result that higher uncertainty increases R&D if the current period R&D is a
downward adjustment (Rt < Rt 1 ), and reduces R&D if the current period R&D is an upward
adjustment (Rt > Rt 1 ).

* If R&D rates depreciate at rate

then the condition is Rt < (1

In contrast table 2 shows that lagged investment plays no role in determining current
investment. Instead comparing across the two rows shows that uncertainty increases current
investment if the capital stock is decreasing after controlling for depreciation (Kt < (1
K )Kt 1 ),

and reduces it if capital stock is increasing (Kt > Kt 1 ).

Thus, this implies uncertainty would reduce R&D when it is increasing - typically during

the recovery from a recession and initial part of a boom. In comparison it would reduce
investment when capital is above trend - typically during a boom. In addition higher uncertainty will tend to increase the persistence of R&D changing its dynamics, but reduce the
responsiveness of investment changing its amplitude. Thus, uncertainty will have a di¤erential impact on the levels and dynamics of R&D versus investment, due to di¤erent ‡ow
versus stock adjustment costs.

V. Conclusions
Uncertainty varies strongly over time, persistently rising by 50% to 100% during recessions,
and temporarily rising by 100% to 200% after major political and economic shocks. The
impact of these changes in uncertainty on investment and hiring appears to be two-fold: …rst
higher uncertainty typically reduces aggregate investment, hiring and productivity growth
due to a “delay e¤ect”, and second higher uncertainty makes …rms less responsive to any
changes in their environment, a “caution e¤ect”. These e¤ects have been shown to be analytically and empirically important in micro and macro investment and employment behavior.
This paper extends these results on time varying uncertainty to R&D by modelling the
‡ow adjustment costs of knowledge stocks and contrasting this to the stock adjustment costs
of capital and labor. I show that higher uncertainty reduces the responsiveness of R&D to
changes in demand conditions and increases the persistence of R&D over-time, the R&D
equivalent to the “caution-e¤ect”. I also show that if …rms are increasing R&D then the
marginal e¤ect of uncertainty on R&D will be negative, while if …rms are reducing R&D
then the marginal e¤ect of uncertainty on R&D will be positive. Thus, the R&D equivalent

to the “delay-e¤ect”depends on the desired change in R&D. I then present micro and macro
predictions, with the hope that future empirical research will make progress in testing these.

In the model for analytical tractability I assume the adjustment costs for capital and labor
are zero and focus on the implications of R&D adjustment costs. This should not change
the stylized results for R&D, but facilitates a numerical solution to the model since the state
and control spaces are both reduced by two dimensions.
There are no structural estimates of R&D adjustment costs in the literature. But there
is a long literature on capital and labor adjustment costs which I use as a starting point
for modelling R&D adjustment costs(Bloom (2006), and Russell Cooper and John Haltiwanger (2006)). This literature focuses on three cost terms - linear costs re‡ecting per
unit adjustment costs: C( Rt ) =

Rt

(

Rt > 0]

[ Rt < 0]), quadratic ad-

justment costs re‡ecting higher costs of rapid changes: C( Rt ) =

costs re‡ecting the revenue loss from disruption involved in changing factors of production:

F

adjustment costs, but also investigated a range of other adjustment costs and found real
options e¤ects whenever linear or …xed costs were present.
With fully ‡exible capital and labor I can optimize these out, and then normalize the
business conditions process, to derive the concentrated revenue function Fe(Y; G) = AY 1 G .
The Bellman equation can then be stated as follows
V (Yt ; Gt ; Rt 1 ;

t)

= max Fe(Yt ; Gt )

E[V (Yt+1 ; Gt+1 ; Rt ;

where w is the cost of R&D and r is the discount rate. The problem is jointly homogeneous
of degree one in (Yt ; Gt ; Rt ; Rt 1 ) so can be normalized by Gt
V (yt ; 1; rt 1 ;

t)

= max Fe(yt ; 1)

…rm’s optimization problem exists, with numerical methods used to solve for exact values.
