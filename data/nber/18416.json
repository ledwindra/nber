    "abstract": "\n\nAgricultural development may support broader economic development, though agricultural expansion may also crowd-out local non-agricultural activity.  On the United States Plains, areas over the Ogallala aquifer experienced windfall agricultural gains when post-WWII technologies increased farmers' access to groundwater.  Comparing counties over the Ogallala with nearby similar counties, local non-agricultural sectors experienced only short-run benefits.  Despite substantial persistent agricultural gains, there was no long-run expansion of local non-agricultural sectors and there are some indications of crowd-out.  With the benefit of long-run historical perspective, supporting local agricultural production does not appear to generate local economic spillovers that might justify its distortionary impacts.\n\n",
