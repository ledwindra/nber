     The abolition of the favorable tax treatment of long term capital gaina

forced inveatora    to reasaeaa    traditional year-end trading atrategiea   uaed

to manage tax liabilities.        Thia study comparea with year-end trading

behavior in previoua years with that observed at the end of 1986.         Trad-


itional strategies involve selling both short and long term losers and

                                            Our results affirm previous findings
holding short and long term winners.
                                                              for 1986, we find
concerning tax induced trading at year end.        However,

that the anticipated tax code changes had a powerful effect on trading

behavior.   Compared to previous years, relative trading volume was con-

siderably higher in Oecember of 1986 for long term winners and lower for

long term losers.     Additional results indicate that traditional patterns

of trading induced by short term capital gains and losses were also

altered substantially in 1986.

               Tax Induced Trading: The Effect of the
            1986 Tax ReforR Act on Stock Market Activity




       The most sweeping revision of the United States tax code in

many years became law in September, 1986.      One key aspect of

that law was the elimination of the favorable tax treatment of

long term capital gains.    Under prior law, capital gains on as-

sets held at least six months were generally- taxed at only 40

percent of the rate applied to ordinary income.      Under the new

tax law, assets sold after December 31, 1986 are to be taxed,

with   a few exceptions2, at the same rate at which ordinary in-

come is taxed.     This change represented the largest capital

gains tax rate increase in at least half a century.
       The purpose of this study   is to assess the short run in-

vestor reaction to this change in the tax treatment of capital

gains.    The nearly 4-month lag between the passage of the legis-
lation and the effective date of the tax rate change gave in-

vestors ample opportunity to assess the law's consequences for

their portfolios and adjust their behavior accordingly.      Since

investors are seeking to maximize the risk-adjusted after-tax

return on their portfolio, this record increase in capital gains

tax rates is likely to induce signficant changes in investment

strategy.
       This paper differs from earlier work on this subject in

three important respects.    First, earlier studies focussed on

investor behavior during periods of relatively stable capital

gains tax rates.    In contrast, this paper looks at the effects
                                   2

 of a sharp discontinuity in the capital gains tax rate.     Second,

because of the stability of the capital gains tax rate, these

earlier studies focussed on   a   recurring distortion of normal in-
vestor behavior induced by a combination of the tax rate and the

end of the tax year.    This paper examines two effects: one

recurring, which we deem the "permanent" effect, and one which
is unique to investor behavior in late 1986, which we deem the

"transitory" effect.    Finally, earlier studies made no distinc-
tion between stocks which had appreciated relatively recently
and stocks which had appreciated over a long period of time.

Given the period studied, no distinction was necessary.      How-

ever, the tax changes in 1986 had a different effect on stocks
whose appreciation (or depreciation) had been recent than on
those stocks whose price change was primarily a long term

phenomenon.    We therefore introduce this added dimension   to the

analysis.   With these three exceptions,   this paper follows the

analytic methodology developed by other authors.
     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.     Sec-
tion II provides a summary of previous work concerning tax ef-

fects and security trading.    A model   of taxpayer behavior in-

corporating the change in capital gains taxation is developed in
Section III.   This section also contains a formal statement of
the hypotheses.   A description   of data and methodology is pro-

vided in Section IV.   Empirical results are shown in Section V.
A brief concluding section   follows.

                            I.   Related Studies



        The sensitivity of capital gains realizations to the capi-
tal gains tax rate by holders of common stock has been frequent-

ly demonstrated.       Feldstein and Yitzhaki      (5]   found the sale and

repurchase of corporae stock is quite sensitive to the tax
rate.     In a later study with Slemrod (4), they reported that

high income taxpayers reduced the ratio of their long term gains
to dividends by 0.497 for every one percentage point increase in

the capital gains tax rate.        Ninarik [9] reestimated this data

using a different functional form and weighted least squares,
and found a significant, though substantially lower degree of

responsiveness. On the other hand, a report by the Department
of Treasury [14] found the overall responsiveness of capital

gains realizations to be nearly as great as that found by Feld-

stein, Slenrod, and Yitzhaki.        The Treasury report also found

that conunon stock was the most elastic with respect to the tax

rate of all of the types of assets considered.

        Unlike the present paper, these studies examined only the

long term responsiveness of taxpayers to tax changes.             Cross

section data was used which, in theory, represents taxpayer be-

havior after adjustment to a given tax regime.             Auten and Clot-

felter    [1]   and Lindsey [8] disaggregated taxpayer response into

permanent and transitory components.        However, both studies

looked at aggregate capital gains realizations and did not

report transitory behavior specifically for common stock.

Similarly, the Department of Treasury study considered
                                       4

transitory behavior for aggregate realizations, but not for com-
mon stock sales.
       Our consideration of short tern investor response         to capi-

tal gains tax changes uses an analytic technique developed to

study the year—end tax loss selling phenomenon.         Since capital

gains are not taxed until the asset is sold, investors have an
incentive to realize capital losses before the end of a tax year
and hold capital gains until the next tax year.         In a regime of

constant capital gains tax rates, the savings from such a

strategy approximately equals the accrued interest for one year
on the resulting tax consequences.         This suggests that,   in any

period of roughly unchanged capital gains taxes, the volume of

trading in stocks that had appreciated in value over the year
(winners)     should recede to an abnormally low level during Decem-

ber as investors postpone realizations.         Conversely, stocks that

experienced declining value (losers) should experience abnormal-

ly high trading volume as year end approaches        and investors seek
to realize those losses in the current year.         Furthermore, the

degree of abnormal volume should depend on the amplitude of

gains and losses.
       Dyl   [3)   used a random sample of 100 common stocks for the

period 1948 to 1970.         A relative volume measure was developed
based on monthly trading in the particular stock to total

monthly trading on the New York Stock Exchange.         An expected
volume for December was computed for each stock based on the

relative volume of that security and actual volume on the NYSE.

Dyl   defined      abnormal volume as the difference between actual
                                     5

trading volume and expected volume.          He measured security per-

formance over an    1].   month period from January through November3

and found abnormally low volume for winners and abnormally high

volume for losers.        The evidence indicated that tax considera-

tions were of great importance.          Investors exhibited an enhanced

tendency to hold securities which had appreciated during bull
markets (when their tax rates were thought to be especially

high)    and a reduced tendency during bear markets (when their tax

rates were thought to be especially low).

        Reinganum [II] considered the relationship between tax loss
selling and firm size.       Instead of focussing on volume, he exam-

ined abnormal price movements during January and found that

small capitalization firms which had declined substantially dur-

ing the final 6 months of the previous year      had abnormally high
returns during the first few      trading days of the new year. This

January "rebound" was considerably smaller for large capitiliza—
tion firms.     Although tax loss selling was strongly indicated as

influencing price behavior during early January, a firm—size ef-
fect also   was confirmed.
        Like Reinganum, Givoly and Ovadia     [6]   focussed on abnormal

return data rather than on abnormal volume.          They found that tax
induced selling existed for all firms, but was greatest for
small firms.    Their data indicated that the recovery from tax

induced selling was a major contributor to the abnormally high

returns enjoyed by small stocks during January.          They conclude
that by selecting stocks which reached their 24 month lows in

December, an investor could achieve an excess return even after
                                     6

recognition of transactions costs.
     Constanides   (2]   argued that the optimal trading strategy

for an investor was to sell any short term loser and reinvest

the proceeds in order to reestablish a short term position in

the stock.4    The reason for this is that both short term losers

and short term winners     face a tax rate roughly twice that on

securities held long term, thus doubling the tax saving from a

stock sale which realizes a short term position.       Such a

                                                        it also
strategy not only increases the return to the investor,
restricts tax trading as an explanation for the abnormally high

returns observed in January. Rational investors can profitably
                                                  other than De-
change their effective tax years to end in months
                                                          Janu-
cember, thus allowing them to arbitrage away any abnormal
ary returns.    In general this point has been neglected in sub-

sequent literature.      However, we expand on Constanides argument

regarding the optimal realization of short term losses by apply-

ing it to the unique situation which existed in 1986.
     Lakonishok and Smidt     (7]   examine the relationship between

abnormal volume and past price movements.        Their volume measure

is the number of shares traded relative to the total number of

shares outstanding for each security, which is coupled with a

similar measure for the total market to estimate a normal trad-
                                                      December ef-
ing volume.    They conclude that there is a distinct
fect which is, at least partly, motivated by tax loss selling.
                                                           hold-
However, they also find that a change in the capital gains

ing period is unlikely to affect turnover.        They do not present

evidence as to whether a change in the capital gains tax rate
                                          7

would have a similar effect.

             Although this evidence implies a significant amount of
tax induced trading by investors, the effect of the              level of

capital gains tax rates on investors is open to question.                   For

example, Stiglitz [13] presents a number of possible tax
oriented strategies          wich might help investors eliminate tax
liability.         But, Poterba [10) shows that the vast majority of

investors do not make use of tax minimizing strategies when it

comes to trading.



                             II. Why 1986 is Different



       The existing work on the effect of capital gains taxes on

investor strategy has focussed on behavior during periods of

relatively constant capital gains tax regimes.              The Tax Reform
Act of      1986 offered the possibility of testing investor

sensitivity to a dramatic change in tax regime.              To understand

this effect,           consider first an investor's decision under the old

tax   law.       The investor's basis, or price at purchase,      is normal-

ized to unity and:


             = accumulated return to date         on the existing asset
       R0
             = expected future return on the existing asset
       R1
             = expected future return on an alternative asset
       R2
             =   old   capital gains tax rate
       C0
             = new capital     gains   tax rate
                                    8

A decision by    an investor to sell an existing asset and buy an

alternative asset requires the condition given by equation           1.




         (1—c0) (l+R0) (1+R1)+c0 < (1+(1—c0)R0) (l+(l—c0)R2)              (1)




     The total after tax return for holding the current asset on
is expressed on the left, and the total after tax return for

switching assets on the right.      The key advantage to holding the

existing asset is that no tax is paid currently.          The entire ac-

cumulated value in the investor's current position is allowed to

grow at rate R1.      When the asset is finally sold, the entire

return, (l+R0) (l+R1)—l, is taxed at rate c0.          (The c0 term on

the left side of equation 1 is to compensate for taxing the
whole value of the asset, including the initial purchase price

of unity, in the rest of the left hand term.)            On the other

hand, selling and switching assets involves a current tax

liability equal to c0R0, which diminishes the value of the
stockholder's position to be invested in the new asset. The

rate of return on the new asset, R2, must therefore exceed the

future rate of return on the existing asset to make a sale

profitable.     This extra return is expressed in equation 2.



                          (l—(c0R0/(l+R0))) R2                            (2)




     As long as the accumulated return       in   the existing   asset,

                                                  The ratio of the
R0, is positive, then R2 must exceed R1.
return   on the new   asset to the return   on    the existing   asset is a
                                      9

function of the capital gains tax liability owed as a share of

the before tax proceeds from the sale of the existing asset.

Thus, the higher the capital gains tax rate, the greater the in-
centive to hold the existing asset.            This effect is permanent,

and actually grows over time with           R0 as long as the existing as-

set     is appreciating.   For expository purposes, we will term this

the permanent lock—in effect.

        In December, 1986, the investment calculus         was complicated

by the forthcoming increase in the capital gains tax rate.                If

the investor held the current asset, he would be subject to cap-
ital gains tax at the higher rate not only on his future return,

but on the return already accumulated in the asset as well.               On

the other hand, sale of the asset would allow taxation of the

existing return at a lower rate.          The new choice faced by the

taxpayer is given by equation        3 in   the same context as that pre-

sented in equation 1.



         (1—c1) (1+R0) (1+R1)+c1 <   (l+(1—c0)R0)   (1+(l—c1)R2)            (3)




        The key difference between the investor's choice in equa-

tion 1 and the choice given by equation           3 is   that the total

return on the existing asset will be taxed at c1 if the asset is

held.     On the other hand, the existing return, R0, is taxed at

the lower rate of CO if the asset is sold now and the proceeds

reinvested.     Note that the permanent lock—in effect still

remains as the investor is left with a smaller portfoliovalue

if he sells and pays the capital gains tax.              However, the ad-
                                         10

vantage of selling before the capital gains tax rises creates a

separate effect which runs in the opposite direction.           This is

clearly indicated by equation 4.


          <                          +    ((c1—c0)/(l—c0)(l+R0)) R0
              (1—(c1R0/(l+R0))) R2


        The first term on the right hand side        of equation 4 shows

the permanent lock-in      effect,   and is almost identical to the

right hand side of equation 2.           The only change is that the

permanent lock—in effect is now calculated at rate c1 instead of

c0.     This tends to increase the incentives to hold existing as-

sets.     The gain on the alternative asset        (R2) must now be larger

than before to induce selling, all else equal, as c1 is greater
than c0.

        However, the temporary effect of a change in tax rates in-
duces a second, transitory effect, into the calculus.            This is

given by the second term in equation 4.           This represents the tax
                                                          the
savings (in terms of expected future return) by realizing

existing gains on the asset at the old law's lower tax rate.
Since c1 > c0, if R0 is positive, indicating that a gain has ac-

cumulated in the asset, then a positive incentive to sell is

created.      This positive incentive to sell helps to lower the
value of R2 needed to make selling more profitable than holding

the existing asset. The actual decision to sell will depend on
the relative values of the permanent lock-in effect and the

transitory incentive to sell before the rate increases.
        As a sidelight, the taxpayer might choose        to sell and then
                                     11

buy back his existing assets.        In this case,   the taxpayer may

expect that his current asset yields as high a return as any
alternative asset, R1 = R2, but may still choose to sell because

his existing return on the asset will be taxed at a substanital—

ly lower tax rate.       Equation 5 illustrates the condition under
which this may be true.



                        R1     (c1—c0)/c1(l—c0)                       (5)




        Thus,   tax motivated trading in December, 1986 should exhib-

it a different pattern than tax motivated selling in earlier

years. In the case of winners, there is an increased incentive
to sell them to realize the existing gain on the asset at the

low 1986 capital gains tax       rate.    However, as equation 4

demonstrates, it is by no means clear that this will produce a
net incentive to sell in December, only a reduced incentive to

hold.     This yields our first hypothesis:



Hypothesis #1; In December, 1986, there will be less abnormally

low volume for     long term   winners   than in other Decembers.   How-

ever,    it is unclear whether the resulting increase in volume

will be sufficient to establish abnormally high volume for long

term    winners.


        Conversely, the tax treatment of stocks which have declined
over a long period of time should exhibit less abnormally high
volume    in December, 1986.     This can be seen by contrasting equa—
                                        12

tions    2   and   4   under the assumption that R0 is negative.         Under

old law (equation 2), there is a clear cut incentive to sell a

loser even if the expected return on the new asset, R2 is less

than that on the existing asset, R1.5

        Under the new tax law, this permanent incentive to sell be-

comes even greater because the tax rate on long term losses un-

der the new        law, c1, is greater than under the       old   law.   It

should be noted that under the old law, the tax rate on long

term losses was 50 percent of the ordinary rate, versus 40 per-

cent on winners.          Thus, the effect on winners and losers need
not be symmetric.          We would also expect that there would be less

effect of the law change on losers than on winners as the change

in tax rates is less.           Offsetting this permanent effect, the

transitory effect from the tax change would cause the taxpayer
to be less likely to sell his losers since, R0 being negative,
                                                        than
they would be worth more next year at a tax rate of c1,
this year at a tax rate of c0.           As in   the case   of winners, it is

not clear whether the permanent          or transitory effects dominate.



Hypothesis #2:            In December, 1986, there will be less          ab-

                                                     in other
normally high volume for long term losers than it is
Decembers.         However, it is uncertain whether the reduction in
volume will be sufficient to establish abnormally low volume for

long term losers.


     The situation for short term capital gains is quite dif-

ferent.      The old tax law only afforded lower capital gains tax

rates to assets held at least six months.     The tax rate on short

term capital gains was generally the same as the tax rate on or—

dinary income.     So, in the case of short term winners, there

used to be two reasons not to sell during December.      The first

was the advantage to holding indicated by the permanent lock-in

effect and the resulting deferral of taxes.      The second reason

was that the short term asset would soon become a long term as-

set, thus halving the effective tax rate.    In the context of

equation 2, the likelihood that a profitable switch sale can be
made is greatly enhanced if the capital gains tax rate, c0, is

halved.

     The converse was true   for short term losers.    Selling a
short term asset produced the greatest tax saving.      Holding the
asset entailed two costs: deferral of the tax benefits from

selling a loser and the possible deferral of the asset until it
became a long term loss with a tax value only half that of a

short term loss.

     Thus, the incentive to sell short term losses and hold
short term winners was even stronger than the case for stocks

held long term.    Analysis of abnormal volume based on short run

price performance would therefore indicate an even stronger tax
effect than would be indicated by longer term considerations.

Short term performance would only reinforce any tax motivations

which investors possessed for stocks with similar longer term

performance.
     The Tax Reform Act of 1986 created ambiguity in this situa-

tion for trading during December, 1986.    Two   offsetting   effects
                                   14

resulted from the tax changes.      First,    the tax rate on short

term capital gains was scheduled to be reduced beginning on Jan-

uary 1, 1987.     This would increase the incentives to hold stocks

which had appreciated and to sell stocks which had declined over

the short term.     Second, the distinction between the short term
and the long term capital gains tax rates was eliminated.            This

would remove one of the motives for holding winners and selling

losers which existed in prior years.

     Although it is uncertain, a priori, which of these effects
is stronger, an analysis of effective        tax rates indicates that
the second effect may dominate the first.         Average marginal tax
rates for 1986 and 1987 were generated using the National Bureau

of Economic Research TAXSIM model.6      Limiting the analysis to
taxpayers who reported receiving dividend income, the average

marginal tax rate on short term gains was 21.0 percent, and fell
to 19.2 percent in 1987.     Thus, the incentive to sell losers and

hold winners in order to take advantage of a change in the short

term capital gains rate is relatively small.         By contrast, the
incentive to hold winners and sell losers before they were con-

verted from short term assets into long term assets was consid-

erably weakened.    The long term capital gains tax rate for these

dividend recipients averaged only 9.4 percent under the old tax

law, but would rise   to   19.2 percent under the new   tax   law.

Thus, the incentive to hold a winner in anticipation of convert-

ing a short term gain into a long term gain was reduced from
11.6 percentage points to 2.8 percentage points.

     On average, therefore, investors saw little increase in one
                                   15

motivation for holding a winner, and a considerable decrease in

another incentive for holding a winner.       We would therefore ex-
                                                       term win-
pect a decrease in the normal pattern of holding short
ners while selling short term losers. Thus, the clear pattern of
                                             term losers should
holding short term winners and selling short
be weakened by these tax rate changes.  This leads us to propose

a third hypothesis.



Hvtothesis #3;   The pattern of holding short term winners, and

selling short term losers at year end prior to 1986 should be

significantly weakened in 1986.




                      III. Methodolocv and Data



    Tests of these hypotheses require measurement of the

return, or gain, on various stocks for both a long term and a
short term holding period, as well as the trading volume for

these stocks during that holding period.       Our objective is to

group stocks into various portfolios by ranking their return,
and then comparing the year end activity of the various port-

folios to see if our hypotheses are supported.

    We established    a short term holding period of S months and

a long   term holding period of   23 months terminating at    the end

of November for each year in the study.7       The short term and

long term returns, STG   and   LTG, for   the stock in firm   j   were:
                                            16

                              =
                       STRj           (Price,t_5/Price,t)
                              =
                       LTRj           (Pricej,t_23/Pricej,t)

where Price,t is the November closing price for firm                   j   in the

year   in question.     This construction closely follows the

measures of capital gains used by Lakonishok and Smidt [7), al—

lows the use of monthly prices, and isolates the effect of De—

cember trading.

       Abnormal volume is assessed for every month under study

using a methodology established by Dyl (3].                   This requires a

three step procedure.         First,       a vector of firm—specific relative

volume measures is established for a period of 48 consecutive

months for each firm:

                                                        t-l
                  RVOL1
                                  =
                                      VOLj,t    /    — t—12
                                                      1
                                                           VOL
                                                     12


Thus, RVOL represents the volume of shares traded during a par-
ticular month relative to the average monthly volume during the

preceding 12 months.  RVOLmt, or the relative trading volume
for the entire market is also established for each month.


                                            1       n
                                           -
                         RVOLm,t
                                           fl
                                                    RVOLj,t
                                                    1=1


       The second step    is the creation of the expected, or

"normal", volume of trading.              This is done by estimating an OLS

model of the   form:
                                         17
                                              A.

                       RVOLj,t
                                 =
                                     a   + bj(RVOLm,t)


     Estimates of aj and bj are derived using 36 months of rela-

tive volume data for the firm and the market. These estimates

are   then used to   est iate relative volume for the            subsequent 12
month period.    The   third step in the procedure, the            measurement
of   abnormal volume is produced by subtraction:


                                                   -
                                                        A
                       AVOLI,t       RVOL1,t           RVOLj,t


An abnormal volume measure of 0.10 indicates that volume is 10

percent above its expected level, while a measure of -0.20 indi-
cates that it is 20 percent below its expected level.
       Once the vector of abnormal volume measures has been

determined for a number of firms, the various capital gains

measures are used to rank and partition the sample.                 This allows

the examination of unusual trading behavior for securities with

different performance records.

       Monthly volume and price data were obtained from the PDE
version of Compustat.      RVOL measures were derived for all firms

listed on the NYSE or the AMEX for the period 1976 through 1986.

Since the previous year's monthly volume data is needed to con—

struct the RVOL series for each firm               for   the current year and

three previous   years of RVOL data are needed to construct ab-
normal volume measures, the final sample includes abnormal

volume for the years 1980 through 1986 for those firms with com-

plete RVOL data for any period of 4 consecutive calendar years.
                                  18

The resulting sample of firms varies from a high of 1578 in 1986

to   a low of 1272 in 1980.   Table I provides additional descrip-

tive data for the sample.

      The central concern of this study     is to determine the

transitory effects of the change in capital gains tax laws that
occurred in 1986.    To facilitate this analysis, abnormal volume

data for December during the years 1980 through 1985, a period

of relatively stable tax law, are pooled.       This provides a large

sample of December trading behavior to which December of 1986
can be compared.


                              IV. Results



A.   Long—Term Performance and Trading Volume


      The relationship between long-term capital gains and ab-

normal trading volume is summarized in Tables II and III.         Mean

abnormal volume data for the pooled data (1980 to 1985) and for

1986 are presented for each long—term capital gain quintile.         To

control for differences in the distribution of capital gains

performance measures (LTR and STh) between the pooled sample and
the 1986 sample1 the LTR (and later, STR) guintile ranges for

the 1986 sample were used to classify the pooled data into 5

groups.   Because the pooled data were matched to 1986 return

levels, the 5 groups contain unequal numbers of firms. For ex—

positional ease they are referred to as quintiles in the ensuing
discussion.   Below each entry   in   Table II, the T-value and the
                                    19

number of firms in the quintile are displayed.         This T-value as-

sesses the hypothesis that the AVOL mean for the quintile is

significantly different from zero.
        First,   consider the pooled data in isolation.    The pattern
of means for the pooled data confirms the conventional, pre—1986

strategy of selling losers, creating positive abnormal trading
volume and holding winners, creating negative abnormal trading

volume.     The means are ordered monotonically in the expected

direction.       This confirms earlier findings of various authors

regarding tax effects and year—end selling decisions.
        The 1986 data, considered in isolation, illustrate a

similar monotonic pattern, albeit with a minor "flattening" in

the series between quintiles 3 and       4.   However, all 1986

quintile means are positive, suggesting that December trading
volume was abnormally high across our entire sample of stocks.

This indicates that the transitory effect to realize capital

gains before the tax rate increased overwhelmed the permanent
lock—in effect.       In the context of equation 4,   the second term
dominated the first term.       The only caveat to this observation

is   the lack    of statistical significance for the   AVOL value in
the very highest quintile.       Thus, in absolute terms, December

1986 represented a significant departure from previous Decent—

bers.     However, the traditional incentive to sell losers and
hold winners     is still evidenced in relative terms (i.e., ab-

normal volume is more positive for losers than for winners).
        The crux of our analysis, and the direct test of our

hypotheses concerning investor behavior and long—term capital
                                     20

gains is summarized in the final two columns in Table II.           Mean

abnormal volume increased in 1986 for each of the 5 long-term

capital gain groups as compared with firms exhibiting similar

performance during the period from 1980—1985.        Furthermore, as

evidenced by the F-values, this increase in mean abnormal trad-

ing volume is significant at the 5% level for quintile 3, and at
the   1% level for firms exhibiting even better performance in

quintiles 4 and     5.

       The pattern of differences provides strong evidence that
investors did indeed sell their long—term winners to lock in a

favorable tax liability at the lower long—term rate rather than

postpone this liability into an epoch of significantly higher
tax   rates.

       The hypothesized incentive to hold long—term losers into
1987 in order to enhance the value of such losses is not evi-

denced by our results, however.       We are not certain why this is

the case.      There is one plausible explanation for this

phenomenon given by the tax rules.        Tax motivated selling   in De-

cember offers the investor two possible advantages.        First,    if

the investor has     a net capital gains position, the capital

losses offset these gains and effectively reduce tax liability

by the long term capital gains tax rate.       This motivation would

produce behavior which supports our hypothesis.       However, a sec-
ond motivation occurs if the investor has       a net capital loss

position in the current year.       Capital losses are only deduct-
ible against other income up to $3000, a comparatively small

figure.    Any   excess   is carried over into subsequent tax years.
                                      21

Thus, many capital losses realized in 1986 might actually pro-
duce tax savings valued at 1987 tax rates.         This would tend to

maintain the tax motivations for selling losers in 1986.        As

this carry forward provision is not symmetric with respect to

winners, there is a clear reason why our "winner" hypothesis
should exhibit the expected pattern while the "loser" hypothesis

does not.

     Quintile medians are reported in Table III.         It is worth

noting that quintile 1 is completly populated by long-term

losers,   while quintiles    3   through 5 are completely populated by

long-term winners.     Quintile 2 contains a mix of winners and
losers with the mean and median LTR values positive for pooled

and 1986 data.     Thus,   quintile medians indicate that investors
were net sellers of losers and net holders of winners for the

pre—1986 period and in 1986 with the exception of quintile 4.
    The trend across medians progresses monotonically for the

pooled data.     This reiterates investors' propensity to sell

losers and to hold winners prior to 1986.        In 1986, the trend is

not monotonic.     If anything, the pattern of abnormal trading

volume medians for 1986 quintiles is relatively flat, ranging

from .0496 for the lowest capital gain quintile to —.0375 for

the highest capital gain quintile.

    Differences in abnormal trading volume quintiles are also

reported in Table III.      In this instance, quintile 1 exhibits a

shift in its median that is in accordance with our expectation

that investors will hold long-term losers more tightly than in

previous years.    The statistical significance of the shifts        in
                                   22

quintile medians is assessed using the Wilcoxon 2-Sample test.8
This nonparametric technique for comparison of two sample

medians provides a test statistic which is normally distributed.

The resulting Z-values are reported in the rightmost column.

This shift appears insignificant for the 40% of firms producing

the poorest capital gains performance during the periods of com-

parison.     However, median abnormal trading volume increased sig-

nificantly for the remaining 60% of the firms in each sample.


B.    Short Term Effects and Trading Volume



        Trading motives concerning the disposition of short—term
gains and losses were also changed by the Tax Reform Act of
1986.     As explained earlier, prior to 1986 the incentives for

taxpayers to hold winners and sell losers were unambiguous,

regardless of whether the assets were held for a long term peri-
od or a short term period.      In the case of short term assets,

two objectives entered the investors'calculus, and the effect of

the tax reform depended upon which effect dominated the in-

vestor's decision.
        In order to examine this hypothesis, we must first control

for the long term motivations created by the tax law.     As a

result, we decompose our data to present short term results
which control for long term portfolio performance.     Tables IV

and   V   contain abnormal trading volume means and medians respec-

tively for firms that have been ranked into quintiles twice,
once by STR and again by LTR.     By combining these quintile rank-
                                     23

ings,    25 cells are formed.     Since the rankings are done indepen-

dently, the sample size will vary from cell to cell.        To

maintain comparability of data, cell ranges for short term and

long term price changes derived from the 1986 sample are used to

classify the pooled data.        This is done to facilitate comparison

of data between the pooled and 1986 samples as finns with com-

parable performance records are exhibited in both matricies and

effectively reduces the pooled sample from 8352 to 7909 observa-
tions.     The reduction of 443 observations represents STR, LTR

pairs that "fall off the edge" of the 1986 cell grid.
        The upper left corner cell of the pooled data section of

Table IV contains information concerning firms that were among
the lowest 20%    of short-term performers and the lowest 20% of

long—term performers.     515 finns met this dubious distinction.

Regardless of holding period,       investors had motives to sell such

securities during this period.       And they did, as evidenced by

the large abnormal trading volume mean of .4617.       This implies

that trading volume for these firms was 46% higher than expected

during December.

        Examining the AVOL means for cells across the uppermost

row, two observations can be made.        First, the number of

qualifying firms dwindles predictably.        Relatively few firms can
claim membership among the top 20% of performers over the last

23 months and the bottom 20% of performers over the last 5

months!    Second, the mean AVOL decreases monotonically as we
move from left to right.        Even among the poorest short—term per-

formers, investors are more likely to hold securities which have
                                  24

provided    superior long-term gains.   Although not strictly

monotonic, this trend is apparant for each row in the matrix.

Hence, within any group of stocks exhibiting similar short-term

gains,   the propensity to hold (sell) increases as long—term per-

formance improves (deteriorates).

        Parallel observations can be made by examining cell entries

within a given column.     If we restrict our attention to the

worst 20% of long term performers (LTR quintile 1), as short-

term performance improves, mean AVOL decreases.     However, this

phenomenon is not repeated for other LTR quintiles.     The STR

marginals display a clear pattern suggesting that investors are
more likely to hold short—term winners and sell short—term
losers irregardless of long—term performance. This reinforces
our    earlier observation that under the old tax law, short term
and long term both should exhibit a pattern of holding winners

and selling    losers.

       The AVOL means for the 25 1986 cells are displayed in the

lower panel of Table IV.     Other than the topmost row (STR

quintile 1), behavior induced by long-term performance is dif-
ficult to characterize.     Examination of AVOL means for any

column suggests no distinct investor reaction to varying short—

term performance measures.     STR marginal means follow no clear

pattern either.     This clearly indicates that the identity of in-

vestor incentives arising from short—term security performance

in previous years is no longer present.     Thus, the strongly

monotonic relationship displayed by the STR marginals for the

pooled sample broke down in December of 1986.
                                   25

       For completeness, Table V contains AVOL medians for the 25

cells for pooled data and 1986 data.      This data generally rein-

forces observations made from examination of the cell means in

Table IV.



                            V. Conclusions



       Much of our work reinforces findings by earlier authors

that tax effects were evident in December trading under prior
law.    However, we hypothesized that changes in this pattern were

likely during December 1986 as a result of changes in the tax
law that would take effect as of January      1,   1987.   By and large,
these hypotheses seem to have been substantiated by the data.

       First,   it is clear that there was reduced holding of long

term winners in 1986.     Normally these winners exhibited ab-

normally low trading volume.     However, in 1986, this pattern was

eliminated, even reversed.     This was very much in accord with

expectations.     second, contrary to expectations, the opposite
result did not occur for long term losers.         Little change in the

pattern of trading of long term losers was indicated.         Finally,
the usual reinforcing pattern of short term and long term ef-

fects was eliminated in December 1986.       The evidence incidates
that the usual patterns evidenced by portfolios paritioned by

both short and long term gains disappeared in 1986.

                                 FOOTNOTES


                                                        income
1.   Taxpaying investors with substantial capital gains
were often required to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax. This

tax, levied at a rate of 20 percent, was applied to ordinary in-
come as well as capital gains income.



2.     For calendar year     1987, the maximum capital gains tax rate

was set at 28 percent, although some taxpayers faced tax rates on

ordinary income as high as 38.5 percent.       Beginning in 1988, the

distinction between these caps was removed.



3.     This 11 month holding period represents a measure of short
term capital gains.        During the period under study in Dyl [3], a
                                                             for
holding period of at least 12 months was required to qualify
the favorable long term capital gains tax rate.



4.     While this strategy is technically an illegal "wash" sale

for the purposes of tax avoidance, investors could select

securities which are close substitutes or wait 30 days to

reestablish their positions.



5.     Of course,   if   the investor feels this   way, he can sell and

then repurchase the same security 30 days later.



6.     The National Bureau of Economic Research TAXSIM model is a
                                  29

computerized representation of the U.S. tax code which relies on

highly disaggregated data provided by the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice.     The economists responsible for creating TAXSIM include

Daniel Feenberg, Martin Feldstein, Lawrence Lindsey, and Andrew

Mitrusi.


7.      We also computed capital gains measures for holding periods

of 11 and 17 months.     One problem with the 11 month measure was

that it was classified as short term during part of our period of

analysis and long term in the remainder. Results derived from
the   17 month measure are consistent with those derived using the

23 month (LTR) measure.



8.      A more detailed description of this procedure can   be found

in Winkler and Hays [15).
