This paper is concerned with surveying, or interpreting, what can be learned from this literature; and our belief is that it has taught us a great deal.  We concern ourselves here not so much with the derivation of precise formulae, e.g. for optimal tax rates, but with the more general lessons which have emerged.\n\n",
