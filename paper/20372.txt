Corporate Taxes and Capital Structure:¸˛A Long-Term Historical Perspective
Francis A. Longstaff and Ilya A. Strebulaev
NBER Working Paper No. 20372
August 2014
JEL No. G32,G38
ABSTRACT
We study the relation between leverage and corporate tax rates using an extensive data set constructed
from all corporate income tax returns filed with the IRS from 1926 to 2009. This data set includes
financial statement data from millions of private and public corporations of all sizes. We show that
corporate leverage has increased significantly over the past century. We find strong evidence that changes
in corporate leverage are directly related to changes in corporate tax rates for all but the smallest firms.
These results are robust to the inclusion of control variables for the costs of financial distress, corporate
liquidity, and capital market and macroeconomic conditions. The adjustment of leverage to changes
in corporate tax rates is slower for smaller firms facing financial constraints. We find that the capital
structures of the smallest firms are driven much more by external shocks than is the case for larger
firms.

1. INTRODUCTION
The capital structure decisions of corporations have been one of the most important
areas of study in ﬁnancial economics ever since the pioneering studies of Modigliani
and Miller (1958, 1963). Corporate theory has identiﬁed a number of potential determinants of corporate capital structure such as taxes, bankruptcy costs, information
asymmetry, and agency problems.
In particular, the relation between corporate taxes and ﬁnancial decisions of ﬁrms
has played a central role in the capital structure literature. This is because the choice
of capital structure changes the after-tax value of the ﬁrm’s cash ﬂows. Thus, if
corporate taxes are material, optimizing capital structure should be an important
priority for ﬁrm managers who wish to maximize the total after-tax value of the
company. To date, however, there has not been strong evidence linking changes in
corporate income tax rates to corporate capital structure. As Graham (2008) puts it
in a review of research on taxation and corporate ﬁnance, “there is no known study
that documents tax-related time series eﬀects in debt usage.” At the same time,
recent theoretical research and some empirical estimates suggest that tax beneﬁts are
large and that ﬁrms may leave money on the table by not leveraging enough (Graham
(1996a, 2000)).
The challenges that face empirical researchers are two-fold. First, the time series
data are limited. For example, the US Compustat data cover only public ﬁrms and
goes back only to the early 1950s (adequate coverage starts only in the early 1960s).
The biggest US tax reform over that period, in 1986, is small in comparison with
changes in tax laws and rates during the ﬁrst half of the 20th Century. The second
challenge is that changes in tax laws and rates do not happen overnight but are
typically the result of multi-year policy negotiations between decision makers. As a
result, economic agents may sometimes have ample time to prepare and adjust for
the eventual tax reform. For example, the overall results on the eﬀect of the 1986 US
tax reform on capital structure are inconclusive (Slemrod (1992), Givoly, Hayn, Ofer,
and Sarig (1992)), likely because the reform itself was very complicated and ﬁrms had
time to adjust.
This paper studies the relation between corporate taxes and leverage using an
extensive new data set that allows us to resolve both of these challenges. Speciﬁcally,
the data set is constructed from an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all
corporate income tax returns ﬁled in the United States from 1926 to 2009. By using
nearly a century of capital structure data, our results provide clear answers about
the time series eﬀects of tax rate changes on corporate leverage for ﬁrms of all sizes.
Further, by spanning almost the entire history of the corporate income tax, the data
set allows us to evaluate the eﬀects of a much broader set of policy changes, many of
which may not have been fully anticipated.
A number of important results emerge from this analysis. First, we ﬁnd that there
1

has been a signiﬁcant upwards trend in the amount of corporate leverage throughout
much of the past century. In particular, the average corporate leverage ratio increased
from a low of 51.65 percent in 1931 to a high of 75.15 percent in 1978. Since the 1970s,
however, the average corporate leverage ratio has gradually declined and was 63.77
percent in 2009.
Second, we ﬁnd strong direct evidence that corporate leverage responds to changes
in corporate tax rates for all but the smallest ﬁrms. In particular, an increase in
the marginal corporate tax rate of one percent results in a 0.18 percent increase in
corporate leverage, representing roughly a $137 billion increase in aggregate corporate
leverage (based on 2009 statistics). In contrast, a one percent increase in the marginal
corporate tax rate would raise about $8 billion in additional tax revenue (based on
2009 statistics). The signiﬁcant positive relation between leverage and corporate tax
rates is robust to the inclusion of control variables for the costs of ﬁnancial distress,
corporate liquidity, and capital market and macroeconomic conditions. These results
provide direct empirical conﬁrmation of one of the central pillars of standard corporate
capital structure tradeoﬀ theory.
Finally, our results provide evidence that ﬁnancial constraints play a central role
in determining corporate capital structure. In particular, we show that large ﬁrms
adjust their capital structures much more rapidly in response to changes in marginal
corporate tax rates than do medium-size ﬁrms. In contrast, the capital structure
decisions of smaller ﬁrms are driven more by liquidity and proﬁtability shocks. Thus,
given that small and medium-sized ﬁrms likely face greater ﬁnancial constraints than
large ﬁrms, these results imply the ﬁrst-order importance of ﬁnancial constraints in
capital structure decisions.
There is an extensive empirical literature on the determinants of corporate capital structure. Because extensive time series data was previously unavailable, earlier
research in this area concentrated primarily on identifying cross-sectional factors inﬂuencing capital structure. For example, Mackie-Mason (1990) shows that there could
be signiﬁcant tax eﬀects in incremental ﬁnancing decisions. Rajan and Zingales (1995)
compare corporate ﬁnancial policies across a number of developed countries and ﬁnd
that cross-sectional variation in tax rates has some predictive power in explaining capital structure decisions. Fama and French (2002) ﬁnd that leverage is an increasing
function of the size of public companies. One challenge with cross-sectional determinants is that they do not establish the causality of the link between taxes and
ﬁnancial constraints. Several recent papers try to control for endogeneity by concentrating on natural experiments. For example, Panier, Perez-Gonzales, and Villanueva
(2014) study changes in Belgian tax law and ﬁnd that ﬁrms respond strongly to tax
incentives (particularly large ﬁrms). Heider and Ljungqvist (2014) ﬁnd that US ﬁrms
respond strongly to increases in state level corporate income tax rates.
Recent research has also emphasized that macroeconomic risk has a profound
impact on corporate ﬁnancing decisions (Hackbarth, Miao, Morellec (2006), Bhamra,
2

Kuehn, Strebulaev (2010)). Empirically, Korajczyk and Levy (2003) observed that
ﬁnancially unconstrained ﬁrms follow counter-cyclical leverage strategies, but ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms exhibit pro-cyclical leverage behavior. They also ﬁnd that
macroeconomic conditions are signiﬁcant for issue choice for unconstrained ﬁrms, but
less so for constrained ﬁrms. Consistent with this evidence, Gertler and Gilchrist
(1993) ﬁnd aggregate cyclicality of short-term availability in the presence of ﬁnancial
constraints.
An important recent paper by Graham, Leary, and Roberts (2014) is one of few
studies that explores long-term trends in corporate capital structure. They concentrate
on unregulated public US companies and show that ﬁrm characteristics are unlikely
to account for the long-term trends, such as an increase in the overall level of debt.
They attribute the rise of debt to changes in government borrowing, macroeconomic
uncertainty, and ﬁnancial sector development.
This paper extends the literature in several important dimensions. In particular,
by using data for millions of both private and public ﬁrms for a timeframe spanning
most of a century, we are able to identify the time series eﬀects of corporate tax
rate changes on corporate capital structure. Furthermore, by stratifying the data by
ﬁrm size, we are also able to explore the role that ﬁnancial constraints may play in
determining corporate capital structures.
The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 review the history of corporate
income taxation in the United States. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 studies
the relation between corporate taxes and leverage. Section 5 summarizes the ﬁndings
and presents concluding remarks.
2. THE US CORPORATE INCOME TAX
The taxation of corporate income in the United States has a long history. During the
Civil War in 1862, President Lincoln signed a revenue act that introduced a three to ﬁve
percent income tax, which also applied to income from businesses. This income tax was
repealed in 1872. In 1894, the Wilson Tariﬀ Act reinstated income taxation on both
personal and business income. The Wilson Tariﬀ Act was then ruled unconstitutional
a year later in 1895.1
The current corporate income tax was initiated in 1909 with the levy of a onepercent tax rate on corporate income in excess of $5,000. Thus, the corporate income
tax predates the 1913 introduction of the current personal income tax by four years.
The passage of the 16th Amendment in 1913 resolved the issue of the constitutionality
of both the personal and corporate income taxes.

Table 1 presents summary statistics for the corporate income tax rate schedule
throughout its history. As shown, corporate income tax rates have varied signiﬁcantly
over time, ranging from a low of one percent from 1909–1915 to a high of 53 percent
from 1942–1949. Table 1 also shows that the number of tax brackets, deﬁned as
the number of income ranges with distinct tax rates, has also varied dramatically
over time. The number of tax brackets ranges from one during 1913–1918 when all
corporate income was taxed at the same rate, to nine in 1940. It is also interesting
to observe that the maximum tax rate does not always occur for the highest tax
bracket. In other words, the corporate tax rate is not always an increasing function
of income. For example, the current corporate income tax schedule taxes corporate
income between $100,000 and $335,000 at the rate of 39 percent, while income above
the maximum threshold of $18,333,333 is only taxed at a 35 percent rate.
Since the corporate tax rate varies across income levels, we need some measure
of the marginal or representative tax rate.2 In this paper, we will use the simplest
deﬁnition of the marginal tax rate as the tax rate applied to the highest income tax
bracket. Figure 1 plots the time series of this measure of the marginal tax rate over the
past century. We observe, however, that all of the results are robust to the deﬁnition
of the marginal tax rate. In particular, the results are very similar when we use the
maximum tax rate or an average tax rate as the measure of the marginal tax rate.
3. THE DATA
The Revenue Act of 1916 mandated the annual publication of statistics associated
with the collection of income taxes. From 1916–1925, the total values of some income
and deduction items were published, where the values were aggregated across all tax
returns. Since 1926, the IRS has published aggregate basic balance sheet and income
statement information based on all of the millions of corporate income tax returns
ﬁled. This data is reported in the annual IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) publication.
Since this data set will likely be new to most researchers, we provide an introduction to
the SOI reports in the online Appendix to this paper and describe where this data may
be accessed in an eﬀort to facilitate future work by academic researchers. Beginning
in 1931, the IRS has also reported aggregate balance sheet and income statement data
for all ﬁrms within speciﬁc size categories. The number of size categories ranges from
8 to 12 during the 1931–2009 period.
To provide an example of the distribution of ﬁrms included in the SOI, Table 2
shows the total number of ﬁrms and total assets for all ﬁrms within each of the nine
size categories reported in 2009 by the IRS. The total number of corporate tax returns
included is 4,829,756. The distribution of returns, however, is heavily skewed towards
smaller ﬁrms. In fact, ﬁrms with total assets of less than or equal to $500,000 total
2

For a discussion of this issue, see Graham (1996b).

3,889,921, which represents 80.54 percent of all ﬁrms. In contrast, the distribution of
assets is heavily skewed toward larger ﬁrms. The total assets of all ﬁrms in the largest
size category is $70,497 billion, which represents 92.80 percent of all corporate assets.
It is interesting to compare the distribution of ﬁrms in the SOI universe with
those in the Compustat universe for the same year, since Compustat is one of the
most widely-used sources of data for historical accounting information for US public
companies. Table 3 shows the total number of ﬁrms and total assets for all ﬁrms
within the Compustat universe, where these summary statistics are reported using
the same format and size categories as in Table 2.
As shown, the 2009 Compustat universe includes information for 9,735 ﬁrms in
2009 (the SOI and Compustat universes include both ﬁnancial ﬁrms and nonﬁnancial
ﬁrms). Thus, the SOI universe includes roughly 500 times as many ﬁrms as the Compustat universe. This is because the SOI universe includes not only the public ﬁrms
included in the Compustat universe, but also millions of smaller nonpublic ﬁrms which
represent the vast majority of all corporations in the US. It is important to observe,
however, that the SOI data also includes many large ﬁrms that are not included in the
Compustat universe. For example, the SOI universe includes 14,110 ﬁrms in the $250
million and larger category, while the Compustat universe only include 3,812 ﬁrms in
the same size category. The reason for the diﬀerence is that the SOI data includes
many large nonpublic ﬁrms (such as Cargill, Levi Strauss, Bechtel, etc.) Thus, the
SOI universe is far more comprehensive, and signiﬁcantly extends Compustat in terms
of size, nonpublic ﬁrms, as well as the time dimension.
To make the SOI data comparable over time, we use the CPI-U index to convert
all balance sheet and income statement totals into constant 2009 dollars. To provide
greater consistency over time, we combine the totals for the size categories and form
three broader size categories. These three categories are designated small, medium,
and large. These three categories map into asset size ranges (in 2009 dollars) of
roughly zero to $10 million, $10 million to $100 million, and greater than $100 million,
respectively.
The balance sheet and income statement information is self reported by each
ﬁrm ﬁling a corporate tax return, although all information is subject to audit. While
there is undoubtedly variation in accounting policies across ﬁrms and also over time,
the deﬁnitions of most of basic balance sheet and income statement categories (such
as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, shareholders’ equity, etc.) are likely
relatively constant over time. Thus, leverage ratios computed using these values should
be generally consistent over time.
Although corporate tax returns are for a speciﬁc tax year, not all ﬁrms have the
same year end. For example, based on the 2009 Compustat universe, 60.9 percent of
ﬁrms have a December year end, 8.3 percent have a June year end, and the remaining
ﬁrms have year ends that are relatively uniformly distributed throughout the other

5

months of the year. The SOI uses the convention that the 2009 report is based on
the corporate income returns for tax years ending between July 1, 2008 and June 30,
2009, and similarly for reports for other years. As we will show later, this will have
little eﬀect on the results, since it simply increases the apparent time required by ﬁrms
to respond to changes in tax rates and other control variables.
The SOI reports for 1926–1950 are based on actual totals of all corporate tax
returns ﬁled. Beginning with 1951, totals for smaller size categories are based on a
stratiﬁed sampling of returns ﬁled. For example, for the 2009 SOI report, the values for
size categories below $50,000,000 are based on stratiﬁcation. Although this procedure
results in extrapolated values for totals, this procedure should have little eﬀect on
ﬁnancial ratios such as the leverage measure.
Table 4 presents summary statistics for common-size balance sheet (expressed
as a percent of total assets) and income statement (expressed as a percent of total
revenues) items for the small, medium, and large categories, as well as for all ﬁrms. As
shown, there are some interesting patterns in the average common-sized ratios across
the size categories. For example, cash represents a much larger fraction of total assets
for smaller ﬁrms that it does for the medium-sized and large ﬁrms. This ﬁnding is
clearly consistent with the notion that smaller ﬁrms face greater ﬁnancial constraints
and, therefore, hold more liquid portfolios of assets as protection against shocks. This
pattern is also reﬂected in the much smaller fraction of total assets that smaller ﬁrms
invest in longer term investments.
Not surprisingly, larger ﬁrms tend to be more proﬁtable on average. Earnings before taxes represents only 2.45 percent of total revenues for small ﬁrms, but represents
7.32 percent for the large ﬁrms. Because large ﬁrms are historically more successful,
and because successful small ﬁrms become larger ﬁrms with time, path dependency
drives this result. Small ﬁrms include successful ﬁrms that are more likely to migrate
to the large category and also include many unproﬁtable ﬁrms that are likely to stay
small or disappear from the sample altogether.
The ratio of corporate taxes to earnings before taxes is 33.1 percent for small
ﬁrms, 42.9 percent for medium-sized ﬁrms, and 38.4 percent for large ﬁrms. This
shows that corporate taxes are a signiﬁcant fraction of earnings for all size categories
even though the corporate tax rate schedule has historically been relatively progressive.
Furthermore, the incidence of taxation is not monotonic with ﬁrm size, suggesting that
larger ﬁrms may have more ﬂexibility in structuring their corporate tax liabilities.
A comparison of these ﬁnancial ratios for the SOI universe with those for Compustat ﬁrms indicates that they are fairly similar. In particular, we compute average
common size ratios for SOI ﬁrms during the 1960–2009 period and compare them with
those for Compustat ﬁrms during the same period. For example, cash, receivables,
inventories, and capital assets represent 5.54, 21.73, 5.37, and 18.83 percent of total
assets for SOI ﬁrms, respectively. The same ratios for Compustat ﬁrms are 4.03, 28.39,

6

8.17, and 27.70 percent, respectively. Similarly, earnings before taxes and corporate
taxes paid are 4.50 and 1.72 percent of total revenues for SOI ﬁrms, respectively. The
same ratios for Compustat ﬁrms are 7.87 and 3.56 percent, respectively.
Turning next to corporate leverage, we compute the leverage ratio by simply
taking the ratio of total debt to total assets for each year and size category. In this
context, debt includes all liabilities of the ﬁrm such as accounts payable and accruals
as well as formal indebtedness such as bank loans, mortgages, and corporate bonds.
This ratio is also equal to one minus the ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets.
Empirical researchers typically prefer to use leverage ratios that are based on book
values of debt rather than liabilities, because liabilities include items such as working
capital ﬁnancial needs, which are more indicative of day-to-day operating environment
than of voluntary ﬁnancial decisions. SOI data reports only liabilities. However,
because our emphasis is on time-series patterns, this distinction is of less importance,
unless the composition of debt and non-debt liabilities changed dramatically over time.
Rajan and Zingales (1995) also report ratios based on liabilities, because their aim
is to compare leverage ratios across diﬀerent countries and the deﬁnition of debt-like
liabilities varies with the accounting regime. It should also be noted that empirical
researchers overwhelmingly work with large ﬁrms, for which debt-like liabilities can
take the form of corporate bonds, commercial paper, and so on – that is, “pure” debt.
Most of our data is based on small private ﬁrms, where the distinction between debt
and non-debt liabilities is moot, because most of these ﬁrms do not have access to
public debt markets.
Table 5 presents summary statistics for the leverage ratios for each of the three
size categories and for all ﬁrms. Figure 2 plots the leverage ratio for all ﬁrms for the
1926–2009 period. As illustrated, the leverage ratio for all ﬁrms also varies signiﬁcantly
over time. The highest corporate leverage ratios occur during 1970s when they reached
a level in excess of 75 percent.
As a preliminary to the formal empirical analysis later in the paper, Figure 3
presents a scatterdiagram of the level of the marginal corporate tax rate and the level
of aggregate corporate leverage for the 1926–2009 period. As shown, there is a strong
positive relation between the two measures.
Figure 4 plots the time series of leverage ratios for the small, medium, and large
size categories. These leverage ratios are generally increasing throughout the 1931–
2009 period. The leverage ratios for the medium-sized and large ﬁrms, however, reach
a maximum in 1988 and then begin to decline. In contrast, the leverage ratio for small
ﬁrms continues to increase. Thus, there is a clear diﬀerence between the properties of
small ﬁrms and the other ﬁrms.
Returning to Table 5, the results suggest that average leverage is monotonically
increasing in ﬁrm size. The average leverage ratio is 60.7 percent for small ﬁrms, 64.4
percent for medium-sized ﬁrms, and 67.5 percent for large ﬁrms. The lower average

7

leverage for smaller ﬁrms is again consistent with the perspective that smaller ﬁrms
face greater ﬁnancial constraints and are less able to acquire outside funding.
On the other hand, leverage ratios for smaller ﬁrms tend to be more volatile than
those for larger ﬁrms. Speciﬁcally, the leverage ratios for small ﬁrms range from 38.0
to 76.6 percent during the sample period. In contrast, the leverage ratios of larger
ﬁrms ranges 53.2 to 76.3 percent, which is a much tighter range than for small ﬁrms.
The diﬀerence in the volatility of leverage ratios across size categories could reﬂect
that smaller ﬁrms are more susceptible to liquidity and funding shocks through the
business cycle. Thus, they may have less ability to choose their capital structure than
larger ﬁrms.
It is important to recognize that there are other ways in which the leverage of a
ﬁrm can be deﬁned. For example, a number of papers focus on the net leverage ratio,
given by subtracting cash from total debt, and then dividing the diﬀerence by total
assets. To show that our results are robust to this alternative deﬁnition of leverage, all
of the empirical analyses are repeated using net leverage. These results are included
in the online Appendix as Tables A1 through A5. As these tables show, the results
using the net leverage ratio are all very similar to those obtained using the leverage
ratio.
Finally, we note that the average leverage ratios for the SOI ﬁrms are very similar
to those for Compustat ﬁrms. Speciﬁcally, the average leverage ratio for all SOI ﬁrms
during the 1960–2009 period is 69.90 percent. The ratio of liabilities to total assets
for all Compustat ﬁrms during the same period is 71.18 percent.

4. HOW DO CORPORATE TAX RATES AFFECT LEVERAGE?
The standard tradeoﬀ theory of capital structure implies that corporate tax rates
should be a major determinant of corporate leverage decisions. In this section, we test
the empirical implications of this theory by examining how corporate tax rates are
related to corporate leverage over time. In doing this, we make use of the extensive
time series of corporate capital structure information available from the SOI reports.
An important advantage of this data set is that it allows us to study the relation
between leverage and tax rates almost from the inception of the corporate income tax.
Speciﬁcally, our empirical approach will be to test whether changes in corporate
tax rates are related to subsequent changes in corporate leverage. The reason for
focusing on subsequent changes in leverage rather than contemporaneous changes is
that ﬁrms may require time to respond to changes in tax rates because of the eﬀects
of ﬁnancial frictions. Furthermore, this approach helps lessen potential endogeneity
issues. The reason for focusing on changes rather than levels is simply that both
corporate tax rates and leverage ratios tend to be highly persistent. In contrast,
changes in these variables appear more stationary.
8

In testing whether changes in tax rates are followed by changes in corporate capital structure, we also include a number of other explanatory variables as controls. In
the ﬁrst speciﬁcation, we include several lags of the change in leverage to control for
potential persistence in leverage changes. In the second speciﬁcation, we add variables
that proxy for changes in the cost of ﬁnancial distress. In the third speciﬁcation, we
include variables controlling for the liquidity and internal cash ﬂows of the corporations. In the ﬁnal speciﬁcation, we include variables controlling for the state of debt
and equity capital markets.
4.1 The Eﬀects of Tax Rate Changes
As an initial speciﬁcation, we regress changes in leverage on its lagged values and
on lagged changes in the marginal corporate income tax rate. In particular, we use
the ﬁrst two lags of the change in leverage as a control for any persistence in the
dependent variable (longer lags are not signiﬁcant). To test whether changes in tax
rates are followed by changes in leverage ratios, we also include the ﬁrst three lags of
the change in the marginal tax rate.
Table 6 presents the results from the regression. As shown, changes in leverage
display some degree of persistence. The second lagged change is positive and weakly
signiﬁcant in the regression including all ﬁrms. This result, however, is not uniform
across the individual size categories. Both the small and medium categories have a
signiﬁcant negative coeﬃcient for a lagged change in leverage. This suggests that the
leverage ratios for small and medium-sized ﬁrms tend to be mean reverting, in sharp
contrast to the persistent behavior of leverage ratios for large ﬁrms. This pattern of
diﬀerences in the behavior of capital structure across size categories will be a recurring
theme throughout much of the subsequent empirical analysis in the paper. It is also
consistent with previous empirical ﬁndings about the diﬀerences in capital structure
policies of small and large ﬁrms (Korajczyk and Levy (2003), Gertler and Gilchrist
(1993) and others).
Turning next to the eﬀect of changes in tax rates, the results for the regression
including all ﬁrms indicate that there is a strong positive relation between changes in
marginal tax rates and subsequent changes in corporate leverage. In particular, the
ﬁrst lagged change in the marginal tax rate has a t-statistic of 2.30. The coeﬃcient estimates for the lagged changes in marginal tax rates imply that one percent change in
the marginal tax rate cumulates to an increase in the leverage ratio of 0.0018, or 0.18
percent. While this increase may seem modest as a percentage, it represents an increase in aggregate corporate leverage of nearly $137 billion (based on 2009 statistics).
This increase is very large relative to the roughly $8 billion of incremental annual corporate income tax revenue that a one percent increase in the marginal tax rate would
generate (again based on 2009 statistics). These results are clearly consistent with the
hypothesis that tax rates are an important determinant of corporate capital structure.
9

The results for the regressions for the individual size categories are also very
intriguing. As shown in Table 6, lagged changes in the marginal tax rate are not
signiﬁcant in explaining subsequent changes in the leverage of small ﬁrms. In contrast,
there is a signiﬁcant positive relation between lagged changes in the marginal tax
rate and subsequent changes in leverage for both medium-sized and large ﬁrms. This
distinction suggests that the capital structure of small ﬁrms may be driven by diﬀerent
factors than is the case for larger ﬁrms. For example, small ﬁrms may face ﬁnancial
constraints that limit their ability to optimize capital structure, while larger ﬁrms may
have more control over their capital structure. This is consistent with recent dynamic
capital structure models that emphasize optimal inaction by ﬁrms in the presence
of transaction costs (Goldstein, Ju, Leland (2001), Strebulaev (2007)). If transaction
costs have a ﬁxed cost component, it gives rise to diﬀerences between capital structure
determinants of small and large ﬁrms (Kurshev and Strebulaev (2007)).
Although there is a signiﬁcant positive relation between leverage and marginal
tax rates for medium-sized ﬁrms, the result shows that the nature of that relation
is subtly diﬀerent than for large ﬁrms. In particular, changes in leverage occur two
to three years after changes in the marginal tax rate for the medium category, but
occur during the subsequent year for large ﬁrms. This diﬀerence is consistent with
medium-sized ﬁrms facing ﬁnancial frictions which make changing capital structure a
slower process than for larger ﬁrms.
4.2 The Costs of Financial Distress
The standard tradeoﬀ theory of capital structure implies that the optimal leverage
is determined by balancing the tax advantages of debt against the costs of ﬁnancial
distress. Motivated by this, we next examine the relation between changes in leverage
and corporate tax rates while including a number of controls for the cost of ﬁnancial
distress associated with leverage.
Speciﬁcally, we include three variables as instruments for the cost of ﬁnancial
distress. The ﬁrst is the annual value-weighted default rate of nonﬁnancial corporate
bonds in the US. This variable is described in Giesecke, Longstaﬀ, Schaefer, and
Strebulaev (2011, 2013), and the time series of default rates is obtained from their
online Appendix. As shown in their papers, corporate defaults tend to cluster in time
and are persistent. Thus, an increase in the corporate default rate implies an increase
in expected default rates in the subsequent year. As shown by Acharya, Bharath, and
Srinivasan (2007) and many others, recovery rates tend to be lower during periods
characterized by higher default rates. In turn, lower recovery rates map into higher
expected costs of ﬁnancial distress.
The second and third variables are the growth rates in GDP and industrial production, respectively. As shown by Davydenko, Strebulaev, and Zhang (2012), the
costs of ﬁnancial distress are industry related and tend to be weakly counter-cyclical.
10

Thus, we would expect the expected costs of ﬁnancial distress to increase during business cycle downturns. Including the growth rate in GDP and industrial production in
the analysis should control for business cycle variation in the cost of ﬁnancial distress.
Table 7 reports the results for the regression in which these three variables are
added to the regression reported in Table 6. We include only one lag of these variables
since the results are unaﬀected by the inclusion of additional lags, and additional
lagged values of these variables are generally insigniﬁcant.
As shown, the implications for the relation between tax rates and leverage are very
similar to those reported in Table 6. In particular, lagged changes in the corporate
tax rate are signiﬁcantly positively related to subsequent changes in leverage when all
ﬁrms are included, and also for the medium and large categories. Changes in corporate
tax rates are not signiﬁcantly related to changes in leverage for small ﬁrms.
The lagged value of the corporate default rate is signiﬁcant in explaining subsequent changes in the leverage of small ﬁrms. Surprisingly, the sign of the coeﬃcient
is positive, implying that an increase in the risk of defaults and the expected cost
of ﬁnancial distress is associated with higher leverage for these smaller ﬁrms. This
seemingly counterintuitive result may imply, once again, that the capital structure of
smaller ﬁrms may be driven more by ﬁnancial constraints and other external factors
than by endogenous choices. For example, a higher expected likelihood of distress is
associated with a decline in proﬁtability and lower shareholder equity, which, in turn,
leads to higher leverage. This may also apply to ﬁrms in the medium category since
their leverage is signiﬁcantly positively related to lagged industrial production growth.
4.3 Firm Liquidity and Internal Capital
Recent literature emphasizes the central role that ﬁnancial constraints play in determining the capital structure of corporations.3 Firms that face severe constraints or
frictions may ﬁnd that changes in the leverage ratio over time are heavily inﬂuenced
by the amount of internal cash ﬂow generated by operations or the liquidity of their
assets.
In light of this literature, we extend the analysis by including a number of proxies
for ﬁrm liquidity and internal cash ﬂow. In particular, we calculate the cash and
current ratios for ﬁrms in the three size categories as well as for the combined total of
all ﬁrms. The cash ratio is simply the ratio of cash to total assets. The current ratio is
the ratio of current assets to total assets, where current assets include cash, accounts
receivable, and inventories. To provide a measure of internal cash ﬂow, we compute
3

See Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004), Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (1999), Gryglewicz (2011), Acharya, Davydenko, and Strebulaev (2012), Anderson
and Caverhill (2012), and Pinkowitz, Sturgess, Williamson (2013).
11

the proﬁtability ratio as the ratio of earnings before taxes to total assets. Table 8
reports the results from the regression in which lagged changes in these three liquidity
and internal cash ﬂow measures are added to the baseline speciﬁcation reported in
Table 6.
The results show that the implications for the relation between changes in corporate tax rates and subsequent changes in leverage are essentially the same as in the
prior regressions. In particular, changes in tax rates are not signiﬁcant in explaining
changes in leverage for small ﬁrms. As before, the leverage of medium-sized ﬁrms is
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by changes in tax rates after a two- or three-year delay. The
leverage of large ﬁrms increases signiﬁcantly in the year after an increase in tax rates.
The results for the regression in which all ﬁrms are included are the same as in the
previous regressions.
Turning to the results for the liquidity and internal cash ﬂow variables, Table 8
shows that the leverage of small ﬁrms is strongly inﬂuenced by these variables. Both
the lagged change in the current ratio and the lagged proﬁtability ratio are highly
signiﬁcant in explaining the subsequent change in the leverage ratio for small ﬁrms.
These results are consistent with the view that the capital structure of ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms or ﬁrms facing ﬁnancial frictions is strongly related to the liquidity of
their assets or their internal free cash ﬂows. A similar result holds for the medium category in that lagged changes in the current ratio are signiﬁcantly related to subsequent
leverage changes.
In contrast to these results, Table 8 shows that none of the three liquidity or profitability ratios are signiﬁcant in explaining subsequent changes in leverage for either
the large ﬁrm category or for the combined total of all ﬁrms. This again demonstrates
that the determinants of capital structure for larger and presumably less ﬁnancially
constrained ﬁrms diﬀer in important ways from those for smaller ﬁrms.
4.4 The Eﬀects of External Capital Markets
As discussed earlier, corporate capital structure could be inﬂuenced by events in the
external capital markets. To address this, we reexamine the relation between changes
in corporate tax rates and subsequent changes in leverage while controlling for a
number of measures of market factors.
Speciﬁcally, we include three additional variables in the baseline regression reported in Table 6. The ﬁrst is the lagged return on the Center for Research in Security
Prices (CRSP) value-weighted index. This return series serves as a control for the conditions in the equity markets. The second variable is the year-on-year change in the
volatility of the CRSP value-weighted index. The volatility of the index is estimated
each year by taking the standard deviation of the monthly returns on the index during
the year. The third variable is the change in the yield spread between Baa-rated and
12

Treasury bonds. This index is available from Moody’s throughout the sample period.
Table 9 reports the results from the regression of changes in corporate leverage on its
ﬁrst two lags, the ﬁrst three lags of the change in the corporate tax rate, and on the
ﬁrst lag of these capital market variables.
Once again, the implications of the regression for the relation between changes in
corporate tax rates and subsequent changes in leverage indicate that there is a strong
relation for larger ﬁrms, a signiﬁcant but delayed relation for medium-sized ﬁrms, and
no apparent relation for small ﬁrms. The coeﬃcient estimates for the lagged changes in
corporate tax rates and their statistical signiﬁcance are very similar to those reported
in previous regressions.
Table 9 also shows that the lagged stock return is not signiﬁcant for any of the
size categories or for the regression with all ﬁrms included. It is also not signiﬁcant
for the lagged change in the corporate bond spread. In contrast, there is a marginally
signiﬁcant relation between changes in volatility and the subsequent change in leverage
for the large ﬁrm category and in the regression with all ﬁrms. The sign of these
coeﬃcients is negative, consistent with a scenario in which these ﬁrms adjust the
leverage downward when facing more volatile ﬁnancial markets.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we study the relation between corporate taxes and corporate capital
structure using long-term historical data from US corporate tax returns. The data
is based on all corporate tax returns ﬁled in the US for nearly a century by millions
of corporations. This study contributes to the growing empirical literature on capital
structure determinants by analyzing a much longer time series for a larger sample of
companies than in any previous study. On the other hand, the data we have access to
is based on aggregated size categories rather than individual tax returns.
We ﬁnd a strong relation between taxes and capital structure. Changes in tax
rates are related to an increase in corporate leverage. When we explore the diﬀerences
with respect to ﬁrm size, we ﬁnd that only large ﬁrms are responsive to changes in
tax rates over a short period of time. Medium-sized ﬁrms exhibit higher leverage with
a lag, and leverage ratios of small ﬁrms are not related to the time series variation in
tax rates. This evidence is consistent with the presence of ﬁnancial constraints with a
ﬁxed component that delay the response of medium-sized ﬁrms and make it too costly
for small ﬁrms to vary their leverage in response to tax incentives. These results are
robust when we consider time-series proxies for corporate distress costs, corporate
proﬁtability, macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth and stock returns, and
changes in volatility.

Introduction to the IRS Statistics of Income
The IRS provides an extensive introduction to the Statistics of Income Program on its
website at http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-About-SOI. As discussed on this
website, the Revenue Act of 1916 requires the IRS to publish an annual report relating to the operations of the internal revenue laws pertaining to the collection of
taxes from individuals, and all forms of business including corporations, estates, nonproﬁt organizations, and trusts. The SOI program fulﬁlls this mandate through its
information oﬃce, Statistical Information Services.
Beginning in 2009, the IRS began to digitize its library of historical reports, and these
are now all available online. In particular, the website http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOITax-Stats-Archive contains links to pdf versions of the annual SOI reports from 1916
to 1933 which contain statistics for both individuals and business returns. Beginning
in 1929, the IRS published a separate annual report for businesses, and the above
archive website contains links to these reports for the 1929 to 1999 period. The US
Bureau of the Census has summarized much of the key information about corporate ﬁnancial statements from the SOI annual reports for the period from 1926 to
1970 in its publication Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to
1970, Part 2. More recent annual reports for corporate tax statistics can be found at
http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Corporation-Complete-Report.
Robustness Analysis Using Net Leverage
The empirical results in Tables 5 through 9 of the paper are based on the leverage
ratio, which is deﬁned as the ratio of total debt to total assets. As a robustness check,
we repeat the analysis in these tables using net leverage, which is deﬁned as the ratio
of total debt minus cash to total assets. The results using this alternative measure
of leverage are given below as Tables A1 through A5, where Table A1 corresponds to
Table 5, Table A2 corresponds to Table 6, etc. As can be seen by comparing the results
in Tables A1 through A5 with the corresponding tables in the paper, the empirical
results using the net leverage ratio are virtually identical to those in the paper based
on the leverage ratio.

Online Appendix
Introduction to the IRS Statistics of Income
The IRS provides an extensive introduction to the Statistics of Income Program on its
website at http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-About-SOI. As discussed on this
website, the Revenue Act of 1916 requires the IRS to publish an annual report relating to the operations of the internal revenue laws pertaining to the collection of
taxes from individuals, and all forms of business including corporations, estates, nonproﬁt organizations, and trusts. The SOI program fulﬁlls this mandate through its
information oﬃce, Statistical Information Services.
Beginning in 2009, the IRS began to digitize its library of historical reports, and these
are now all available online. In particular, the website http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOITax-Stats-Archive contains links to pdf versions of the annual SOI reports from 1916
to 1933 which contain statistics for both individuals and business returns. Beginning
in 1929, the IRS published a separate annual report for businesses, and the above
archive website contains links to these reports for the 1929 to 1999 period. The US
Bureau of the Census has summarized much of the key information about corporate ﬁnancial statements from the SOI annual reports for the period from 1926 to
1970 in its publication Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to
1970, Part 2. More recent annual reports for corporate tax statistics can be found at
http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Corporation-Complete-Report.
Robustness Analysis Using Net Leverage
The empirical results in Tables 5 through 9 of the paper are based on the leverage
ratio, which is deﬁned as the ratio of total debt to total assets. As a robustness check,
we repeat the analysis in these tables using net leverage, which is deﬁned as the ratio
of total debt minus cash to total assets. The results using this alternative measure
of leverage are given below as Tables A1 through A5, where Table A1 corresponds to
Table 5, Table A2 corresponds to Table 6, etc. As can be seen by comparing the results
in Tables A1 through A5 with the corresponding tables in the paper, the empirical
results using the net leverage ratio are virtually identical to those in the paper based
on the leverage ratio.

Table A1
Summary Statistics for Corporate Net Leverage Ratios. This table reports summary statistics for the corporate net leverage ratio (net
leverage over total assets, where net leverage is defined as debt minus cash) for the indicated categories. Small, Medium, and Large denote
firms with total assets of roughly less than $10 million, between $10 and $100 million, and greater than $100 million, respectively (measured
in current (2009) dollars). The sample period for the individual size categories is 1931–2009. The sample period for the category including all
firms is 1926–2009.

Table A4
Regression of Changes in Net Leverage on Changes in the Tax Rate and Firm Liquidity and Profitability Measures. This
table reports summary statistics from the regression of the change in the net leverage ratio (net leverage over total assets, where net leverage
is deﬁned as debt minus cash) on its ﬁrst two lags, the three previous changes in the corporate tax rate for the highest bracket, the previous
changes in the ratios of cash and current assets to total assets, and the previous ratio of earnings before taxes to total assets. Small, Medium,
and Large denote ﬁrms with total assets of roughly less than $10 million, between $10 and $100 million, and greater than $100 million,
respectively (measured in current (2009) dollars). The t-statistics are based on the Newey-West estimate of the covariance matrix (three lags).
The superscripts ∗ and ∗∗ denote signiﬁcance at the ten-percent and ﬁve-percent levels, respectively. The sample period for all categories is
1931–2009.

Table A5
Regression of Changes in Net Leverage on Changes in the Tax Rate, Stock Returns, and Changes in Volatility and Corporate
Credit Spreads. This table reports summary statistics from the regression of the change in the net leverage ratio (net leverage over total
assets, where net leverage is deﬁned as debt minus cash) on its ﬁrst two lags, the three previous changes in the corporate tax rate for the
highest bracket, the previous return on the stock market, and the previous changes in stock market volatility and corporate credit spreads.
Small, Medium, and Large denote ﬁrms with total assets of roughly less than $10 million, between $10 and $100 million, and greater than
$100 million, respectively (measured in current (2009) dollars). The t-statistics are based on the Newey-West estimate of the covariance matrix
(three lags). The superscripts ∗ and ∗∗ denote signiﬁcance at the ten-percent and ﬁve-percent levels, respectively. The sample period for the
individual size catergories is 1931–2009. The sample period for the category including all ﬁrms is 1926–2009.
