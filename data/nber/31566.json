    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide the first systematic account of summer declines in women\u2019s labor market activity. From May to July, the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age US women declines by 1.1 percentage points, whereas male employment rises; women\u2019s total hours worked fall by 9.8 percent, more than twice the decline among men. School closures for summer break\u2014and corresponding lapses in implicit childcare\u2014provide a unifying explanation for these patterns. The summer drop in female employment aligns with cross-state differences in the timing of school closures, is concentrated among mothers with young school-age children, and coincides with increased time spent engaging in childcare. Decomposing the gender gap in summer work interruptions across job types defined by sector and occupation, we find large contributions from both gender differences in job allocation and gender differences within job types in the propensity to exit employment over the summer. Women\u2019s summer work interruptions contribute to gender gaps in pay: women\u2019s weekly earnings decline by 3.3 percent over the summer months, about five times the decline among men.\n\n",
