    "abstract": "\n\nIn Happiness for All?, Carol Graham raises disquieting ideas about today\u2019s United States.  The challenge she puts forward is an important one.  Here we review the intellectual case and offer additional evidence.  We conclude broadly on the author\u2019s side.  Strikingly, Americans appear to be in greater pain than citizens of other countries, and most sub-groups of citizens have downwardly trended happiness levels.  There is, however, one bright side to an otherwise dark story.  The happiness of black Americans has risen strongly since the 1970s.  It is now almost equal to that of white Americans.\n\n",
