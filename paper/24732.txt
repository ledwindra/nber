The Gender Earnings Gap in the Gig Economy: Evidence from over a Million Rideshare Drivers

ABSTRACT
The growth of the “gig” economy generates worker flexibility that, some have speculated, will
favor women. We explore this by examining labor supply choices and earnings among more than
a million rideshare drivers on Uber in the U.S. We document a roughly 7% gender earnings gap
amongst drivers. We completely explain this gap and show that it can be entirely attributed to
three factors: experience on the platform (learning-by-doing), preferences over where to work
(driven largely by where drivers live and, to a lesser extent, safety), and preferences for driving
speed. We do not find that men and women are differentially affected by a taste for specific
hours, a return to within-week work intensity, or customer discrimination. Our results suggest
that there is no reason to expect the “gig” economy to close gender differences. Even in the
absence of discrimination and in flexible labor markets, women’s relatively high opportunity cost
of non-paid-work time and gender-based differences in preferences and constraints can sustain a
gender pay gap.

Introduction

The wage gap between men and women has narrowed throughout the past four decades, with
2010 estimates suggesting women earn 88 cents on the dollar when compared to similar men in
similar jobs (Blau and Kahn (2017)).1 Much of the remaining wage gap can be explained by
fewer hours worked and weaker continuity of labor force participation by women, especially for
middle-age workers where gender wage gaps are largest (Bertrand et al. (2010) and Blau and Kahn
(2017)). Goldin (2014) has suggested that work hours and disruption in labor force participation
dramatically lower wages due to a “job-flexibility penalty,” where imperfect substitution between
workers can lead to a convex hours-earnings relationship. In contrast, the role of on-the-job training
(Mincer and Polachek (1974)) is thought to play an economically smaller role (Blau and Kahn
(2017)).2
It is possible that the growth of the “gig” economy could help narrow the gender wage gap
in the economy. Gig economy jobs divide work into small pieces and then offer those pieces of
work to independent workers in real-time, allowing for easy substitution of work across workers.
This ease of worker substitutability should severely limit a “job-flexibility penalty,” and potentially
exhibit little to no gender pay disparity. Indeed, Hyperwallet (2017) reports that “86% of female
gig workers believe gig work offers the opportunity to make equal pay to their male counterparts.”
Further, estimates suggest about 15% of U.S. workers primarily do independent work, that 30%
do some independent work, and that the share is growing (Katz and Krueger (2016), Oyer (2016),
and McKinsey Global Institute (2016)). As more industries gravitate towards using gig work, the
importance of the the job-flexibility penalty in gender wage inequality could weaken.
In this paper, we make use of a sample of over a million drivers to quantify the determinants of
the gender earnings gap in one of the largest gig economy platforms: Uber’s platform for connecting
riders and drivers. Uber sets its driver fares and fees through a simple, publicly available formula,
which is invariant between drivers. Further, similar to many parts of the larger gig economy, on
Uber there is no negotiation of earnings, earnings are not directly tied to tenure or hours worked per

See Table 4 Panel B of Blau and Kahn (2017), combining the residual wage gap with the effects of experience.
Blau and Kahn (2017) note that the evidence here is mostly based on older studies (Light and Ureta (1995)).
Indeed, data on experience often contain sizable measurement error in traditional datasets (Blau and Kahn (2013)).

week, and we can demonstrate that customer-side discrimination is not materially important. These
job attributes explicitly rule out the possibility of a “job-flexibility penalty.”3 We use granular data
on drivers and their behaviors in a given hour of the week to precisely measure driver productivity
and returns to experience.
We find that men earn roughly 7% more per hour than women on average, which is in line
with prior estimates of gender earnings gaps within specifically defined jobs (Bayard et al. (2003),
Barth et al. (2017)). We can explain the entire gap with three factors. First, through the logic
of compensating differentials, hourly earnings on Uber vary predictably by location and time of
week, and men tend to drive in more lucrative locations. This is largely because male drivers tend
to live near more lucrative locations and because men earn a compensating differential for their
willingness to drive in areas with higher crime and more drinking establishments.
The second factor is rideshare-specific human capital. Even in the relatively simple production
of a passenger’s ride, past experience is valuable for drivers. A driver with more than 2,500 lifetime
trips completed earns 14% more per hour than a driver who has completed fewer than 100 trips
in her time on the platform, in part because she learns where and when to drive and how to
strategically cancel and accept trips. Male drivers accumulate more experience than women by
driving more each week and being less likely to stop driving with Uber. Because of these returns
to experience and because the typical male driver on Uber has more experience than the typical
female—putting them higher on the learning curve—men earn more money per hour.
A unique aspect of our data is our ability to both precisely measure a driver’s experience and
measure the return to experience through improved driver productivity, holding fixed the compensation schedule. Traditional datasets studying the gender pay gap often have very poor measures
of experience (usually just a worker’s age, sometimes years of employment). This measurement
error in experience leads to attenuated estimates of the return to experience. We show that this
measurement error in experience can lead to biased estimates of the job-flexibility penalty. When
we remove our precise measure of experience (number of rides completed) and replace is with the
3

This is in contrast with taxi markets in cities such as New York with supply-limiting medallions. In these
markets, because the cost of switching drivers is that a valuable medallion will be off the road, contracts are generally
structured to make it uneconomical for taxi drivers not to work a very long day. See Haggag et al. (2017).

typical measure used in other papers (a quadratic in driver age), we find a convex hours/earnings
relationship in Uber drivers. Drivers who drive 30+ hours per week for Uber earn a 9% higher
hourly wage than those who driver fewer than 10 hours per week. However, once we add in our
precise controls for driver experience, we find a concave hours/earnings relationship. Drivers working 30+ hours per week earn 7% less per hour than those working fewer than 10 hours per week.
For Uber drivers, this is likely due to drivers who work fewer hours per week being able to cherry
pick high pay hours, while those working full-time must work some of the less lucrative times.
Because workers who work long hours also accumulate human capital at a faster rate per week,
the importance of the job-flexibility penalty in the gender pay gap might be overstated in studies
lacking good measures of worker experience. Separating out the importance of job-flexibility versus
the return to experience for the gender pay gap in the broader economy is critical for formulating
policy. Policies that improve job-flexibility (such as moving towards gig work) may only have a
modest effect on the gender gap if the returns to experience are a key driver of the hour-earnings
relationship.
The residual gender earnings gap that persists after controlling for these experience and where
and when drivers work can be explained by a single variable: average driving speed. Increasing
speed increases expected driver earnings in almost all Uber settings. Drivers are paid according to
the distance and time they travel on trip and, in the vast majority of cases, the loss of per-minute
pay when driving quickly is outweighed by the value of completing a trip quickly to start the
next trip sooner and accumulate more per-mile pay (across all trips). Men’s higher driving speed
appears to result from preferences as we see no evidence that drivers respond to the incentive to
drive faster. Men’s higher average speed and the productive value of speed for Uber and the drivers
(and, presumably, the passengers) enlarges the pay gap in this labor market.
We interpret these determinants of the gender pay gap—a propensity to gain more experience,
choice of different locations, and higher speed—as preference-based characteristics that are correlated with gender and make drivers more productive.4 While much prior work has also shown a
relationship between the gap and factors that are likely to be related to preferences, we know of
4
For the purposes of this paper, we use “preferences” to refer to an individual’s optimal choices given his/her
constraints. Naturally, men and women may face different constraints that will impact these choices.

no prior work that fully decomposes the gender earnings gap in any setting. Beyond measuring
the gender earnings gap and unpacking it completely in an important labor market, our simple
analysis provides insights into the roots of the gender earnings gap and, following the approach
described in Gelbach (2016), the share of the pay gap that can be explained by each factor. First,
driving speed alone can explain nearly half of the gender pay gap. Second, over a third of the
gap can be explained by on-the-job learning, a factor which is often almost impossible to evaluate
in other contexts that lack high frequency data on pay, labor supply, and output. The remaining
gender pay gap can be explained by choices over where to drive. Men’s willingness to supply more
hours per week (enabling them to learn more) and to target the most profitable locations shows
that women continue to pay a cost for working reduced hours each week, even with concavity in
the hours-earning schedule. As the gig economy continues to grow, it will likely bring even more
flexibility in earnings opportunities, which is valued by at least some workers (Angrist et al. (2017)
and Chen et al. (2017) document the value of flexibility to drivers) if not by all workers (see Mas
and Pallais (2017)). However, the returns to experience and the temporal and geographic variation
in worker productivity will likely persist and thus lead to a persistent gender earnings gap.
We also show that at least three factors that one might expect to favor men in the labor market
and to be relevant for Uber drivers do not contribute to men making more. Customers do not
discriminate by gender of driver, there is not a financial return to work intensity within a period
of time (for example, driving forty hours per week instead of twenty), and women do not suffer a
financial penalty for the specific hours of the day and days of the week that they choose to drive.
The fact that these issues do not penalize women suggest that the non-discriminatory and flexibly
nature of gig work may help women to achieve pay equity conditional on accumulated experience
and some dimensions of preferences.
Our paper, like a few others that have come before, focuses on gender differences within a
single company and/or a narrowly defined set of workers.5 For example, Bayard et al. (2003)
uses employer-employee matched data in the US from 1989 to analyze within-establishment gender
pay gaps. They find a gender pay gap of 16% within occupations and establishments, which can

account for about 50% of the overall pay gap. Since these results are almost three decades old and
the economy-wide gender gap has narrowed substantially in the intervening years (Blau and Kahn
(2017)), this suggests our Uber gender gap of 7% is likely not far from the typical within-firm gap.
Several prior papers have shown clear empirical connections between gender pay gaps and
factors that are likely related to gender differences in preferences. Bertrand et al. (2010) show
that the gender gap among graduates of a single prestigious MBA program starts small but widens
considerably. The growth in the gender gap can be explained almost entirely by differences in hours
worked (due to a combination of women working fewer hours per week, conditional on working, and
being more likely to have gaps in their careers) which can, in turn, be explained by child rearing.6
The mechanism for the hours/earnings connection is unclear as the authors cannot determine
whether the female earnings penalty is due to a convex hours-earnings relationship or a learningby-doing effect. Our results (though in a very different context) are surprisingly similar and our
data enable us to quantify the importance of learning-by-doing and to rule out (at least for drivers
on Uber) work intensity as a driver of the gap.
Other papers find broadly similar results. Azmat and Ferrer (2017) document a large earnings
premium for men among young lawyers in the United States that is largely attributable to factors
related to hours worked such as hours billed and new clients brought in. Gallen (2015) analyzes a
broad sample of Danish workers and find that mothers are much less productive than other women
or men, which explains most of the wage difference.
The returns to hours worked need not generate a gender gap, however, as Goldin and Katz
(2016) show in their study of the market for pharmacists. Pharmacists have become increasingly
female over time, the gender pay gap amongst pharmacists is a small 4%, and the gap only exists for
women who have children. As compared to the MBAs in Bertrand et al. (2010), the importance of
hours and child rearing is economically weaker and there is no evidence of a “job-flexibility penalty.”
Other papers have attributed part of the gender gap to factors unlikely to be important in the
rideshare market—differences in willingness to bargain and firms sharing rents with employees. See
6

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the analysis in Barth et al. (2017). They look at the gender gap over
careers and by education. They show that the gender gap grows substantially with age for the college-educated due
to men’s pay rising faster within establishments.

Card et al. (2015) and Hirsch et al. (2010) using matched employee/employer data from Portugal
and Germany, respectively, Black and Strahan (2001) studying U.S. banks upon deregulation, and
a broader analysis of gender and negotiations in Babcock and Laschever (2003). Lab experiments
such as Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) and field experiments such as Flory et al. (2015) suggest
that another contributing factor to the gender pay gap is that women disproportionately shy away
from competition. Other papers show that some of the gender gap can be explained by differential
sorting (which could be at least partially due to differences in preferences), including Card et al.
(2015), Gupta and Rothstein (2005), and Bayard et al. (2003). Sorting is not relevant in our
context, as we study a single firm. However, there clearly is gender-based sorting into rideshare
driving given that our sample is overwhelmingly male.
The paper proceeds with a description of our data and the documenting of a 7% hourly earnings
gender gap among well over a million drivers on Uber. Having established that there is a gender
earnings gap for drivers, we study the details of how drivers are compensated so that we can break
down all components that affect driver pay. We focus on drivers in the Chicago metropolitan area
to reveal the primary determinants of the earnings gap, though we also show, using data from
several other cities, that our conclusions are invariant to the market we choose. We conclude with
implications and summary remarks.

2.1

Uber: Background and Data
The Uber Marketplace

Uber’s software connects riders with drivers willing to provide trips at posted prices. Riders can
request a trip through a phone app, and this request is then sent to a nearby driver. The driver can
either accept or decline the request during a short time window after seeing the rider’s location.
If the driver declines the ride, then the request is sent to another nearby driver. Some products
slightly vary this experience. For example, UberPOOL trips may involve picking up multiple riders
traveling along a similar route. At the end of each ride, the passenger and driver rate each other
on a scale from one to five stars.

6

Drivers have full discretion regarding when and where they work. Unlike wage and salary
workers, drivers do not receive standard employee benefits like overtime or (for many, but not all,
wage and salary workers) healthcare. A comprehensive discussion of the classification of drivers as
independent contractors is out of the scope of this paper, but driver independence is convenient for
this study insofar as we do not need to consider differential value for different kinds of compensation
beyond monetary compensation and flexibility.
Drivers are paid according to a fixed, non-negotiated formula. For a given trip, the driver
earns a base fare plus per-minute and per-distance rates for the time and distance from pickup to
dropoff. In times of imbalanced supply and demand, as manifested by high wait times and few
available drivers, a “surge” multiplier greater than one may multiply the time and distance-based
fare formula. Importantly, there are no explicit returns to tenure (e.g., promotion), convex returns
to hours worked (i.e. higher hourly pay for 50 hours of work than 20 hours of work in a week), or
opportunities for earnings discrepancies based on negotiated pay differentials on Uber.7
In our analysis, we will essentially be treating earnings as equivalent to productivity. This is a
reasonable assumption on any single trip, as driver earnings for a trip are highly correlated with
rider fares.8
One concern is that, if a driver takes an action that increases or decreases a rider’s demand for
future Uber rides, then a trip’s revenue could overstate or understate the driver’s marginal product
of labor for that ride. For our analysis, this is only an issue if there are differences by driver
gender in how drivers affect future demand. To address this, we looked at the ratings passengers
provide for drivers at the end of each ride. Reassuringly for our approach, the average of rider
ratings of drivers is statistically indistinguishable between genders. When we regress ratings on
gender and the control variables used throughout the paper, we find an economically trivial (and,
7

Occasionally, certain promotions will pay for convex hours worked by rewarding drivers for hitting certain thresholds of weekly trips; however, these thresholds are tailored to drivers based on their driving frequency in past weeks
and attainable even for infrequent drivers. Further, incentives are a small portion of the average driver’s pay and our
results hold when considering only “organic” pay.
8
Before Summer 2016, driver pay and rider fares for a trip were directly coupled, with a percentage service fee taken
by Uber. However, rider fares are now “decoupled” and, while correlated with driver earnings, are not mechanically
tied to earnings. Furthermore, while Uber now allows riders to tip their drivers in-app, this did not become available
until June 2017, which is outside the scope of our data. We do not believe that cash tips – which were possible before
in-app tipping – had a material impact on driver earnings.

in most specifications, statistically insignificant) relationship between driver gender and ratings.
These analyses provide some reassurance that there are not important differences by driver gender
in drivers’ effects on Uber’s reputation or a rider’s propensity to take future Uber rides.
In our analysis, we focus on the UberX and UberPOOL products to ensure that drivers in our
data were completing comparable work and faced similar barriers to entry; other Uber products
may have alternative pay structures (e.g., UberEATS) or stricter car and license requirements (e.g.,
UberBLACK).

2.2

Driver Earnings

For each trip completed, drivers are paid a base fare plus a per-mile and per-minute rate. In
Chicago (as of 2017), drivers are paid a $1.70 base fare plus $0.20 per minute and $0.95 per mile
for each UberX trip (which are all, at times of high demand, multiplied by the surge multiplier).9
Drivers can also earn money from “incentives.” For example, drivers may be offered additional
pay for completing a set number of trips in a week. Another type of incentive guarantees drivers
a certain surge level for trips taken within a given geography and time (e.g. 1.4x all fares in the
Chicago Loop during rush hour). While the use of incentives has varied over time, on average they
account for under 9% of a driver’s hourly earnings in our data.
With all of these components in mind, we formalize the driver’s effective hourly earnings p(·)
for a given trip as


p(·) = 60 ∗ 

where rb , rd , and rt respectively represent the base fare, per-mile, and per-minute rates, SM is
the surge multiplier, d0 is the distance between accepts and pickup, d1 is the distance on trip, s is
speed, w is wait time for dispatch, and I represents the incentive earnings associated with the trip.
For UberPOOL trips—where multiple riders heading in the same direction can ride together—
the pay formula treats the chain of trips as a single trip. The driver still receives a base fare for

number of riders in the car.

2.3

National Data

Our national data include all driver-weeks for drivers in the U.S. from January 2015 to March
2017. We limit the data to drivers for Uber’s “peer-to-peer services,” UberX and UberPOOL;
drivers who have completed a trip on other products such as UberXL, UberBLACK, or UberEATS
are excluded.11 The resulting data include over 1.87 million drivers, about 512K of whom are
female (27.3%).12 In total, we observe almost 25 million driver-weeks in 196 cities.13
For each driver-week, we track total earnings and hours worked. We compute hourly earnings
as the total payout in that week divided by hours worked. For the purposes of this paper, a driver
is considered to be “working” whenever the app is on and available for trips; that is, while on a trip,
en route to a pickup, or available for a dispatch. All earnings are gross earnings. Costs such as gas,
car depreciation, and Uber’s service fee have not been subtracted from the earnings we present.14
We discuss costs in more depth in the appendix.

2.4

National gender earnings gap

Table 1 presents summary statistics of driver pay overall by gender. Active drivers gross an average
of $376 per week and $21 per hour. More than 60% of those who start driving are no longer active
on the platform six months later (though some of these drivers may be on an extended break).
Comparing across gender in Table 1, we find a first hint of differences between male and female
10

UberPOOL rates are sometimes marginally lower than UberX rates. In Chicago, the per-mile and base fare are
identical to UberX, but the per-minute rate is 6 cents lower.
11
UberEats has a different pay structure than ride sharing, paying piece-rate for pickups, dropoffs, and miles driven,
and has less stringent vehicle requirements for drivers. Results are consistent with or without UberEats drivers (who
make up approximately 13% of the sample). UberBLACK drivers are commercially licensed and may face large
regulatory barriers to entry depending on the city.
12
This percentage is higher than the number of active women drivers in a given month due to women having higher
attrition (Table 1).
13
We follow Uber’s definition of city, which does not always match canonical definitions. For example, the state of
New Hampshire is considered a single city.
14
Uber increased its service fee from 20% to 25% in September 2015; however, drivers who joined before then were
grandfathered in and still pay only 20%. This differentially impacts women, who are more likely to have joined the
platform more recently. We look at earnings before the service fee is applied.

drivers. Men make nearly 50% more per week than women, which is primarily a reflection of their
choice to work nearly 50% more hours per week. On an hourly basis, men make over $1/hour
more.15 Men are also less likely to leave the platform.

Note: Values are based on all UberX/UberPOOL driver-weeks in the US from January 2015 - March 2017. The percent
of drivers who are female varies across city; to mitigate composition effects, we weight averages at the city level by total
number of drivers in a city, rather than by number of male (or female) drivers. 6 month attrition rate is defined as the
percent of drivers who are no longer active 26 weeks after their first trip. We consider drivers to be active on a given date
if they complete another trip within another 26 weeks of that date. For calculating attrition rate, we subset to drivers
who completed their first trip between Jan 2015 and March 2016 to allow us to fully observe whether they are inactive,
per the definition above, 26 weeks after they join.

Figure 1 provides a graphical view of the hourly earnings gap for all U.S. drivers from early
2015 through early 2017. The gap seen in Table 1 is fairly constant throughout the sample period.
Pay of drivers fluctuates, but the changes are generally gender neutral.
Table 2 uses these national data and measures the gender pay gap through a set of standard
Mincer regressions. Specifically, we estimate

ln(Earningsdt ) = β0 + β1 isM aled + ρXdt + d

(2.2)

for driver d in time period t, where Earnings are the gross weekly or hourly earnings in that time
period, as described above, isM ale is an indicator variable for a driver’s gender, and Xdt is a set
of controls such as week and city indicator variables.
15
An informal survey by The Rideshare Guy, a blog covering ridesharing, found a gender pay gap of over $2 per
hour; however, in addition to being self-reported earnings, this does not control for gender composition effects across
cities (The Rideshare Guy (2017)).

10

Figure 1: Average hourly earnings, US

Note: Data based on hourly earnings averaged across all UberX and UberPOOL drivers who worked in a given week. The
percent of drivers who are female varies across city; to mitigate composition effects, we weight averages at the city level
by total number of drivers in a city, rather than by number of male (or female) drivers. Earnings are gross; costs such as
the Uber commission or gas are not subtracted.

Table 2 provides clear evidence that, when examining almost two million drivers across the
United States (representing more than one percent of the US workforce) and controlling for the
city and the conditions for a given week, there remains a substantial gender pay gap. Men in the
US earn about 7% more than women when the analysis is done at the hourly level, indicating that,
while a substantial majority of the weekly earnings gender gap is simply due to men driving more
hours, there is still a sizable gap when looking at hourly earnings.
This gap may seem surprising: men make 7% more per hour, on average, for doing the same
job in a setting where work assignments are made by a gender-blind algorithm and the pay structure is tied directly to output and not negotiated. The 7% differential is as large or larger than
hourly differentials in other narrowly defined, relatively homogeneous groups such as recent MBAs
(Bertrand et al. (2010)) and pharmacists (Goldin and Katz (2016)), but is smaller than the differential in economy-wide samples (Blau and Kahn (2017)).
Throughout the rest of the paper, we focus on drivers in Chicago to decompose the gender gap
and analyze its economic roots. This choice reduces the dataset to a more tractable size and allows

Note: This table documents the gender pay gap for all US cities from January 2015 to March 2017. Data are at the driverweek level; weekly earnings is the entire pay for a given week, while hourly earnings is the pay divided by hours worked in
the week. Standard errors (clustered at the driver-level) in parentheses.

for more granular data. As shown in Table 2, when the same regressions are done on Chicago drivers
alone, the weekly gender earnings gap in Chicago mirrors the national gap and the hourly Chicago
gender earnings gap is somewhat lower, at approximately 5%. This small difference between the
national and Chicago gap is due to cross-city differences in the factors that explain the gap. We
analyze these factors in detail in Chicago, which provides more insight into the roots of the gap
than if we were to focus on the generally small differences across cities. In Section 5, we present
results for a sample of other large cities and demonstrate our results are consistent across cities.

Decomposing the Wage Gap — Chicago
Chicago Data

By focusing attention on Chicago drivers, we can examine data at the driver-hour, rather than
driver-week, level.16 A driver-hour is defined as a full hour block with some trip activity; for
example, 8-9am on a specific Monday. We continue to restrict the data to peer-to-peer drivers in
January 2015 to March 2017.
16
Analyzing a city at a time allows us to include fine controls for hour-of-week and geography at a driver-hour
level. Using national data, this would be computationally impractical.

12

The Chicago dataset includes 120,223 drivers, 36,391 of whom are female (30.2%). In total, we
observe 33.0 million driver-hours.17 As before, we track total gross pay and hours worked for each
driver-hour. We compute the implied hourly earnings in a driver-hour as total earnings for trips
in that hour divided by minutes worked*60. For trips that span driver-hours, we distribute the
pay uniformly between the hours based on the trip time in each hour. In Chicago, certain types of
incentive earnings are paid for achieving weekly trips targets, rather than tied to individual trips.
We spread these earnings uniformly across minutes worked in the week for which the incentive was
earned.
Before using regressions to formally decompose the gender earnings gap shown in Figure 1
(which looks nearly identical when looking only at Chicago), we examine average differences across
gender in the factors that determine driver earnings. Recall from Equation 2.1 that driver earnings
are a function of wait time between trips, distance to the start of the ride from where the driver
accepts it, distance of the ride, speed (both on the ride and on the way to pick up the passenger),
the surge rate at the time of the ride, and incentive payments.
Table 3 displays the average of these parameters by gender. Note that these averages are
presented on a per-trip basis, as that is a more natural way to divide some of the parameters.
Table 3 also provides an idea of the sources of the gender pay gap. First, notice that the differences
are generally small. Only the difference in incentive payout is more than a few percentage points
and, given the incentive difference is nine cents while the average earnings per trip are about $10,
incentives are unlikely to drive the gap. Second, while the individual differences are small, nearly
every one of the parameters favors men earning more. Men have shorter trips to the rider, longer
trips, faster speed, higher surge, and more incentives.18 Women appear to have marginally lower
wait times, but the difference is neither statistically nor economically significant. The remainder of
our analysis explores which of these differences in Table 3 are important drivers of the Uber gender
pay gap and what underlies the differences.
Moving to driver-hour level granularity allows us to control for certain features of a driver’s
17

Regressions are run on a 35% subset of drivers. Results are robust to different samples.
Equation 2.1 implies that trip distance and speed are ambiguously related to earnings; however, for the values of
the other parameters that we observe in the data, earnings are almost always increasing in both distance and speed.
18

behavior in a given driver-hour. We can now control for where a driver worked, the time of day
and day of week, lifetime trips to-date, and whether the driver rejected a dispatch or canceled a
trip that hour. To control for driving location, we track the “geohash” where a driver is located
when he or she accepts a trip. A geohash is a geocoding system that divides the world into a grid
of squares of arbitrary precision. For our case, we use geohashes that are approximately three miles
by three miles.19 We focus on the top fifty Chicago geohashes by trip density, which account for
89.2% of trips. The remaining trips are grouped into an “other” bin. For chains of UberPOOL
trips, we only include the geohash of the first trip in the chain; drivers do not have control over
where to locate for subsequent trips in the chain.
Table 4 refines the initial Chicago gender pay gap analysis we originally displayed in Table
2. However, whereas Table 2 utilized weekly observations (the hourly rate in that table is the
average hourly rate for a driver in a week) to remain consistent with the regression models using
the national data, Table 4 uses driver-hour observations.
Column 1 of Table 4 reveals a baseline Chicago gender pay gap of 3.6% at the driver-hour level,
controlling only for overall conditions in a given week.20
Before getting to the factors that explain the gender pay gap, we show in Column 2 of Table
4 that customer (that is, passenger) discrimination is not creating a gender gap in this setting.
While the Uber rider/driver matching algorithm is gender-neutral, customer discrimination could
contribute to Uber gender pay differences if riders disproportionately cancel trips when paired with
a female driver.21 After requesting a trip, riders see the name and a small image of the driver
and can choose to cancel the trip. Drivers also see this information about the rider so one gender
could also be at a pay advantage or disadvantage if it canceled rides upon seeing the passenger
information. Column 2 controls for canceling on both sides of the transaction and shows that
19
Within busy areas of Chicago, this is a fairly large area and there may be differences in demand and congestion
even within these areas that limit our ability to fully control for geographic effects. We have experimented with finer
geographic areas and, given the conclusions do not change, we have not found this worthwhile given the additional
computational complexity.
20
This number is lower than the corresponding estimate in Table 2 because the weighting is by driver-hour rather
than driver-week, effectively up-weighting drivers who work more hours in a week. This affects the measured gap for
reasons similar to those we discuss below as we decompose the gap.
21
Though many studies have hypothesized about customer discrimination and hypothesized that wage residuals may
be due to customer preferences (especially race-based discrimination), prior work has not been able to conclusively
establish if or when customer discrimination contributes to gender pay gaps.

14

discrimination has no effect on the gender coefficient suggesting that discrimination on either side
of the market is not a primary cause of the pay gap.22
The entire gender pay gap is explained in Column 3 where we include measures of where drivers
work (the geohash indicators), when (the hour-of-week indicators), driver experience buckets, and
the log of driving speed. We can statistically rule out a gender gap in favor of either gender of
greater that 0.6 percentage points (and much less than that if we use the entire dataset rather than
a subsample). To our knowledge, no other paper has ever estimated such a precise “zero” gender
gap in any setting. The rest of the paper focuses on explaining just how the various controls in
Column 3 contribute to erasing the non-trivial gender gap of approximately 3.6% with which we
started.23

Note: This table documents averages for men and women of the parameters in Equation 2.1. Averages are per-trip based on
trips in Chicago between January-February 2017 to avoid issues with seasonality and changes in the composition of driver
experience. Wait time is based on time between either coming online or completing previous trip and picking up passenger
for new trip. Trip distance is based on actual route taken; however, accepts-to-pickup distance is the Haversine distance
between corresponding coordinates. Standard errors in parentheses.

22

In the average driver-hour, total cancellation rates are statistically equivalent between men and women.
Column 4 confirms that the gap is again unaffected by cancellations when controlling for other factors. It also
shows that cancellations by either side of the market are, on average, costly for drivers.

Note: This table documents both the base gender pay gap and the gender pay gap once controlling for experience, location,
time, and speed. Data are at the driver-hour level. Further, it includes specifications with rider and driver cancellations.
The outcome variable is log of hourly earnings. Hour of week controls for each of 168 hours. Geohash controls are a vector of dummies for whether a driver began a trip in a given geohash. Driver experience is measured by a driver’s lifetime
trips completed prior to a given date, where lifetime trips is binned into 0-100 trips, 100-500 trip, 500-1000 trips, 1000-2500
trips, and >2500 trips. Driving speed is the speed driven while on trip in a given driver-hour. Standard errors (clustered
at the driver-level) in parentheses.

3.2

Where & When Drivers Work

Men and women drive at different times of the week and different locations across the city. Figure 2
shows the distribution of time spent driving across the 168 hours of a week; men drive more during
the late night hours, while women drive substantially more on Saturday and Sunday afternoon. The
first panel of Figure 3, which maps the fraction of trips in a given geohash that are completed by
men, shows that trips in the more Northern parts of the city are more commonly completed by men.
These differences in driving habits—whether due to inflexible schedules, preferences, or differential
costs to driving in certain locations (e.g., far from home)—may contribute to the observed gender
pay gap.
Table 5 starts to break down the baseline pay gap of 3.6% in column 1 of Table 4. Column
1 adds 168 indicator variables for the hour of week, which eliminate 14% of the gender pay gap.
This suggests that, while the variation in preferences for driving hours documented by Chen et al.
(2017) may be correlated with gender, hour-within-week preference differences are a small part of
the gender gap. If female drivers receive more non-pecuniary benefits than men from picking which
hours to work, they do not pay a large financial price for this flexibility.
Column 2 of Table 5 adds controls for the top fifty Chicago geohashes. This removes about
a quarter of the gender pay gap, indicating that men drive in the parts of Chicago where pay is
higher due to factors such as higher surge and shorter waiting times. Per Column 3, the “where
and when” variables together attenuate the gender earnings gap by about a third.24
Overall, the first three columns of Table 5 show that time and location explain some, but not all,
of the gender earnings gap. The remaining gender earnings differential of 2.2% is small compared
with overall gender pay gaps measured in the literature, but it is substantial given we are exploring
workers doing exactly the same job at the same time and location and being paid by a gender-blind
algorithm.
24

Specifications including the interaction of location and hour had little additional explanatory power, suggesting
that the hour of week earnings differentials are fairly consistent across areas of Chicago.

17

Figure 2: Distribution of hours of the week worked by gender

Note: This figure shows which hours of the week men and women work; each point represents the fraction of their total
hours in the week that men (or women) spend working in that specific hour of the week. Data are limited to Chicago
UberX/UberPOOL drivers in Chicago, January 2015-March 2017.

3.2.1

Features of Driving Locations

Features of locations—such as safety, likelihood of picking up an intoxicated rider, and proximity
to a driver’s home—may impact a drivers’ propensity to drive there and may do so differentially
for men and women. To investigate this, we construct a dataset at the geohash-level with data
on crime levels, businesses with liquor licenses, the gender of drivers living nearby, and gender of
the overall adult population. Due to limitations in the availability of crime data, we restrict our
main data to driver-hours with trips only in City of Chicago area.25 Per Column 4 of Table 5, the
baseline gender pay gap in this subset is slightly larger than the overall population – 4.3% versus
3.6%. A detailed description of the data construction is available in the Appendix.
Figure 3 maps the percent of trips beginning in a geohash that are by male drivers. There is
considerable variance in the percent of trips completed by men in a given geohash; in the North
parts of Chicago, men often complete >85% of trips compared to ∼70-80% of trips in the South and
West sides of Chicago. Figure 3 also maps various features of the geohashes that may correlate with
25

This limits us to 68.8% of our original observations.

18

driving location: the percent of drivers living nearby who are men, the gender divide in the adult
census population, the number of crimes per 1,000 adult residents, the number of liquor licenses,
and the median household income. Most notable are the similarities between home locations and
where men and women drive. The locations where Uber trips are completed predominantly by
men are also the locations where the population—both of drivers on Uber and the overall adult
population—is skewed more male. The locations with more female trips (and a higher percent of
female residents) also face higher crime rates. As such, unconditional on where they live, women
are more likely to drive in areas with higher crime rates.
In Appendix Table 11, we regress the log share of male trips against various features of a geohash.
Absent controls for home location, women drive in areas correlated with higher crime; however,
once controlling for home locations, an increase in either crime or liquor licenses is correlated with
a decrease in the share of women driving in that location. Women appear to avoid locations that
may be unsafe, either due to crime or more intoxicated drivers. However, safety considerations
are secondary to where drivers live. Controlling for driver home locations alone has far greater
explanatory power; drivers work close to where they live. This result is not unique to Uber;
individuals in traditional labor markets may also work close to home due to the pecuniary costs
and disutility associated with commuting and these effects may differ by gender (Madden (1981)).
Columns 5 of Table 5 shows the results of earnings regressions including the average crime rates
and number of liquor licenses in the geohashes where drivers begin a trip in a given driver-hour.
There are small compensating differentials for working in areas with higher crime or more bars; a
10% increase in the number of crimes is correlated with a 0.43% increase in pay and a corresponding
increase in number of liquor licenses is correlated with a 6.75% increase in pay.26 Further, when
controlling only for driver experience, hour of week, driving speed, driver home locations, and the
features of geohashes instead of the actual geohashes, the gender gap is statistically indistinguishable
from zero.
These results show that the lower costs associated with driving near one’s home are an important
factor in where drivers operate. They also show results consistent with women having a stronger

See Appendix Table 12 for the mean and standard deviation of the various geohash features.

19

preference than men for avoiding areas with a higher incidence of crime or where there is a higher
likelihood of picking up intoxicated passengers. This preference affects their ability to earn money
on Uber, as there are small compensating differentials for driving in areas with higher crime rates
or more liquor licenses. Overall, however, residential sorting of drivers appears to be a much more
important determinant than safety considerations for determining where drivers work.

Returns to Experience

As shown by Bertrand et al. (2010), the gender earnings gap tends to rise with workers’ years of
experience. However, measures of experience in traditional datasets tend to be quite coarse. Often,
we only observe years since graduation from school or years employed in a given profession as the
best metric of experience. Measurement error may lead to attenuated experience effects. One of

20

Figure 3: Features of geohashes

Note: This figure maps various features at the geohash-level for the City of Chicago. The distribution of trip locations is
based on where trips originate. The geohashes used are more precise than those used in regressions, measuring about
0.75 miles on each side. Population numbers—both driver home locations as well as total adult population from the 2016
ACS—are smoothed by measuring population within one mile of a given geohash. Crimes include all non-residential
crimes and are normalized by the number of crimes per 1,000 adult residents. Liquor licenses are based on number of
unique businesses with a liquor license active during our time sample in a given geohash. Median household income is
from the 2016 ACS. For crime and liquor licenses, the distributions are winsorized at 250 and 30, respectively, to allow
for more informative coloring.

the unique aspects of working with Uber data is that we can measure a driver’s experience level
(number of previous rides given) with high precision.
Indeed, there is much to learn being a driver on Uber. Uber pays according to a fixed formula,
but many of the parameters of the formula (that is, the variables listed in Table 3) are within the
driver’s control. For example, drivers can indirectly affect the surge multiplier and wait times by
choosing where and when to work and directly affect their driving speed by simply driving faster.
As drivers work more, they can begin to learn optimal driving behaviors to maximize earnings.27
27
Another activity that may generate a return to experience is “dual-apping,” which is when drivers accept trips
from both Uber and a competitor (primarily Lyft). Dual-apping has the potential to increase earnings due to less

21

As a result, none of the increased earnings with experience comes from a pre-set pay schedule that
“mechanically” raises pay with experience. Any experience premium results from learning and
increased driver productivity.28
Figure 4 provides a visual indication of why possible returns to experience can affect the gender
earnings gap. The figure, which shows the average tenure of all drivers with a completed trip in
January 2017, reveals that men are far more likely to have been driving on Uber for over 2 years.
Women are likely to have joined in recent months. Further, Figure 5 shows that men accumulate
completed trips at a faster rate per week than women. Since women supply fewer hours of labor per
week, they accumulate experience more slowly per week, even if they accumulate the same amount
of experience per ride given.
Figure 6 demonstrates the raw driver returns to experience as measured by cumulative number
of trips driven. There is a clear learning curve, which is especially steep early in a driver’s tenure.
Drivers continue to learn valuable skills on the job through at least 2,500 trips with a fully experienced driver earning about $3 per hour (more than 10%) more than a driver in his or her first
500 trips. In principle, the rise in earnings shown in Figure 6 could be a selection effect if better
drivers last longer on the Uber platform. While there is some degree of selection into staying on
the platform based on earnings, Figure 6 looks nearly identical if we limit the graph to drivers
that complete at least 1,000 trips or that drive for Uber for at least six months. This suggests
the pattern in Figure 6 is a true learning effect. In the Appendix, we discuss the selection issue in
more detail and also show that men and women do not learn at different rates as they accumulate
experience.
In Table 6, we return to our earnings regression and show that there are substantial returns to
experience on Uber. Column 1 shows that drivers who have completed over 2500 trips make nearly
14% more than those in their first 100 trips. Gender differences in average experience are clearly
time waiting for a dispatch and the ability to filter higher-value trips if the surge multiplier differs across platforms.
We do not have a credible way to determine the degree to which this affects earnings nor whether specific drivers are
dual-apping, so we cannot isolate dual-apping’s contribution to the return to experience.
28
Haggag et al. (2017) show that learning-by-doing and experience are important for New York City taxi drivers.
While drivers on Uber may learn in some ways similar to taxi drivers, there are likely important differences. For
example, Uber rates fluctuate with surge prices (unlike fixed taxi fares), Uber uses an assignment algorithm to offer
trips to drivers, drivers on Uber use in-app GPS, and drivers are not customarily paid a tip on Uber (during the time
period of our data).

22

Figure 4: Distribution of driver tenure, January 2017

Note: This figure shows the average weeks of tenure for drivers that completed a trip in January 2017; we limit to a single
month to avoid composition effects. Tenure is measured as the number of weeks since a driver’s first completed trip.

Figure 5: Accumulation of trips over weeks of driving

Note: This figure shows the average number of lifetime trips completed for drivers of a certain tenure. Tenure is based on
the number of weeks since a driver completed their first trip. The data only include driver-weeks with >0 trips.

Figure 6: Returns to experience

Note: This figure shows the average earnings of drivers with a given number of rolling trips completed prior to a day of
work; rolling trips are binned into buckets of 100 trips completed. Data include all Chicago drivers from January 2015 to
March 2017.

important as, controlling for experience, the gender earnings gap shrinks to 1.4% or roughly a third
of the initial earnings gap in Chicago.29
With controls for hour of week (Column 2), the gender gap is further reduced to under 1%, but
the returns to experience do not change noticeably. On the other hand, controls for driver location
(Column 3) do not reduce the gender gap but substantially reduce the returns to experience.
Combined, these two columns suggest that the primary effect of experience on earnings comes from
learning where to drive and that men and women have differences in terms of their preferences for
when to drive.
In addition to deciding where and when to drive, drivers can affect their earnings through
strategic actions. We consider two such strategic actions: rejecting dispatches and canceling trips.
When drivers receive a dispatch, they are told where the rider is and the estimated time-to-pickup.
They can then choose to accept or reject the dispatch. This information can be valuable in assessing
29

These five bins of experience capture the relevant value of experience. We have experimented with other parametric forms of experience in these regressions and the results are qualitatively similar.

24

the quality of a given dispatch. If a rider is particularly far away, then there is an additional cost;
recall that drivers are not compensated for the time it takes to drive to meet a rider.30 If a driver
has reason to think that, by rejecting a ride, he or she will be offered a closer dispatch shortly, that
driver may be able to increase expected earnings by not accepting the first dispatch. Savvy drivers
will also realize that a high time-to-pickup ride may indicate an imbalance in supply and demand
that may soon be corrected by a higher surge.31
Once a driver accepts a dispatch, the driver can cancel the trip before picking up the rider.
After accepting, drivers are able to contact the rider. Some may do so to learn about the rider
destination—for example, calling and asking if the rider is headed to the airport—and canceling
if the driver believes the trip will not be worth the time.32 Experienced drivers may also learn to
cancel when they have reason to believe the rider will not show up.
Table 7 adds dummy variables that indicate whether a driver rejected a dispatch or canceled
a trip during a given driver-hour to our prior regressions. Controlling for time and geography,
there is a negative impact on earnings of rejecting a dispatch or canceling a trip. However, this
negative effect decreases as experience increases (while still remaining negative). Receiving a bad
draw dispatch can never have a positive effect on earnings. A driver either completes the trip,
which likely took longer than it was worth, or recognizes that it was a bad draw, rejects or cancels
it, and then must wait for the next dispatch. As drivers gain experience, they can more accurately
estimate the trade-off between rejecting and having to wait for a new dispatch versus accepting
and completing a potentially low value trip.
These and earlier regressions show that drivers become more productive (and earn more) as
they learn where to drive, when to drive, and how to strategically cancel and accept trips. However,
even with controls for strategic rejecting and canceling, and when/where to driver, drivers with over
2500 trips make 6.2% more than those in their first 100 trips; there are substantial (but smaller)
returns to experience that remain that go beyond these observable measures.
30
Effective October 2017, Uber initiated a system where drivers are paid (and riders are charged) for particularly
long pickups.
31
Surge rates update every two minutes.
32
While this is feasible, it is against Uber’s community guidelines, which prohibit “destination discrimination,” and
may result in deactivation. It is unclear how stringently these guidelines are enforced as identifying true destination
discrimination is difficult.

25

While Table 7 sheds light on the driver learning process, these regressions leave the Uber gender
pay gap unaffected. There are returns to learning how to reject/cancel, which affect men and women
differently because of their correlation with driver experience. However, holding driver experience
constant, men and women do not differentially accept or reject trips in a way that affects their pay.
In all of our analyses, there are no gender differences in the learning process. Learning affects the
gender gap because, though each additional ride teaches men and women the same valuable skills,
men accumulate ride experience (and, therefore, information) faster than women.33

Note: This table expands on the regressions in Table 4 by adding controls for a driver’s experience. Experienced is measured
as trips completed before a given day of work. Drivers with fewer than 100 completed trips are the excluded category. The

Experience and the Long-Hours Premium

In other settings, a gender gap has been shown to grow over time as women accumulate fewer
hours of on-the-job experience (e.g., Bertrand et al. (2010)). In most of those settings, however,
men are working more hours in each week and they have accumulated more experience, making it

Note: This table expands on the regressions in Table 6 by adding covariates for whether a driver rejected a dispatch or canceled a trip in a given hour. Data are at the driver-hour level. The outcome variable is log of hourly earnings. Standard

difficult to empirically distinguish between the value of accumulated experience and work intensity.
While our setting differs from the more professional settings of prior studies, we do have similar
patterns in the value of accumulated experience and we can empirically distinguish between the
role of intensity and past experience.
Figure 7 shows the results of pay regressions similar to those in Table 6 but we add a new
variable for hours worked in the week. To purge the effects of driving intensity from unobserved
demand effects (such as a convention or big event in town), we instrument hours worked in the
week with average hours in previous weeks (which requires us to drop drivers in their first week on
the Uber platform). We estimate a cubic in hours worked using 2SLS in the pay regression. The
graph shows how the driving intensity/earnings changes as we control for different factors.34
In our first specification, we control for “potential experience,” as is typically done, with driver
age and its square.35 The results of this regression suggest an increasing return to work intensity
as hourly earnings increase substantially up to thirty hours per week (which is approximately the
85th percentile of driver weeks) and then flattens out or declines slightly. The upward sloping
relationship between hourly wage and hours worked shows what looks like a long hours premium
for being an Uber driver. But when we control more accurately for relevant experience by adding
our accumulated trips measures, the returns to work intensity turn sharply negative. All else
equal, a driver earns a few percentage points lower hourly wage in the thirtieth hour of driving in
a given week than in the first twenty. This shows that, at least for Uber drivers, there is significant
financial value in accumulated experience and a mildly decreasing return to within-week work
intensity. More generally, it shows that what might appear as a convex hours/pay relationship
when using conventional controls for experience could be masking a return to true experience when
there is no return to work intensity.
Even in this short-term gig economy environment, experience and gender differences in experience play out in a way that contributes substantially to the gender pay gap and is not related
34
In Appendix Figure 10, we show that the pay gap does not vary in an economically meaningful way across
different levels of working intensity. When considering just point estimates, it appears that the gap is marginally
smaller for drivers working more hours per week.
35
Actually, a standard control would be age-education-6 but we do not observe education and do not think it is of
first-order importance for Uber drivers.

28

to work intensity per se. On balance, the relationship between experience and the gender pay gap
for drivers is surprisingly similar to at least some professional job environments and suggests that,
in those settings, it’s possible that the convex hours/earnings relationship is overstated because
on-the-job learning effects cannot be measured accurately. Indeed, distinguishing the difference
between the long hours premium and on-the-job learning in the broader economy is very policy
relevant. Policies that could make jobs more flexible and lower the premium to working long hours
would have little effect on the gender wage gap if a substantial contributor to the correlation of
longer hours and high pay is the omitted variable of experience. While Uber drivers are only a
tiny slice of the broader labor market, they offer a unique lens into these issues since we can both
measure experience and productivity on the job with high precision.
Figure 7: Earnings by driving intensity

Note: This figure graphs the effect on earnings of different values of driving intensity, defined by how often they are
predicted to drive in the week of observation (predicted based on hours driven in past weeks) using a regression of log
hourly earnings on cubic predicted hours worked. Drivers in their first week of work are not included. “Experience bins”
and “where/when” controls are the same as those used throughout the paper. Shaded region represents 95% confidence
interval based on standard errors clustered at the driver-level.

29

3.4

Returns to Speed

As shown in Equation 2.1, drivers earn a per-minute and a per-mile rate on each trip. These rates
may be balanced such that there is a return to speed. If Uber paid only per-minute, earningsmaximizing drivers would drive as slowly as possible (at least until the disutility of the rider anger
exceeds utility from earnings).
The exact returns to speed will depend on market conditions, such as the expected wait time
for a new dispatch. In some unusual circumstances, there are negative returns to speed as the perminute rates can be relatively valuable if the driver expects to wait a long time until getting another
fare. In general, the rates and wait times in our data are such that there is a positive expected
return to driving faster. This return is somewhat higher when driver wait times are shorter. At
extreme speeds, the returns to speed net of costs may turn negative if the risk of a collision or a
speeding ticket becomes high enough.
Given that prior research suggests men are more risk tolerant and aggressive than women (see
Bertrand (2011) and, in the context of driving, Dohmen et al. (2011)) and that Table 3 shows
that male drivers drive faster than women, we now investigate how driver speed affects the gender
earnings gap. We measure speed as distance on trip divided by time on trip in a given driver-hour.
This measure of speed captures both higher driving speed on a given route plus choice of routes that
allow for faster speeds (e.g., highways). Table 8 adds the log of speed as an explanatory variable
to our earlier hourly pay regressions.
Control variables are important in this regression, because higher pay areas and times of week
in Chicago (those areas where there is a more constant stream of fares and where surge is likely
to be higher) are also likely more congested, which lowers speed. The coefficient on log speed in
Column 1 of Table 8 suggests an elasticity of 27% of speed on earnings; a 1% increase in speed
increases earnings by 0.27%. In Column 2, when we control for geohash and hour of week (thus
removing the fact that congestion both lowers speeds and increases earnings), this number increases
to 46%. Column 2 shows that controlling for speed and neighborhood reduces our original 3.6%
gender pay gap all the way to just 1%. Adding the learning-by-doing experience variables to this

30

model fully eliminates the gender pay gap.36
We believe we can describe this speed difference across genders primarily as a difference in
preferences that happens to have a productive value on Uber rather than a response by male
drivers to the incentive to drive faster.37 First, as mentioned above, others have shown that men
are more risk tolerant, both in general and when driving in particular. Second, when we analyze
Uber driver speed as a function of gender, experience, and time/location, we find that men drive
2.2% faster than women.38 Further, speed is only slightly increasing in experience (and experience
does little to close the gender speed gap); if drivers were responding strongly to the incentive
to drive faster, we might expect that their speed increases substantially with experience on the
platform.
In addition, we gathered data from the National Highway Travel Survey a nationally-representative
survey that gathers demographics, vehicle ownership, and “trip diaries” from 150,000 households.
Outside of Uber, there is rarely a pecuniary incentive to drive faster. Despite this, we find that
men still drive faster in the NHTS sample (details in Appendix Table 16). Gender differences in the
preference for speed are a general population phenomenon that have labor market value to drivers.

4

Summarizing the Decomposition

Using standard pay regressions, we have fully explained the gender earnings gap for drivers on
Uber. The raw gap in Chicago of approximately four percent can be attributed to three factors:
male preference for faster driving, time and location choices of drivers, and higher average male
on-the-job experience.
To measure the extent to which each of these factors contributes to the gender pay gap, we
follow the approach described in Gelbach (2016).39 Conceptually, this approach treats each factor
as an “omitted variable” in the relationship between earnings and gender and measures the bias that
36

The estimate in Column 4 is very precise; the gender pay gap has a 95% confidence interval of -0.6% to 0.2%.
Speed is productive in that it generates earnings for both Uber and the driver on any given ride. It also may
generate at least a small long-term value for Uber (and a positive externality on other drivers) because passenger
ratings of drivers are increasing in driver speed, holding other factors constant. This relationship is highly significant
statistically but small in magnitude.

would result if the factor were excluded. This allows us to disentangle the impact on the gender gap
of each factor we controlled for sequentially in the above section, invariant of the order in which we
initially added them into our baseline regression specification. This approach is of particular value
when our observables are correlated; for example, our measure of driving speed is likely endogenous
with where/when a driver works such that the difference in the point estimates of the pay gap with
and without controlling for speed is likely also capturing differences in where/when drivers work.
More precisely, consider a regression of the form

ln(Earningsdt ) = β isM aled + γv Xvdt + γ2 X2dt + d

(4.1)

where Xv is single vector for variable v and X2 captures all remaining variables in our full model
(i.e. speed, experience indicators, time indicators, and location indicators). Now suppose we ignore
information contained in Xv . The resulting omitted variable bias is given by π̂v = Γ̂v γ̂v where Γ̂v
is estimated using an auxiliary regression of gender on Xv .
Dividing our estimate of omitted variable bias by β̂ base , the baseline relationship between earnings and gender conditioning only on calendar week, gives us an estimate of the variable’s contribution to the gender pay gap as a fraction of the baseline, unconditional relationship:

π̃v =

π̂v
β̂ base

(4.2)

These contributions can be aggregated across vectors of variables, such as each of 168 indicators
for hour of week, to obtain the combined contribution of controlling for all hour of week indicators.
We do this for hour of week (when), geohash (where), bins of experience, and speed. These are
correlations and should not be interpreted as the causal effect on the pay gap of, for example,
increasing speed or experience.
Figure 8 presents the parameter estimates of Equation 4.2, along with 95% confidence intervals,
corresponding to a decomposition of the change in point estimates between our baseline model,
which includes only controls for the week of the data (see Column 1, Table 4), and a fully specified
model with controls for speed, location, time of week, and experience (see Column 5, Table 8).

33

Speed alone explains nearly half the gap (48%). Experience can explain the next largest share,
at 36%. Where drivers work can explain a further 28% of the gap, while time of week—once
conditioning out the other factors—actually offsets the pay gap (-7%). This suggests that while
women may choose to drive at different times of the week than men, they do not pay a steep penalty
for this flexibility. The attenuation in the gender pay gap observed when hour of week controls are
included (Table 4) is due to factors, such as experience and driving location, correlated with when
drivers work. Together, these factors fully explain the gender pay gap amongst drivers.40
To further unpack the mechanisms of driver location differences by gender, we remove the
location fixed effects, and replace it with geohash of driver residence fixed effects and controls for
crime rates and liquor licenses in the geohash of pickup. Interestingly, the gender gap also goes
to zero with these location controls, even without the geohash fixed effects. Panel B of Figure 8
repeats the Gelbach decomposition using this new regression. We find 20% of the gender wage
gap can be attributed to differences in where male and female Uber drivers live. As previously
discussed, neighborhoods with a high adult female population share tend to be less lucrative areas,
and since driver location is skewed towards one’s home, women earn less. In addition, womens’
decisions to avoid neighborhoods with high crime and many bars contributes an additional 29% to
the gender wage gap. Even though Uber pay is “gender blind,” if women are disproportionately
unsafe in high crime areas or when riders are less likely to be sober, they pay for it through a
compensating differential.
To further identify the underlying sources of the differences in pay by gender, we return to our
table of averages of all the parameters that enter into driver earnings, as described in Equation
2.1. Table 9 shows the average of each parameter by gender for drivers of three different levels of
experience. All the observations are from a short cross-section so as to control for conditions that
affect earnings.
The table highlights three important themes from our analysis. First, both men and women
learn in a productive manner and at roughly the same rate in terms of number of rides. The wait
times go down by about 5-10% over 1,500 rides of experience. Surge rates improve for both genders
40
The results sum to slightly greater than 100% as the point estimate on isM ale is (insignificantly) negative after
controlling for each of the covariates.

34

and are nearly identical for the two genders. Men have slightly longer pickup distances and ride
distances throughout, but both genders lower pickup distances and increase trip distances in a
similar manner.41
Speed is an outlier in that there is not a clear “improvement” over time for drivers. This is
likely because drivers learn that more congested areas are more lucrative. As per our regressions,
there is a noteworthy (if not huge) difference in speed by gender that is consistent over tenure.
Table 9 captures the important effects of learning. While men and women learn at the same
per-ride rate, the driving schedules of men mean that they learn, on average, more intensively per
week of experience, which generates a gender pay gap. The table also captures that, at all tenures,
men prefer to drive faster.
Finally, we repeat our analyses for UberX/UberPOOL drivers between January 2015 and March
2017 in San Francisco, Boston, Detroit, and Atlanta and Houston.
Table 10 presents results for each of our main specifications in the different cities. The results
tell a similar story: there is a small baseline gender pay gap in each city, which can be explained by
differences in where/when drivers work, different levels of experience, and preferences for driving
speed. In the case of Houston, the pay gap actually reverses once controlling for those three factors
and men make an estimated 1.2% less per hour than women.42 In San Francisco, the baseline gap
is nearly double any other city, at 9.8%, and, even after controlling for all factors, there is a 1.65%
residual wage gap.43
We also conduct a Gelbach decomposition in each city. The results are in Table 10. The
ordering of factors by importance is consistent across cities: speed is the most important factor,
followed by experience, where, and finally when. The magnitudes, however, differ across cities. In
41

The distance differences seem to be related to men having a stronger preference for airport trips, possibly due to
the fact that they work longer shifts and are, therefore, more willing to stray from their base location.
42
The Houston gender gap goes to zero if we add in a control for the distance driven on trip. Houston has many
highways and men appear to take the highway route more often. This is not a big deal in other cities where highways
are less important for short distance travel.
43
The SF gender gap goes to zero if we remove incentive pay from the hourly wage regressions. SF had very large
weekly incentive payments for drivers, where they were offered bonus payments if they completed slightly more trips
than they had completed per week in the prior month. Analyzing these incentive payments at the weekly level also
shows no gender gap once we control for average number of weekly rides given the past month and number of rides
given in the current week.

35

San Francisco, for example, neither when nor where drivers work contribute to an gender wage gap,
while in Detroit both when and where can explain ∼10% of the gap.

Note: This table documents parameter averages from Equation 2.1 by gender and tenure. Data are limited to trips in
Chicago in January-February 2017 to avoid issues with seasonality and changes in composition of driver tenure. Drivers
are bucketed based on their lifetime trips before a given day. Wait time is based on time between becoming available for
a dispatch (e.g., after coming online or completing a previous trip) and accepting and dispatch. Trip distance is based on
actual route taken; however, accepts-to-pickup distance is the Haversine distance between corresponding coordinates.

hour of week, ‘where’ refers to geohashes, ‘experience’ refers to the experience bins described above, and ‘speed’ is the log
average speed on trip for the given hour. All specifications, including the baseline, control for the calendar week. The outcome variable is log of hourly earnings. Observations are at the driver-hour level. For larger cities, regressions are run on
subsets no smaller than 35% so that the full specification is more computationally tractable. Standard errors (in parentheses) clustered at the driver level.

Conclusion

The gig economy has become an increasingly large source of earnings for millions of individuals.
On Uber alone, there are over 3 million active drivers worldwide completing 15 million trips each
day (Bhuiyan (2018)). The growth of flexible work is likely to be especially desirable to women,
and could improve the utility (both those monetary compensation and improved time-use) women
gain from working. However, our study suggests that jobs offering complete flexibility will likely
still contain a gender wage gap, much like the traditional workforce.
Unlike earlier studies, we are able to completely explain the pay gap with three main factors
related to driver preferences and learning: returns to experience, a pay premium for faster driving,
and preferences for where to drive. Indeed, the contribution of the return to experience to gender
earnings gaps has not gotten much attention in previous empirical literature, as it is often quite
difficult to measure in traditional work settings. We find that even tracking the number of weeks
worked—a common proxy for experience in the literature—does not accurately quantify experience,
as men work more hours per week than women and thus accumulate experience more quickly.
Measuring the return to experience is especially important when quantifying the job-flexibility
penalty, as omitting experience from the regression leads to over estates of the job flexibility penalty.
While we fully explain the gender pay gap for Uber drivers, we do not find women to be
disadvantaged by three factors that one might expect to contribute to a gender wage gap: returns
to work intensity, preferences for specific hours, and customer discrimination. Overall, our results
suggest that on-the-job learning may contribute to the gender earnings gap more broadly in the
economy than previously thought. Policies that could target changes in the time-use choices of men
and women could narrow the gender pay gap by helping women move up the learning curve at the
same pace as men.
We have shown that, even in the gender-blind, transactional, flexible environment of the gig
economy, gender-based preferences (especially the value of time not spent at paid work and, for
drivers, preferences for driving speed) can open gender earnings gaps. The preference differences
that contribute to pay differences in professional markets for lawyers and MBA’s also lead to
earnings gaps for drivers on Uber, suggesting they are pervasive across the skill distribution and
39

whether in the traditional or gig workplace.

A.1

Costs of driving

We have been using total earnings for drivers as our primary measure of earnings. But, if costs
differ in a way that is correlated with gender, we could have understated or overstated the gender
“net” pay gap. In some ways, that is not problematic and is consistent with other work. No studies
of the gender gap account for differences in costs of working, though the costs of work vary for
reasons that may well correlate with gender (such as commuting, clothing, and styling). However,
given that a large capital cost is a requirement for independent drivers and that they may deduct
some costs from their taxes, it may be appropriate in their case to consider earnings net of direct
expenses of driving for hire.
The primary costs drivers face are fuel, maintenance, depreciation, and fines for parking or
moving violations. Suppose drivers average 25 cents per mile in costs other than insurance – Uber
covers drivers’ insurance costs while driving. A typical Uber driver covers about 20 miles in one
hour. The driver earns approximately $15.80 net of Uber’s current 25% average share of driver
gross earnings. As a “raw” gender gap, we use the 3.56% from column 2 of Table 4 which controls
only for calendar week. Based on these numbers, men net 56 cents more per hour than women
before expenses. Total average costs per hour—based on 25 cents per mile—would be $5. Men’s
costs would have to be ∼11% higher, in terms of fuel, maintenance, depreciation, and fines to erase
the gender gap.
Many costs, such as fines and maintenance, are not observable. For gasoline, we can estimate
costs by looking at the types of cars men and women drive (although style of driving, including
speeding, will also be a factor in determining fuel efficiency). Men and women may drive cars with
different average fuel efficiency. At a high-level, this appears to be true – of all miles driven by
men in the data, 6.4% of them were in a Toyota Prius compared to only 3.6% of miles driven by
women. Men have, on average, more incentive to invest in more fuel efficient vehicles due to their
longer driving hours. To further test this, we match drivers’ vehicles to fuel economy data from the

44

EPA.44 On average—weighting by miles driven on Uber—women drive cars that get 25.23 miles per
gallon in the city and men drive cars that get 26.80 miles per gallon. Men are getting about 6.4%
more miles per gallon on average; controlling for gasoline costs would likely increase the gender pay
gap.
Another cost to consider is insurance. Though insurance is a large cost for drivers, Uber pays
drivers’ insurance when they are working. The costs of insurance are relevant, however, as a proxy
for accidents (and the downtime that goes with them) and tickets. Men pay more than women for
car insurance, though the rates converge at age 26. Accident rates per mile driven are higher for
young men than young women but the difference narrows or disappears around age 25. Fatality
rates remain higher for men.45 However, given the insurance rates converge, it seems that the total
costs of dangerous driving are about the same by gender after age 25. This suggests that accidents
and fines should only vary by gender for drivers under 26. In our sample of Chicago drivers, 15.8%
of female drivers and 14.8% of male drivers are under 26. So our gender gap estimates should not
be affected by these costs for the vast majority of our sample.
Overall, we cannot estimate differences in costs by gender nearly as precisely as we can estimate
gender differences in earnings. However, we also do not see any evidence that the gender pay
differences are offset by cost differences.

Features of driving location
Data construction

Crime data are provided by the Chicago Data Portal and encompass all reported crimes during
our time sample, January 2015 to March 2017. To proxy for the relative safety of a geohash,
we measure the number of crimes that occur during our time sample in that geohash per 1,000
residents. We restrict crime data to non-residential crimes; residential crimes, such as domestic
44

Fuel economy data are available at the level of the vehicle make, model, year, and trim. Drivers manually enter
these fields on sign-up; there are often typos or abbreviations (e.g., “s-class” instead of the exact model). We fuzzymatch based on the Levenshtein distance between the Uber model and the EPA data’s model. Results are based
only on matches with a Levenstein distance over 0.7 (about 70% of the data). Results are qualitatively similar for
different Levenshtein distance thresholds.

violence, are unlikely to be relevant for a driver’s sense of safety. The most frequent crimes in the
data are theft, battery, and criminal damage.
Population and demographics data come from the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS).
The ACS data are at the census tract level; to map to geohashes, we look at all census tracts that
intersect a given geohash and assume that the population is uniformly distributed across the census
tract such that, if half of a census tract is in a given geohash, we assign half of its population to that
geohash. Demographics such as median household income are based on the population-weighted
average of all census tracts that intersect a given geohash.
Driver home addresses are based on the address associated with a driver’s bank account, which
we believe to be more likely up-to-date than the address on their license. We map these addresses to
geohashes. For both census population numbers and driver home locations, we smooth the features
by measuring the number of drivers (or general population) living in geohashes within one mile of
the given geohash.
Finally, we use data on business licenses from the Chicago Data Portal to find number of unique
locales with an active liquor license. Bar districts may be differentially unsafe for women, especially
during late night hours. In total, there are 3,877 businesses with a liquor license.
Because some of the neighborhood variables we analyze change substantially over small distances
and because we are doing the analysis at the geohash level (rather than the driver-hour level), we
use finer geohashes for this analysis than we use in our driver pay regressions. Specifically, in this
section, we use precision six geohashes; each geohash side is approximately 0.75 miles long. In
addition to limiting to the City of Chicago geography, we further limit to geohashes with over 1,000
trips. There are 1,014 geohashes in the resulting data (compared to the fifty larger geohashes we
use in the pay regressions), covering 68.9% of our total trips.

A.2.2

Determinants of driving location

To more formally estimate how features of a location relate to male and female drivers propensity
to drive there, we regress the difference in log share of trips for men and women against these

46

features. That is, for quantity of trips Q completed by women (w) and men (m) in geohash g ∈ G,
the set of all geohashes, we regress

Returns to experience

The returns to experience we document could be driven by selection bias – for example, perhaps
drivers with lower earnings drop off the platform and those that reach the higher tenure bins had
always been earning more per hour. To test this, we add driver fixed effects to our model. Results
are presented in table 14. Adding driver fixed effects attenuates the learning curve by about ∼30%
with time and location controls and ∼35% with only controls for the calendar week.
There are other forms of selection bias that could affect how we measure the returns to experience. For example, perhaps drivers construct an expectation of future earnings growth and drop
off the platform if the do not expect to continue learning.

Survey; even in contexts where there is no pecuniary incentive to drive faster, men still do so.

Note: The table presents estimates the gender gap in log driving speed using data from the National Household Travel Survey. Dependent variable is average miles per hour driven on a single trip. Column 3 includes controls for household income
bins, driver education bins, dummies for why the trip was taken, dummies for why the previous trip was taken, day of the
week, hour of day, age dummies, MSA size bins, and whether the interstate was used on trip. Column 4 add individual vehicle fixed effects. Since each household only record trips on a single day, Column 4 only compares male and female speeds
driven in the same vehicle on the same day. Standard errors in parentheses.
