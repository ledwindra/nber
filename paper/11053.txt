Market Distortions when Agents are Better Informed: The Value of Information in Real Estate
Transactions
Steven D. Levitt and Chad Syverson
NBER Working Paper No. 11053
January 2005
JEL No. D8, L1, L8, R2, R3
ABSTRACT
Agents are often better informed than the clients who hire them and may exploit this informational
advantage. Real-estate agents, who know much more about the housing market than the typical
homeowner, are one example. Because real estate agents receive only a small share of the
incremental profit when a house sells for a higher value, there is an incentive for them to convince
their clients to sell their houses too cheaply and too quickly. We test these predictions by comparing
home sales in which real estate agents are hired by others to sell a home to instances in which a real
estate agent sells his or her own home. In the former case, the agent has distorted incentives; in the
latter case, the agent wants to pursue the first-best. Consistent with the theory, we find homes owned
by real estate agents sell for about 3.7 percent more than other houses and stay on the market about
9.5 days longer, even after controlling for a wide range of housing characteristics. Situations in
which the agent's informational advantage is larger lead to even greater distortions.

I. Introduction
Because of specialization, individuals rely heavily on the advice of experts in making
decisions. For activities as varied as medical treatment, repairing a car, legal advice, planning for
retirement, or selling a home (to name just a few), there are experts with particular skills,
knowledge, and experience willing to provide their services.
A defining characteristic of transactions involving the hiring of an expert is the
informational advantage enjoyed by the expert relative to the client seeking advice. As a result of
this private information, expert agents may mislead their clients by exaggerating the costs or
difficulty of a solution, providing unneeded services, or otherwise distorting the information to
maximize the expert’s own payoff. For example, a lawyer may argue that his services are
necessary in preparing a simple will, even though the lawyer would use the same off-the-shelf
software a client could buy. A car mechanic may suggest overhauling the entire engine when
only a small part needs replacing. A travel agent may only mention flights on airlines which pay
the highest commission rates to travel agents for booking.
In this paper, we focus on the relationship between a real estate agent and a home seller.
The real estate agent is likely better informed about the value of the house and the state of the
local housing market than is the seller. Because of the particular form of residential real estate
contracts, the real estate agent receives only a small fraction of the purchase price of a home, but
bears much of the cost of selling the house (e.g. expenditures on advertising and marketing,
showing the home to prospective buyers, and hosting open houses), inducing a misalignment of
incentives between the seller and agent.1 The agent has strong incentives to sell a house quickly,
even at a substantially lower price, and thus may encourage clients to accept sub-optimally low
offers too quickly. As in Crawford and Sobel (1982), the homeowner may rationally follow this
advice, despite being fully cognizant of the agent’s desire to mislead because the incentives of the

An interesting question, to which we turn in Section VI, is why the existing contractual arrangements
persist in light of this distortion.
1

home seller and the agent are well-enough aligned that on net the home seller can benefit from
the agent’s superior information, although in some instances the agent will distort information in
a way that hurts the home seller.
Real estate transactions provide an unusually attractive setting to test the impact of
information distortion by experts. Unlike many experts (e.g. surgeons), real estate agents not
only provide their services to clients, but also sell their own homes. When a real estate agent sells
his own home, he is residual claimant on the full surplus from the sale and thus has optimal
incentives. By comparing sale prices and time on the market for homes in which the agent is
hired by a client versus when the agent sells his or her own home (and controlling for other
factors), we have a simple test of the distortions induced by the private information of experts.
Our paper builds on a small empirical literature in this area. Hubbard (1998, 2002)
analyzes data from the California vehicle inspection emission market and finds that inspection
suppliers tend to let vehicles pass inspections, even though they would incur a short-run benefit
from repairing those that fail—the reason being that lenient inspections are rewarded with repeat
business. Gruber and Owings (1996) provide tantalizing evidence of how physicians may distort
decisions to further their own interests. Doctors in areas with declining birth rates are found to be
much more likely to perform caesarian sections than are doctors in growing areas. Gruber and
Owings interpret this result as possible evidence that excess capacity leads doctors to induce
demand for more expensive services from their clients. The research most similar to our work is
Munneke and Yavas (1997), which compares sales brokered by RE/MAX real estate agents to
those of other real estate agents. At RE/MAX, agents pay a fixed fee and keep the full
commission, as opposed to splitting the commission with the agency. In their model, however,
they do not focus on the information problem we consider, and indeed predict (and find) no
difference in prices and time on the market for RE/MAX agents versus others (although their data

2

set is small, giving the tests low power). In addition, agents working for RE/MAX are likely to
be a highly selected sample of the most productive agents.2
Using a data set of nearly 100,000 home sales, of which roughly 3,300 are agent-owned,
we find that agent-owned homes sell for about 3.7 percent (or roughly $7700 at the median sales
price) more than comparable houses and stay on the market an extra 9.5 days (about 10 percent)
longer, even after controlling for a wide array of house and neighborhood characteristics.
Agent-induced distortions are largest when agents enjoy the greatest informational
advantage, providing further evidence in favor of the theory. We examine three different
dimensions along which the agent’s advantage might vary. First, we stratify the sample as a
function of how heterogeneous the housing stock is on a particular city block. Greater
heterogeneity is likely to increase the agent’s informational advantage by reducing the availability
to the non-agent homeowner of directly comparable prior home sales. We find that on houses on
blocks in the upper-third of our sample in terms of heterogeneity, agents get 4.3 percent more for
their houses and stay on the market an extra 9.5 days. In contrast, in the third of the sample
where houses on the block are most alike, agents obtain only 2.3 percent more for their houses
and time on the market is not significantly different. Second, the rise of the internet has made it
much easier for sellers to directly observe the characteristics of other houses on the market and to
find recent transaction prices, reducing the informational advantage or realtors. Consistent with
the theory, in the period 1992-1995, observationally equivalent agent homes sold for 4.9 percent
more than those of their clients and stayed on the market over two weeks longer. From 20002002, in contrast, agents obtained only 2.9 percent more for their houses and stayed on the market
2.5 days longer. Finally, in the case where the buyer is not represented by a realtor, the seller’s
realtor may have a greater ability to determine the sale price. We find that the absence of a
buyer’s agent has no impact on the sale price of client homes, but is associated with a 1.7 percent2

Germaise and Moskowitz (2004) analyze a different type of information asymmetry in commercial real
estate transactions. Our results also contribute to a growing literature (e.g. Genesove and Mayer 1997,

3

higher sale price when the realtor sells his own house. This finding suggests that the realtor
successfully exploits uninformed buyers when selling his or her own house, but does not reap the
available gain for clients (perhaps because tough bargaining might jeopardize a deal being
reached).
All of the empirical findings are consistent with agents distorting information to mislead
clients, but are difficult to reconcile with most other plausible theories. If realtor homes are more
attractive to buyers on unobservable dimensions (e.g., realtors know better what features the
market values or invest more in maintenance of their houses), the higher house price can be
explained, but the longer time on the market is puzzling. Likewise, if agents exert less effort in
selling their clients’ houses than their own (the typical principal-agent story), agents would sell
their houses for higher prices, but should sell their own homes more quickly, contrary to the
evidence. Another possible explanation—agents having systematically lower discount rates than
typical home sellers—would reproduce our most basic results qualitatively, but is insufficient to
explain either the size of the differences (a 140 percent annual discount rate would be necessary
to match the data) or why the distortions are greatest when the informational advantage is most
extreme.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II discusses the theory underlying the
paper’s empirical analysis. Section III introduces the data used. Sections IV and V present the
empirical analysis, and Section VI discusses the results and concludes.

II. The Underlying Theory
Our analysis of the relationship between a real estate agent and a home seller is
predicated on the idea that the realtor has better information about the local real estate market
than the home seller. The home seller would like to truthfully elicit the realtor’s private

information, but it is neither observable nor verifiable to a third party. The standard contractual
form in residential real estate involves the realtor paying much of the marginal cost of marketing
the home, but receiving only a small fraction of the marginal proceeds of the sale. Thus, the
realtor is willing to accept a lower price for the house than the homeowner in order to sell more
quickly. A rational homeowner will take the agent’s distorted incentives into account and
discount appropriately the agent’s advice regarding whether a particular offer should be accepted
or rejected. Nonetheless, as we formally derived in an earlier version of this paper (Levitt and
Syverson 2002), if the agent is sufficiently better informed, the agent’s optimal strategy is to
advise the homeowner to accept any offer that is in the best interest of the agent to accept, and the
homeowner will follow the agent’s advice. 3 Just as in Crawford and Sobel (1982), despite the
fact the homeowner knows the agent’s recommendation is distorted, the best the poorly informed
homeowner can do is to follow the advice.4 Thus, the primary predictions of the theory are that
(1) for two identical houses, one owned by a real estate agent and the other owned by a client of
the real estate agent, the real estate agent’s home will stay on the market for a longer period of
time and sell for a higher price, and (2) the greater the informational advantage of the real estate
agent, the larger these two differences will be.

3

Note that in this setup, the agent cannot credibly convey any information beyond a simple
recommendation to either accept or reject the offer. Any message that attempted to further signal the
intensity of the agent’s preferences is cheap talk. For any offer that is high enough that the agent would
like the seller to accept, the agent will have the incentive to falsely portray the offer as being extremely
high, even if it is just above the acceptability cutoff. As consequence, the seller will ignore such
information (Crawford and Sobel 1982). If we were to allow cash transfers from the agent to the seller, this
would provide a means for the agent to convey more information about the attractiveness of the offer.
When a really good offer arrives, the agent could credibly signal this by offering to make an additional
payment to the seller if the offer is accepted.
4

Since Crawford and Sobel (1982), a rich theoretical literature has developed that analyzes strategic
information transmission. Theory that is particularly relevant to our analysis includes recent work on the
role of experts by Taylor (1995), Levy (2000), and Krishna and Morgan (2001). For surveys of the broader
literature, see Kennan and Wilson (1991) and Riley (2001). There is also a great deal of work addressing
how contracts are structured to encourage agents to exert the optimal amount of effort (e.g., Grossman and
Hart 1983, Sappington 1991). Prendergast (2002) argues that the empirical evidence supporting the
hypothesized tradeoff between risk and effort is tenuous.

5

The extent of the distortion induced by misaligned agent incentives may be considerable.
Real estate agents typically bear a substantial fraction of the marketing costs involved with a
home sale: advertising, accompanying potential buyers on visits to the home, conducting open
houses, and negotiating offers. Typically, however, the agent receives only about 1.5 percent of
each marginal dollar of the price for which the house sells. (The total share of the sale price that
goes to agents is usually 6 percent, split evenly between the buyer’s and seller’s agents. Of the
selling agent’s 3 percent, roughly half goes to the agent’s firm, leaving 1.5 percent for the agent.)
If the combined financial and opportunity cost to the agent of selling a house were $200 per
week, then the agent would be indifferent between selling the house today and waiting one more
week and receiving an offer $13,333 higher with certainty. The homeowner, on the other hand,
would much prefer to wait a week and take the higher offer. On a $300,000 house, the
homeowner’s one week return from waiting would be over four percent. Another way of putting
into perspective just how distorted are the agent’s incentives is to compare real estate to
sharecropping, where some have argued that the contractual form leads to important distortions
(e.g. Shaban 1987). In the typical sharecropping arrangement, the output is split 50-50 between
the land owner and the sharecropper; in real estate, the seller’s agent receives only 1.5 percent of
the profit on the margin. Furthermore, most sharecropping arrangements involve a repeated
game, whereas home sales are often one-shot deals.

III. Data Used in the Analysis
The data we use encompass nearly 100,000 home sales in suburban Cook County,
Illinois. The source of the data is the Multiple Listing Service of Northern Illinois (MLSNI), the
clearinghouse through which realtors in the Chicago metropolitan area notify other realtors (and,
more recently, the public) of properties for sale.5 These data have numerous strengths. First, they

are not publicly available, but can be obtained by any licensed realtor who is part of MLSNI.

cover virtually every house put up for sale in which a seller’s agent is hired, regardless of whether
the house is eventually sold. Most of the analysis presented below focuses on homes that actually
sell, but we are also able to explore whether or not listed homes sell as a check on possible
selection biases. Second, the data contain extremely detailed information about every house on
the market, including the address, a wide range of housing characteristics, the list price and sale
price of the home, a written description of the house’s attributes used by the real estate agent in
marketing the house, and the key dates regarding the home sale (e.g., when the house goes on the
market, the date a contract is signed with a buyer, etc.). Third, the data report whether the real
estate agent has an ownership interest in the house, which is critical to our identification strategy.
The MLSNI data do, however, have a number of important flaws and limitations. First,
the dataset does not provide any information about homes that are for-sale-by-owner (FSBO).
Second, the information in the database is entered by the real estate agents themselves. There is
no independent check on the accuracy of the description of the home’s attributes.6 Also, there are
few restrictions on what agents can type into a field in the data base and no requirement that all
fields be completed. As a consequence, there are substantial amounts of missing data for some
variables (e.g. approximate square footage), some evidence of obvious errors, and a lack of
uniformity in the way fields are coded.7
Our primary sample is made up of sales of single-family homes that were listed for sale
during the period 1992-2002 in 34 Cook County suburbs. These suburbs are the 34 largest
Chicago suburbs in which the majority of properties listed for sale are detached single family
homes and in which sales of newly constructed homes represent a small fraction of overall sales.

6

For some entries such as listing prices and addresses, there are strong incentives for the agent to enter the
correct numbers, since this database is the primary mechanism through which other agents learn what
properties are currently for sale.

7

For instance, we observe over fifty different entries for the field asking the presence or absence of “air
conditioning,” corresponding to different conventions for abbreviating responses and different types of
systems such as wall units, central air, zoned central air, space-pacs, or a combination thereof.

7

We impose a number of restrictions on the data. We use county tax identification
numbers to link listing and sales activity on a given property over time. Properties that are
missing tax identification numbers, or have errors in these numbers (for instance, two properties
listing the same tax ID number but located in different cities) are dropped from the sample. Any
home that sells twice within a three-year period is dropped from the sample due to concerns that
the house has been purchased and rehabbed for resale. In the presence of imperfect measures of a
house’s quality, these repeat transactions may yield particularly misleading results, especially if
real estate agents are more likely to be rehabbers than other sellers.8 After these initial
exclusions, we are left with listings for just under 127,000 homes. About 22 percent of these
homes are withdrawn from the market before a sale ever occurs. We eliminate a small number of
properties with either very low or high listing prices or sale prices (less than $50,000, more than
$3,000,000, or a price more than five times the median value in that city), and properties with
suspicious entries such as those reporting no bathrooms, no kitchen, etc. Finally, in order to
estimate all models with a common sample, about 450 listings are removed due to missing data
for one or more of the variables included in the hedonic model. This leaves us a final data set
with roughly 98,000 home sales. About 3.4 percent of the observations in our data—3330
sales—involve a real estate agent selling his or her own home.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for the data set. The first two columns report the
mean and standard deviation of key variables over the entire sample. Columns (3)-(5) show a set
of three statistics regarding data variations within city-year cells. Column (3) contains the
standard deviations of the variables’ within-city-year components; that is, the standard deviation
of the residual when the variable is regressed on a set of city-year dummies. Column (4) shows
differences between the means of the agent-owned and non-agent-owned home sales within each
city-year, and (5) reports the p-value of a test for equality of the means. Columns (6)-(8) report
8

A rehabber can get better access to properties and can collect commissions on the property transactions
business by becoming a real estate agent. Thus most rehabbers are likely to also have real estate licenses.

8

data that parallels the information in columns (3)-(5), but presents within-block, rather than cityyear comparisons.
The second through fourth rows of the table contain our primary variables of interest: sale
price (in levels and logs) and time on the market. Consistent with the prediction of the model,
even on a given block, agent-as-seller homes sell for substantially more ($48,445 on average, or
18 percent of the mean sales price9) and conditional on a sale occurring, remain on the market for
almost 15 days longer than other homes. In results not reported here, we also find that a slightly
smaller fraction of the agent-owned homes that are put on the market are eventually sold. This
reinforces the fact that agent-owned homes take longer to sell. If one computes the average
number of days on the market per home sale, including properties that never sell in the numerator,
agent-owned houses are on the market 135 days per sale, compared to only 111 for non-agentowned houses, or 22 percent longer. It is clear from the remainder of the table, however, that the
attributes and locations of homes owned by agents are systematically different from the nonagent-owned homes. Real estate agents tend to live in homes that are larger, newer, and have
greater numbers of amenities like master baths and fireplaces, even compared to other homes on
the same block. These systematic differences in housing characteristics highlight the importance
of controls in the analysis we carry out. Although we have an extremely rich set of covariates,
the possibility remains that realtor-owned properties might be correlated with unobservable
characteristics of the housing.

IV. Core Empirical Estimates
The empirical specification we estimate to predict sale prices and time-on-market that is
most fully saturated takes the following form:
It is worth noting, however, that our empirical results are not sensitive to excluding repeat sales.
9

The skewness of the house price distribution may exaggerate the size of a typical difference. The mean
difference in logged sales prices—the primary difference we focus on below—suggests a 12-percent
difference in average sales prices.

9

y hta = β * AGENT _ OWNEDht + X ht γ + κ ct + λb + ε ht ,
where h, t, c, and b correspond respectively to house, year, city, and city block. The dependent
variable y is either a house’s logged sales price or days on the market. 10 The full set of housing
characteristics listed in Table 1 are included in Xht. In addition, we allow for city-specific
variation in annual prices (κct), and fixed-effects for each city block (λb).
Table 2 presents a series of regression results in which the set of control variables is
expanded as one moves from left to right. The logged sales price coefficients on agent-owned
houses are presented in the top row of numbers, and the corresponding coefficients for days on
the market are shown in a lower row. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors are in
parentheses. In addition, the bottom row of the table reports the “informational rents” accruing to
the realtor, computed as the additional sale price they receive minus the cost of waiting longer to
sell. We use an annual discount rate of 20 percent in these calculations – a number that is high,
but consistent with the previous research of Genesove and Mayer (1997).
Column (1) includes fixed effects for each city-year pair as well as controls for the subset
of our observed housing characteristics that reflect the scale of the house (e.g., number of
bedrooms, number of bathrooms, how many cars the garage can hold). Controlling for the scale
of the house substantially reduces the estimated impact of agent ownership from the simple
within-city mean differences in Table 1. The sales price difference between agent-owned and
non-agent-owned homes is 4.8 percent, almost two-thirds less than the within-city difference
obtained before conditioning on scale. Thus the fact that agents live in their cities’ larger-thanaverage homes, as seen before in Table 1, is in part responsible for the observed differences in
10

We have also run other specification variations in the same spirit as the sales price and time-on-market
regressions reported here. One variant used homes’ original list prices as the dependent variable, since it is
possible that agents’ information advantage also impacts the way listing prices are set. The other variant
estimated a sales hazard model on the probability a particular home sells as a function of observables. This
allowed us to directly account for the fact that certain listing episodes are truncated (i.e., pulled off the
market) before a sale is ever made. We found in both cases very similar results—qualitatively and
quantitatively—to those reported below. Agent-owned homes are put on the market at higher prices than
non-agent-owned homes and have longer expected times-to-sale.

10

sales prices and time on the market. The difference in time on the market is about 17 days, onethird less than the unconditional value in Table 1. Adjusting for the longer time on the market,
realtors achieve an extra return of 3.9 percent on their houses. The coefficients on the control
variables (which are shown for the complete hedonic specification in Table 3) indicate that as
expected, more is better.
A particular concern in testing the hypotheses of the model is that agents live in houses
that are especially attractive along dimensions that are difficult for us to observe or quantify. For
instance, agents may have good taste, take better care of their houses, or live in houses that have
more features desired by potential home buyers (e.g., master bedroom suites, modern kitchens,
and so on). Columns (2) and (3) of Table 2 attempt to control for possible differences in quality
in two ways.
In column (2), a wide range of housing characteristics are added such as the a variable for
the presence of a master bathroom, the number of fireplaces, the presence of air conditioning, the
house’s age (category), the exterior material (brick, stucco, etc.), and the style of the house
(colonial, bungalow, etc.). We also control for the listing agent’s total number of sales as a proxy
for reputation and experience effects. When these controls are added, the agent-owned
coefficient in the sale price equation drops slightly, from 0.048 to 0.042, while the estimated
difference in days on the market falls from 16.89 to 11.03. Because the gap in time on the market
shrinks between column 1 and column 2, the implied informational rents accruing to agent-owned
homes falls only half as much as the magnitude of the sale-price gap (i.e. from 3.9 percent to 3.6
percent).
In column (3), we add dummy variables for a large set of keywords and phrases used in
the written marketing description of the house. When these descriptors are added, neither
coefficient changes by more than 10 percent. Further, this is despite the fact that many
descriptors enter into the regression significantly, as indicated in Table 3. Systematic quality
differences appear to be responsible for part of the gap between agent-owned and non-agent-

11

owned homes sales prices and times-on-market (although most of the difference is explained by
broad indicators of age and style rather than by more subtle characteristics picked up by the
agents’ descriptions).
A way to further remove possible biases due to unobservables is to include block fixed
effects, so that identification of the parameters comes from a comparison of sale prices of
different homes on the same block, rather than from homes in different areas of a city. Homes on
the same block are nearly identical in terms of school quality, crime, proximity to public
transportation and parks, etc. As demonstrated in column (4), the R2 of the regressions—and
particularly those for time-on-market—jump noticeably when block affects are added, suggesting
the presence of important differences across blocks within a city. The estimated sales price and
time-on-market impacts of a home being agent-owned, however, see only small and statistically
insignificant drops with the inclusion of block fixed effects. The implied price gap between
agent-owned and non-agent-owned home sales is 3.7 percent, with agent-owned homes staying
on the market 9.5 days longer.
The results of Table 2 suggest that the primary dimension along which agent-owned
houses differ from other homes is in terms of scale and readily identifiable amenities such as
master baths. Controlling for these factors in Column 1 dramatically lowers the gaps between
agent-owned and other houses, relative to the means of the raw data. Including a wide range of
other controls, however, accounts for much of the residual variance in sale prices, but has a
relatively small impact on the impact of agent-ownership.11

11

We have explored two further approaches for quantifying the extent to which remaining
unobservables might be biasing our estimates. Following the methodology of Murphy and Topel
(1990), under the assumption that variation in our outcome variables that we cannot explain is
related to our agent-owned variable in the same way as the variation that we can explain, we can
estimate the true coefficients, even if some bias due to unobservables remains in our
specifications. Moving from column 2 to column 4 of Table 2, the sale price coefficient falls
from 4.2 percent to 3.7 percent as the R-squared of the regression rises from .886 to .958.
Extending that trend over the remaining unexplained variation yields an estimate of 3.4 percent
on the agent-owned variable in the sale price regression. The time on the market results, because
the R-squared is lower, are slightly more sensitive, yielding an estimated true underlying
12

The estimated realtor-owned-home coefficient has a plausible magnitude. A 3.7-percent
divergence in sales price for the median-priced home in our sample ($208,000) implies a $7700
higher sales price for an equivalent agent-owned home. The additional time on the market spent
by agent-owned homes is roughly 10 percent of the average listing time. The time-on-market
results suggest a partial explanation for Genesove and Mayer’s (1997) interesting finding that
home sellers in their sample have a high implied discount rate. If our analysis is correct, sellers
sell too quickly not only because of impatience, but also because agents “trick” them into doing
so.
It is not the case that extra money received by realtors can be explained as fair
compensation for waiting longer to sell their house; a 3.7 percent higher sale price in return for a
waiting an additional 9.5 days implies a 140 percent annual discount rate.12 Even if one uses an
extremely high annual discount rate of 20 percent (but one that is consistent with the behavior of
home sellers in Genesove and Mayer 1997), then adjusting for the longer time on the market,
agent houses sell for the equivalent of 3.2 percent more than the homes of their clients, as shown
in the bottom row of Table 2. This represents a crude estimate of the value of the agent’s
informational advantage, although it will be upwardly biased if agents invest more effort or make
a greater financial investment when selling their own homes, as a standard principal-agent model
would suggest.
Our results are not easily reconciled with either a model in which realtor houses are more
attractive on unobservable dimensions such as good taste in choices of décor by realtors, or by the
standard principal-agent model in which realtors exert more effort when selling their own homes.
In both models, one would expect realtor homes to sell more quickly, not more slowly. Our
coefficient of 5.7 extra days on the market, compared to our estimate of 9.5 days. A second
approach to eliminating unobservables is the inclusion of agent-fixed effects in the specification.
With agent-fixed effects, the coefficient on the agent-owned variable in the sale price regression
is 2.9 percent (standard error of 0.3 percent) and in the time on the market regression the
coefficient is 6.5 days (standard error of 2.3 days).

If (1 + r/365)9.5 = 1.037, then r = 1.398.

13

results, at least in principle, could be a consequence of realtors selling their own homes being less
risk averse than their clients or having systematically lower discount rates. We see little reason
why realtors should be less risk averse than the typical seller, especially since shocks to housing
prices will affect their wealth both via their labor income and the price they could receive for
their home. With respect to discount rates, the enormous difference in discount rates required to
explain our results make this explanation an unlikely one as well. In addition, neither a risk
aversion story nor a discount rate story can explain why, as we demonstrate below, the patterns
we observe systematically vary with the extent of the agent’s informational advantage.
Table 3 reports the full set of parameters for the control variables included in the
regression with block fixed effects. While these are not the primary focus of our analysis, it is
reassuring that the coefficients on these characteristics are sensible. For example, all else
constant, a house with four bedrooms sells for 6.1 percent more than one with three bedrooms,
going from 1.5 to 2.0 baths is worth 1.4 percent, central air is worth 6.8 percent relative to no air
conditioning, brick houses sell for an 3.6 percent premium over those with siding, and colonials
sell for 8.5 percent more than otherwise identical ranch-style home.
The coefficients on the words used in the written descriptions of the properties are also of
some interest. Words that indicate obvious problems with a house, such as “foreclosure,” “as-is,”
“handyman special,” etc. are associated with substantially lower sale prices.13 Words that
correspond to well-defined and desirable attributes of the house that are not otherwise
communicated in the property listing, e.g. “granite,” “maple,” “gourmet,” etc., are related to
higher sale prices. Among the words that have zero or even negative correlations with prices are
some that are superficially positive, but in effect damn with faint praise (like “clean,” “quiet,” and
“youthful”); words and phrases that do not describe particular characteristics of the house (e.g.,
13

Our basic findings regarding agent-owned homes are robust to excluding these problem properties. If we
drop any property that has one of the keywords that might indicate a property in unusual disrepair (there are
a total of 15,232 such homes in our sample), the estimate on the agent-owner dummy in the sales price

14

“fantastic,” “charming,” and “!”); and those that characterize features of the house already
covered by other information available in the listing sheet (e.g. “spacious”).

V. How Do Outcomes Vary with the Extent of the Agent’s Informational Advantage?
Further evidence that the explanation of our findings rests on the agent’s informational
advantage comes from an analysis of subsets of the data across which that advantage is likely to
systematically vary. We examine this issue along three different dimensions, reporting the results
in Table 4.
The first dimension we analyze is the degree of heterogeneity in the housing stock on the
city block where the home is located. In areas with nearly identical homes, sellers can learn
much about their own homes’ values simply by noting nearby sales prices. When housing stock
in an area is very heterogeneous, however, other sales prices convey less information to sellers
about their homes’ values. We proxy heterogeneity by constructing a Herfindahl index of home
styles among houses sold on the block in our sample period. (That is, we sum the squared shares
of each housing style on the block.) In order to be included in the analysis, we require at least 3
homes to be sold on the block. Houses are classified into 21 different styles (e.g., ranch, colonial,
American four square, prairie, contemporary) using the descriptions in the MLS listing. We then
divide blocks into three equally sized groups according to the Herfindahl measure. The
coefficient estimates of the impact of an agent-owned home are reported in the panel A of Table
4. In addition, we also report the implied informational advantage of the realtor, where we have
adjusted the agent-owner price gap for differences in time on the market using an annual discount
rate of 20 percent.
As can be seen in the table, the sales price difference between agent-owned homes and
other homes is indeed highest on blocks where the houses are most different. Here, the price
regression is 0.036 (0.003), essentially the same as that for the full sample. The coefficient in the time-onmarket regression is 9.20 (2.44), also very close to the full-sample result.

15

difference is 4.3 percent. The gap is smaller in the moderate-heterogeneity blocks (3.9 percent),
and smaller still on the low-heterogeneity blocks (2.3 percent—roughly half that of the most
dissimilar blocks), all in accordance with the notion that neighborhoods with dissimilar houses
present a larger information advantage for realtors. The time on the market differences reflect
similar contrasts (though the point estimate is slightly higher for the moderate-heterogeneity
blocks than it is for the high-heterogeneity blocks). Agents on the more heterogeneous blocks
clearly keep their houses on the market for a longer period than non-agents, while there is no
statistically significant time-to-sale gap on those blocks with the most similar houses. Finally, the
sizes of agents’ implied information advantage in the three sub-samples are in accordance with
expectations: it is largest for the most dissimilar blocks but gets progressively smaller as
heterogeneity falls.14
The second dimension along which we expect to see systematic differences in agents’
information advantage relates to the introduction of the internet. In recent years information
about house sale prices have become readily available to the general public on the Chicago
Tribune website. In addition, sellers can now directly access a limited version of the MLS. There
are also web-based services that will predict the market value of a home based on econometric
models (e.g. Case and Shiller 1990) and information the seller enters into the program. Because
of the improved information dissemination, we expect that the information advantage of realtors
has fallen over time. We report in panel B of Table 4 the results from estimating our full hedonic
specification on three sub-samples of the data stratified by time period (1992-1995, 1996-1999,
and 2000-2002).

14

We have also attempted to measure heterogeneity of housing based upon the measured heterogeneity in
the overall observable characteristics of homes sold on the block. To obtain that block-level measure of
house heterogeneity, we first regress logged sales prices on a set of city-year dummies and block effects.
The residuals from this regression are that portion of home sales prices not driven by temporal or spatial
differences in average price levels. These residuals therefore embody between-home differences in
observable characteristics, such as the number of rooms, the age of the home, and so on. We use the
average squared residual on each block as our measure of block heterogeneity. The results are similar to
those obtained using the Herfindahl index based on housing styles.

16

As expected, the largest average sales price difference between agent-owned and nonagent-owned homes—4.9 percent—is in the earliest period. This falls by about one-third, to 3.2
percent, during 1996-1999 (where the internet is starting to widely diffuse), and drops again
slightly after 1999. The time-on-market differences echo these patterns; agent-owners wait more
than two weeks longer before 1996, just over a week longer in the middle period, and two-and-ahalf days longer in 2000-2002. The implied information advantages, shown in the final column,
again reflect that agents were more able to act opportunistically in the earlier part of the sample.
The information gap is roughly 50 percent higher than in the latter parts of the sample, although
indistinguishable between the middle and the end of the sample.
The third dimension along which the informational advantage may vary is with respect to
the presence of a buyer’s agent. In most transactions, the sellers and buyers are represented by
different agents. In some transactions, only the seller has an agent, or the same agent represents
both the seller and the buyer. There are three channels through which the absence of an
independent agent representing the buyer could enhance the information advantage of the seller’s
realtor. First, the selling agent would communicate directly with potential home buyers,
providing an additional channel through which to affect outcomes (perhaps without the seller’s
complete knowledge). If a buyer has a realtor, on the other hand, the two realtors talk to each
other instead of the opposing clients. Second, a buyer’s agent is likely to be better informed than
the clients he or she represents. While the incentives of buyers and their agents are not perfectly
aligned (buyers’ realtors prefer to have deals go through, even if buyers overpay), buyers’ agents
are nonetheless acting on behalf of buyers and may credibly contradict statements by the selling
agents about the current state of the market. Third, and perhaps most importantly, when buyers
do not have agents, the selling realtor’s commissions double since fees do not have to be split
with a buyer’s agent. Therefore selling agents have strong incentives to sell to buyers without
agents; when realtors sell their own homes, however, the incremental gain of 1.5 percent from

17

making a sale with no buyer’s agent is only a small portion of the total value of the house. The
cost to a realtor of
To test these hypotheses, we re-run our basic specification for the sales price of the home,
but add two indicator variables to the specification (as well as interacting these indicators with the
agent-owned dummy). One variable indicates the presence of a buyer’s agent (a value of zero
implies only the seller’s agent is involved in the transaction), and the other variable takes a value
of one when both a buyer’s and seller’s agents are involved in the transaction and they belong to
the same brokerage company (we observe agents’ brokerage affiliations in our data).15
The results, which are presented in the panel C of Table 4, fit nicely with the theoretical
predictions. The absence of a buyer’s agent has a negligible impact on the sale price when a
selling agent is representing a client; the logged price effect (not reported in the table) is 0.0005
with a standard error of 0.002. When the agent is selling his or her own home, on the other hand,
the absence of a buyer’s agent is associated with a (statistically significant) 1.9 percent increase in
the sale price, raising the agent-owned gap from 3.3 percent to 5.2 percent. One interpretation of
this result is that home buyers without agents are less well informed and susceptible to paying
higher prices if the seller’s realtor wishes to extract the surplus. But, since the selling agent earns
twice as much by selling to a buyer without an agent, they do not attempt to extract the surplus
for their client at the risk of the deal failing to go through. When the agent sells his or her own
home, however, buyers without agents are exploited to the full extent possible since the agent is
the residual claimant.

15

Time-on-the-market regressions will not provide meaningful information in this context, since time on
the market is a function of the entire history of the house’s listing experience, and has little to do with
precise identity of the final purchaser and whether that person is represented by an agent or if that agent
shares a brokerage with the seller’s agent.

18

VI. Conclusion
Experts hold valuable information. This information is helpful to those who hire them,
but can also be a source of welfare-reducing distortions. In this paper, we examine economic
interactions between experts and their clients in a particular industry, residential real estate. The
empirical estimates suggest the distortions are non-trivial: agents sell their own homes for 3.7
percent (roughly $7,700) more than they sell their client’s homes, and leave their houses on the
market roughly 10 days (10 percent) longer. The greater informational advantage the agent
enjoys, the larger the difference between the price and time on the market experience of agents
and the clients they represent. The combination of real estate agents’ information advantage
along with the commission form of the typical real estate contract combine to create distortions
from first best. Homeowners are induced by their agents to sell too quickly and at a price that is
too low.
Our results are not consistent with a model in which unobservable agent effort is the
driving force. While that model may predict higher sales prices for agent-owned homes, it also
predicts such homes will sell at least as quickly, the opposite of what we observe. Nor are our
results consistent with a model in which reputation effectively disciplines agents. In that model,
one would expect to observe no systematic differences between agent-owned homes and those
sold by their clients. The gaps we observe are too large to be easily reconciled with systematic
differences in degrees of risk aversion or discount factors.
If our hypothesis is correct, it raises the puzzle of why a contractual form that so badly
misaligns agent and home-seller incentives arose and persists. One might imagine a better
alternative would be similar to the model commonly employed in resale of used automobiles, in
which an intermediary purchases used cars and then resells them at a markup to buyers with
higher valuations. By purchasing the used cars outright, the intermediary then earns the full
markup, rather than a small percentage as with houses. Such a system, however, would appear to
be even less efficient than the current set-up for home sales because the carrying costs of a home

19

are so great. The implied interest payments on a $200,000 home are roughly $1,000-$1,500 per
month at reasonable interest rates. If it took, say, an average of 3-6 months for an intermediary to
turnover a home, this holding could well exceed the distortion we estimate under the current
system. Moreover, from a social welfare standpoint, having the house sit empty would be more
costly than the distortion created by the current structure, which is merely a transfer from seller to
buyer. Thus, giving the intermediary the full marginal benefit is unlikely to be a superior
alternative, although intermediate systems that capture elements of both have been proposed
(Jares, Larsen, and Zorn 2000).16
Another possible contractual arrangement would involve nonlinear commission
structures, where the share paid to the agent would grow in the sales price. However, such a
structure would be difficult to implement, precisely because the homeowner is less informed than
the agent. It is not easy to see how sellers can set effective breakpoints in a nonlinear contract if
they have imperfect information about home values and the state of the market. Nonetheless for
price levels that are well below the minimum threshold of the home’s value, there is no obvious
rationale for paying the agent a commission, except for the simplicity of the linear contract.
Why, in spite of the obvious flaws, has the current contractual form in real estate remained so
pervasive and resistant to change, even as parallel improvements in information have so radically
altered the markets and commission structures for travel agents and stock brokers?17
If agents’ only service to home sellers is the information they provide about valuations
and likely offers, it is surprising that more sellers don’t more frequently hire an independent
appraiser to inform them of the value of their home. An appraiser is disinterested in the final
transaction price, which would eliminate the distortions created by the agent’s contractual form
16

Interestingly, consignment used car lots exist in some localities. That is, the real estate model has been
applied toward used cars, instead of the other way around. These lots usually specialize in low-value
automobiles that would otherwise be ignored by traditional used car sellers. It would be interesting to
examine why such selling models sometimes arise.

20

(but could induce moral hazard problems). Furthermore, appraisers can provide this information
at a fairly low cost. It may be that appraisers, in their current form, are actually less skilled at
valuing homes in a particular area than are local real-estate agents. Nonetheless, this begs the
question why this market niche has not arisen. Alternatively, it may be the case that agents
provide a bundle of services besides just valuation information, and these services are worth the
commission cost despite the distortions highlighted above.

17

Despite the fact that commissions have not shown a secular downward trend, real estate agents may not
have fared any better than stock brokers. Hsieh and Moretti (2003) demonstrate that free entry of agents
quickly dissipates rents due to rising real estate prices.

Notes: Summary statistics reflect our sample of roughly 98,038 single-family home sales over the period 1992-2002 in 34 Cook County, Illinois suburbs. Homes
sold without real-estate agents are excluded from the sample, as are homes that are listed on the Multiple Listing Service but do not sell, and Multiple Listing
Service entries with data errors or inconsistencies. All variables included in the data are self-reported by the real-estate agent listing a home for sale. The
keywords are taken from the written description of the home included in the listing. Columns 1 and 2 report information for raw data covering the whole sample.
Columns 3-6 present information after removing city-fixed effects and year-fixed effects. Columns 6-8 remove year-fixed effects and city-block fixed effects.

Notes: Regression coefficients are reported in the table, along with standard errors in parentheses. Results are based on a sample of 98,038 single-family home
sales in 34 Cook County, Illinois suburbs over the period 1992-2002. The dependent variable in the top panel of the table is the natural log of the sale price; the
dependent variable in the bottom panel is the number of days on the market. Each coefficient reported in the table is from a separate regression. The other
variables included in each specification are noted in the table, but the coefficients on these other variables are not reported in the table. Table 3 presents full
regression results for the third column of this table. The bottom row of the table reports the implied informational rent accruing to agents selling their own
homes, under the assumption of a 20 percent annual discount rate. The informational rent is computed as the additional price received for a home adjusted for
the extra time on the market.

Notes: All coefficients in the table correspond to variations on the specification reported in column 4 of
Table 2. Panels A and B divide the sample in to mutually exclusive, exhaustive sub-samples. The
heterogeneity of a city block’s housing stock is computed based on the Herfindahl index of styles of houses
sold on the block in our sample period (e.g. Victorian, Georgian, colonial, etc.). Blocks with fewer than
three home sales over the course of the sample are excluded from the analysis in Panel A. The remaining
sample is divided into equally sized groups based on the Herfindahl measure. Panel B divides the sample
according to the year that a house is originally listed for sale. Panel C adds interactions between whether a
buyer’s agent is part of the transaction and the agent-owned variable to the baseline specification.
