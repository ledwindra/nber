    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines how liquidity shocks caused by currency shortages impact exports. We explore this in the context of India\u2019s 2016 currency demonetization, a sudden government policy announcement that led to 86% of the country\u2019s currency in circulation being rendered illegal within hours. Our analysis uses novel data, including high-frequency customs transaction records matched with exporting firms and their balance sheets, as well as with inter-district domestic trade. While the cash shortages do not directly affect exporting firms, we find a significant and immediate decline in real exports for firms whose domestic customers experience liquidity shocks.\n\n",
