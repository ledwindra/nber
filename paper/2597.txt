Sovereign-Debt Renegotiations:

A

Strategic Analysis

ABSTRACT

Abstract: The process of debt—reschedulingbetween a creditor and a sovereign
(LDC) debtor is modeled as a noncooperative game built on a one—sector growth
model.
The creditor's threat to impose default penalties is ignored here as
inherently incredible; instead, the debtor's motivation for repayment is to
reap benefits from attaining an improved credit standing in international
The creditor can forgive portions of the outstanding debt.
capital markets.
so that a real—time bargaining process results with concessions being in the
form of debt—service payments by the debtor and debt forgiveness by the
creditor.
Subgame-'perfect equilibria of the game are characterized: the main
finding is that these all result in Pareto optima in which the creditor
extracts all the surplus.

Introduction
Any attempt to shed light on LDC—debt renegotiations must necessarily

come to grips with the question of why sovereign nations repay any portion of
their debts in the first place (or with its counterpart of why banks ever
choose to lend to sovereign nations).

explanations of this phenomenon, it is sometimes argued that countries say

as improved future access to capital markets, or to avoid future penñties,

10 this paper we explore the strategic ra,pitications

of the former explanation.
The 'carrots—versus—sticks" division of nations' motivations to service
and repay their debts, while somewhat arbitrary (since into which category any
particular measure falls depends on one's perception of the status quo), has

proven to be a useful way of organizing thoughts about the LDC—debt crisis,
Eaton and Gersowitz

(1981) examine the borrowing that can be sustained by a

country whose income periodically alternates between high and low levels,
Repudiation of the debt in this model causes the country to be excluded from
future borrowing with the consequence that the country must use costlier
methods to reduce fluctuations in consumption (such as stockpiling).

Sachs

(1983) investigates a two—period growth model where the default penalty
translates into a fixed—proportion reduction in the output that can he

the factors that influence the bargaining outcome, and the

strategies that sustain it must be explictly determined.

The existing sovereign—debt literature has, for the most part, been
content to assume, often implicitly, that the threat of applying the stick or
withholding

the carrot is completelycredible.

The consequences of departing

from the assumption that the bank can somehow precommit to imposing a penalty
or withholding a bonus unless the entire debt is repaid, has been examined
previously only by Bulow and Rogoff (1986).

Making use of Rubinstein's

(1982)

bargaining model, they study the subgame—perfect bargaining equilibrium that

markets.)

There is no link to any previous time to explain how this

At the beginning of the game, the creditor forgives

exactly the amount of debt that makes the debtor just indifferent between two
plans: ignoring the debt and optimizing in the growth model on the one hand,
and, on the othsr, proceeding along the optimal program leading to ultimate

repayment assuming no further forgivenesses will be forthcoming.

The debtor

then follows the optimal repayment program, and the creditor never forgives
any additional debt.

(If at the beginning of the game the optimal program

5. Remarks and conclusions
The driving forces behind our results, as in other bargaining models
requiring subgame—perfect

equilibria, are difficult to identify.

A possLhLe

explanation may be thought to lie in the argument that the debtor cannot

credibly refuse to repay a debt if in so doing it is not made aorse sif tnr
by repudiating it.

A symmetric argument, however, should then coneinc

that the bank must forgive the entire debt since, by similar reasoning, the
bank cannot credibly refuse to accept repayment of any positive amount,

of the institutional structure

As demonstratedby Rubinstein in a pure iterated

bargaining model, the existence of fixed bargaining costs per period borne oy
each player yields results on the division of the surplus that depend
crucially on the relmtiva magnitudes of each player's respective bargainind
costs and on the order of the opportunities to make offers,

when the

—16—

assumption of

fixed costs is replaced by fixed discount factors, the

conclusions as to the way in which the surplus is divided are different and

less extreme, but still give a relative advantage to the player who moves
first.

interest rates on the new loans are often lower than on the old.

The

occurrence of repeated rescheduling of debts, however, most probably testifies
to the fact that we have omitted some features that are important in the
current crisis, especially

default penalties and uncertainty.

When

incorporated into our model, the latter could account for repeated
rescheduling,

since uncertainty,

particular version of the growth model considered; variants of it,

including

an extension to a two—sector model and the inclusion of international trade,
do not alter our main findings.

Lastly, the assumption of an infinite horizon

is not crucial—our conclusions can also be obtained in a finite—horizon
