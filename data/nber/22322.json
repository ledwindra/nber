    "abstract": "\n\nWhile the fertility effects of improving teenagers\u2019 access to contraception are theoretically ambiguous, most empirical work has shown that access decreases teen fertility. In this paper, we consider the fertility effects of access to condoms\u2014a method of contraception not considered in prior work. We exploit variation across counties and across time in teenagers\u2019 exposure to condom distribution programs in schools. We find that access to condoms in schools increases teen fertility by about 10 percent. These effects are driven by communities where condoms are provided without mandated counseling.\n\n",
