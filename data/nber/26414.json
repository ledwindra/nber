    "abstract": "\n\nWhether immigrants advance in labor markets during their lifetime relative to natives is a fundamental question in the economics of immigration.  We examine linked census records for five cohorts, spanning 1850-1940, when immigration to the United States was at its peak.  We find a U-shaped pattern of assimilation: immigrants were \u201ccatching up\u201d to natives in the early and later cohorts, but not in between.  This change was not due to shifts in immigrants\u2019 source countries.  Instead, it was rooted in men\u2019s early-career occupations, which we associate with structural change, strengthening complementarities, and large immigration waves in the 1840s and 1900s.\n\n",
