ABSTRACT
We examine the employment responses to import competition from China and to global export
expansion from the United States, both of which have been expanding strongly during the past
decades. We find that although Chinese imports reduce jobs, at both the industry level and the
local commuting zone level, the global export expansion of US products also creates a
considerable number of jobs. On balance over the entire 1991-2007 period, job gains due to
changes in US global exports were slightly less than job losses due to Chinese imports. Using
data at both the industry level and the commuting zone level, we find a net loss of around 0.2-0.3
million jobs. When we extend the analysis to 1991-2011, we find the net job effect of import and
export exposure is roughly balanced at the commuting zone level.

Introduction

Conventional wisdom in economics is that trade liberalization will have two effects on labor
market outcomes. On the one hand, firms that face import competition may shrink or even exit
and therefore displace workers. On the other hand, firms that gain access to foreign market
should enter or expand, therefore generating new jobs. While such effects of job creation and
destruction due to international trade are commonly accepted, empirical studies, particularly
the recent growing literature on the ‘China shock’, focus on the job-reducing effect of surging
imports from China or other low-wage countries on the US labor market (Autor, Dorn, and
Hanson, 2013; Pierce and Schott, 2016; Acemoglu et al., 2016).1 Much less explored is the
job-creating effect of exports. Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) begin to explore that issue by
including net imports from China in their robustness analysis, but we do not feel that a bilateral
trade balance with a single country is the right focus. Instead we shall consider total US exports
as compared to imports from China.2
Specifically, this paper provides the first account of job creation due to the export expansion
in the United States, at both the industry level and the local labor market (commuting zone)
level. The United States is one of the leading exporting countries in the world trading system:
in 2014, the value of its merchandise exports reached more than 1.6 trillion US dollars, second
only after China. Figure 1 illustrates aggregate merchandise exports and manufacturing exports
for the US over 1991 to 2011. It shows that prior to the global financial crisis, US exports grew
strongly, from less than 600 billion (in 2007 US dollars) in 1991 to more than 1.2 trillion dollars.
1

A notable exception is Dauth, Findeisen, and Suedekum (2014), who use the German trade and labor data
to show that the rise of the East (Eastern Europe and China) caused substantial job losses in regions exposed
to import competition, while it also led to strong employment gains in regions that are more export oriented.
Their results are driven almost entirely by the rise in Eastern Europe, however, and not by China.
2
For symmetry, it might be preferable to examine total US exports and total US imports. That is the
approach taken by Feenstra and Sasahara (2017) who use a global input-output analysis and examine both
US imports from China and imports from all countries. They find that the implied employment effect of
US manufacturing imports from China is somewhat smaller than found in this paper, while the employment
effect of US manufacturing imports from the world is somewhat larger. The implied employment effect of US
manufacturing exports to the world is similar to that found here. See also note 5 and the paper by Wood (2017),
who uses a global input-output analysis to focus on US imports and exports with developing countries.

2

No doubt such an expansion in export value generated increased demand for labor. The US
export expansion was not evenly distributed across industries, however. Figure 2 lists the
top industries that have experienced the largest increase in export value during 1991 - 2007.
Among 392 revised SIC manufacturing sectors, semiconductors experienced the largest increase
in export value during 1991-1999, while motor vehicles and petroleum refining have been the
champion of export expansion in the period 1999-2007.3 These top categories reflect America’s
comparative advantage and grew much faster than many other categories, some of which even
saw reductions in exports, therefore creating large variation for our estimation.
[Figure 1 and Figure 2 here]
Empirically, however, it is not easy to obtain unbiased estimates of the effects of export
expansion due to endogeneity. While increased access to foreign markets drives up demand for
labor employment, domestic supply shocks such as new technology or TFP growth will also
promote exports, and quite possibly reduce employment, causing difficulty in identification.
Uncontrolled (often unobserved) domestic demand shocks, too, can be expected to affect export
value and labor employment simultaneously. Lack of plausible instruments probably explains
the lack of more balanced empirical evidence of the effect of both export and import shocks on
employment.
To deal with endogeneity, we adopt two instruments. First, we follow the spirit of Autor,
Dorn and Hanson (2013, henceforth ADH) to look at the export expansion of other high-income
countries.4 This is based on the assumption that these high-income countries face similar import
demand shocks in foreign countries as does the United States in its exports to those countries.
We will present evidence that these foreign demand shocks are not substantially correlated with
US domestic demand shocks, so this instrument satisfies that exclusion restriction. The second
instrument that we adopt in this paper relies on a more carefully modeling of US exports to

As a comparison, Figure A.1 in the appendix presents the top import SIC categories that have experienced
the largest increase in volume from China.

each foreign market, based on a CES framework. The export equation that we obtain includes
a term that captures the exports of other countries to that foreign market (similar to our first
instrument), and in addition, it includes the tariffs faced by the United States and all other
countries selling in that market. Thus, we construct a second instrument as the predicted US
exports based on the foreign demand for imports (except from the US), tariffs that US faces,
and the tariffs that other competing countries face in each foreign market.
Our empirical results show important job gains due to US export expansion. Based on the
industry level estimation, our results show that US export expansion net of China’s import
penetration actually led to a net gain of 324,000 jobs in the first period 1991-1999, while it led
to a net loss of 642,000 jobs for the second period 1999-2007, or 697,000 job losses for 1999-2011.
On balance over the entire 1991-2007 period or 1991-2011 periods, therefore, job gains due to
changes in US global exports largely offset job losses due to China’s imports, resulting in about
0.3-0.4 million job losses in net.
To account for effects of reallocation and local demand in general equilibrium, we also explore
the variations across US commuting zones in their exposure to export and import. We find
somewhat bigger effects of job creation due to rising US exports, while the net job loss from
Chinese imports is consistently close to the results using industry level data. Quantitatively,
accounting for local market effects implies that increased import exposure led to a loss of about
2.58 million manufacturing jobs in local labor market from 1999 to 2007, and another 0.97 million
manufacturing job losses from 1991 to 1999 . On the other hand, increased export exposure
implies a gain of 2.01 million manufacturing jobs from 1991 to 1999 and 1.34 million from 1999
to 2007. In net, however, export exposure significantly offsets the reduction in jobs caused by
import penetration, resulting in about 0.2 million net job losses. If we extend the analysis to
the period 1991-2011, then over the full 2 decades, import exposure led to about 4.22 million job
losses, while export expansion generated about 4.24 million jobs. Thus, the net effect is roughly
balanced over this longer period. We would not be surprised if a similar conclusion continued

4

to hold if we expanded US imports to include all countries while also expanding imports and
exports to include all merchandise and service trade.5
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the empirical strategy and
describes our main datasets. Section 3 shows the main industry level estimations. Section 4
examines the impact of trade exposure at the commuting zone level. Section 5 concludes.

Empirical Strategy

We take an approach similar to Acemoglu et al. (2016), investigating the effect of export growth
and import exposure on labor employment first at the industry level, and then at the local labor
market level.

2.1

Measuring Trade Exposure

Acemoglu et al. (2016) measure the change in the industry level import penetration in the US
from Chinese imports as
∆IPst =

Ys,t0

UC
∆Ms,t
,
+ Ms,t0 − Es,t0

(1)

UC
where s denotes 392 manufacturing sectors in the SIC classification. ∆Ms,t
denotes the change

in US imports from China (UC) in sector s for the time period t (t is either 1991-1999, or 1999UC
2007, and in some cases 1999-2011). To normalize, ∆Ms,t
is divided by the initial domestic

absorption, which consists the industrial real shipment, Ys,t0 , plus industry real net imports,
Ms,t0 − Es,t0 , both at initial year t0 = 1991 and deflated by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. This variable therefore measures the actual increase in import
exposure by each US manufacturing industry s. Such a change in import exposure from China
5

As explained in note 2, Feenstra and Sasahara (2017) use a global input-output analysis to estimate the
employment effects of US imports and exports. When focusing on manufacturing imports and exports from
all countries, they obtain a net job loss over 1995-2011. But when including merchandise and service imports
and exports with all countries, they obtain a substantial net job gain, due to the large job-creating effect of US
service exports. Under the global input-output approach it is difficult to control for the endogeneity of imports
and exports, however, and Feenstra and Sasahara make only limited progress towards that end. It would be
likewise challenging to extend the approach of this paper to include all countries importing to the US, and to
also include services trade, because of the need to find instruments for those imports and exports.

could be either due to a supply shock in its exports (e.g. productivity growth in China’s export
sectors), or caused by unobserved domestic shocks in the US demand. The latter component
may affect sectoral imports and sectoral employment simultaneously and therefore contaminate
trade flows. To address this endogeneity concern, ADH (2013) and Acemoglu et al. (2016)
suggest using the change in import exposure from China in eight other high-income countries
as an instrument:
∆IPstOT H

=

Ys,t0

OC
∆Ms,t
,
+ Ms,t0 − Es,t0

(2)

OC
where ∆Ms,t
measures the change in other countries’ imports from China (OC) in sector

s during the period t by these eight other nations,6 which is then normalized by the initial
domestic sectoral absorption in 1988 (t0 = 1988). The validity of this instrument relies on
the assumption that high-income countries are similarly exposed to import competition that is
driven by the supply shock in China, while the industry import demand shocks are uncorrelated
between these eight countries and the United States.
To capture the industrial export exposure, we start with an analogous measure to (1) as:
∆EPst =

∆Xs,t
,
Ys,t0

(3)

where ∆EPst measures changes in export exposure of sector s between t and t+1, defined
as changes in US sector exports ∆Xs,t , divided by the initial sectoral shipments Ys,t0 . Thus,
EPst is a measure of export intensity, capturing the share of export value out of the total
industrial output. Different from the measure of China-specific import shock, we are interested
in measuring the total US export expansion to the entire rest of the world.7
To identify the effect of import and export exposure on the industrial employment, we adopt
the following empirical specification:
∆ln(Lst ) = βt + β1 ∆IPst + β2 ∆EPst + γXs0 + st ,
6

(4)

These countries are: Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland.
An additional reason that we use these eight countries is that their disaggregated HS trade data are available
since 1991.
7
See notes 2 and 5.

6

where ∆ln(Lst ) is the annual log change in employment in sector s over time period t, Xs0 is
a set of start-of-period sectoral controls, and ∆IPst and ∆EPst measure the annual change in
import exposure from China and the annual change in export exposure, respectively. Following
Acemoglu et al. (2016), we fit this equation for stacked first differences covering two subperiods
1991-1999 and 1999-2007, where in some cases we also extend the latter subperiod to 1999-2011.
All variables in changes are annualized.
As described above, equation (4) is subject to endogeneity of the trade exposure measures.
We should use instrumental variables that are not correlated with US shocks, since those shocks
(on the demand or supply side) lead to endogenous changes in employment, imports and exports.
In ADH (2013) and Acemoglu et al. (2016), identification is achieved via the ‘China shock’,
which is a supply-shock in China. To avoid having that shock correlated with US shocks, they use
the import exposure from China in other eight high-income economies (∆IPstOT H ) as instrument,
which is intended to reflect China’s rising comparative advantage (e.g., productivity shock)
and falling trade costs in these sectors that are common to high-income importing countries.
Admittedly, this IV will also reflect demand conditions in those eight countries, but provided
that those demand conditions are not correlated with those in the US, that should not present
a problem for the IV.8
In our paper, the IV should also be uncorrelated with US shocks. Since we are modeling
exports, we aim to identify their impact on US employment from foreign demand shocks: those
shocks would lead to a rise in exports and employment that is not contaminated by other shocks
in the US market. Our first instrumental variable for export exposure uses the export expansion
8

Specifically, an unobserved common demand shock raises demand for the US domestic products, and therefore promotes employment, and will likely understate the impact of import shock. We present evidence in section
3 that foreign demand shocks are correlated with US import demand only through a common macroeconomic
shock (equal across sectors), which is controlled for in our specification; see note 13. ADH (2013) further adopt
a gravity equation and use the inferred change in China’s comparative advantage and market access vis-a-vis
the United States. In that case, the common demand shocks in high-income countries are differenced out by
importer and product fixed effects.

(5)

Using other advanced nations’ exports to instrument for the US exports closely follows the
idea of ADH (2013) and is intended to reflect common foreign demand shocks that drive exports
of both the US and the eight high-income countries. The identification relies on the exogenous
component of United States export growth that stems from the world’s rising demand for goods
in these sectors. This could be due to income growth of emerging economies since the 1980s,
when many countries experienced fast growth and move from low income to middle-income
countries, notably China and India. Income growth from emerging economies drives demand
for high-quality consumption goods from high-income countries (Costa, Garred and Pessoa,
2016). Furthermore, emerging economies (China and other newly industrialized economies) are
increasingly involved in global supply chains due to the disintegration of the production process
(Feenstra, 1998). Increasing production capacity drives up their demand for capital goods,
which are largely supplied by high-income countries (Eaton and Kortum, 2002).
These observations motivate the idea of foreign demand shocks that are correlated between
US exports and those of other high-income countries selling in the same foreign markets. We
will need to confirm that these demand shocks are not correlated with demand in the United
States itself, however, as we shall do with an equation for US exports. It is possible that export
expansion may also reflect supply-side shocks in the United States. That potential correlation
with supply-side shocks will be apparent in our derivation of the export equation, below. In
terms of estimation, a US supply shock that is labor saving will reduce US employment but
raise exports, resulting in an under-estimated OLS coefficient of exports on employment. On the
other hand, a US supply shock that expands product variety tends to increase both exports and
employment, therefore resulting in an over-estimated OLS coefficient of exports on employment.
We will propose a method of correcting for such supply shocks in the export equation, by using
fixed effects to absorb them.
8

In the following subsections, we develop a careful specification of US exports in a constantelasticity, monopolistic competition framework. That export equation will provide a method
to test and control for US demand and supply shocks, and from which we obtain a second
instrumental variable.

2.2

Predicting US Exports

To understand the driving forces underlying the US export growth, Caliendo et al. (2015) show
that from 1990 until 2011 both MFN tariffs and the preferential tariffs have fallen by nearly nine
percent, most of which was driven by substantial trade liberalization in emerging and developing
economies. Notable examples include China’s accession into the WTO in 2001, which lowered
its average import tariff from above 15 percent to below 9 percent within just a few years;
and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which integrated production chains
and the flow of consumer goods across the continent of North America. Romalis (2007) find
a substantial increase in the trade volume and output among the United State, Canada and
Mexico, particularly in the products that were previously highly protected.
Inspired by these observations, our second instrument for the US export expansion, denoted
by ∆EPstP RE , is constructed as the predicted US exports due to reductions in import tariffs
faced by the US exporters and their competitors selling in foreign countries. Similar to the first
instrument, predicted US exports ∆EPstP RE will also reflect the sales of other countries (besides
the US) selling in those foreign markets. To derive this instrument, we start from a simple
symmetric CES equation as in Romalis (2007),

Suppose that there are Msti identical product varieties in sector s produced and exported by

A reduction in wst

reflects an expansion in US product variety that
may increase both exports and labor employment simultaneously. We especially want to control for the latter
product variety effect, since it would overstate the OLS coefficient of US exports on employment.

import demand from the rest of world except the United States. Note that our first instrument
for US exports, ∆EPstOT H , uses the export expansion of eight other high-income economies to

year t0 to construct weights. This term captures the substitution between US export products
and their competitors: higher levels in Tstj raises more demand for the US export. Note that
the difference between the tariffs on US imports and the multilateral tariff term comes from
from the deviation from MFN tariffs (i.e. preferential tariffs due to free trade agreements, for
example). The final variable in the export equation is distance ln (dus,j ), and expect to find
β1 < 0, β2 > 0, β3 > 0, and β4 < 0 in the estimates. In our benchmark results, we use σ = 7
but we have also experimented with sigmas ranging from 1 to 6 to make sure that our results
are robust to different degree of substitutions.
Our second instrument for US exports, ∆EPstP RE , is constructed as the predicted US exports
due to changes in tariffs and multilateral import demand as specified by equation (9). Crucially,
us
we do not include the fixed effects βst
when constructing this prediction, so that it is not

contaminated by US supply shocks. In the following subsection, we introduce the data used for
prediction, and then discuss the estimation as well as other identification issues.

2.3

Tariff and Trade Data

Equation (9) guides our estimation of US total exports using data on global trade flow and tariffs.
To be more specific, we collect global trade flow data from the UN-Comtrade Database, which
provides trade value by 6-digit HS and 5-digit SITC products. Tariff schedules are collected from
the TRAINS and IDB databases accessed via the World Bank’s WITS website, which have been
complemented by manually collected tariff schedules published by the International Customs
Tariff Bureau (BITD) and made available by Feenstra and Romalis (2014) and Caliendo et al.
11

(2015). Putting these together, our empirical work is built on a comprehensive, disaggregated,
annual database with trade flow and tariff schedules which are consistently matched at 5-digit
SITC product classification for more than 150 countries over the period 1984 to 2011.
To facilitate the comparison with the effect of import exposure and employment changes,
we construct our export exposure and the instrumental variables at the revised SIC (standard
industrial classification) level which was adopted by ADH (2013) and Acemoglu et al. (2016).
The US export data at 6-digit HS product level could be readily converted to the revised SIC
product level by adopting the crosswalk (with weights) in Acemoglu et al. (2016). We then take
similar steps to construct the export value at the revised SIC level for the other eight advanced
economies, obtaining our first instrument for US exports, ∆EPstOT H .
For the second instrument, there are several steps from converting US exports at 5-digit SITC
products across importing countries to measuring export exposure at the revised SIC product
level. First, we estimate equation (9) using the above-mentioned datasets provided by Feenstra
and Romalis (2014) and Caliendo et al (2016) for US exports of product g (at SITC 5-digit)
across importing countries j, which are then aggregated across export destination markets to
SIT C
. Second, we construct a crosswalk between
get the US industrial exports, denoted as X̂gt

SITC to SIC, following Feenstra, Romalis and Schott (2002). In the cases where one SITC code
is matched to multiple SIC codes, we use the initial year export value to construct weights.10
Thirdly, we use the crosswalk provided by Acemoglu et al (2016) to convert the 1987 SIC industry
code to the revised SIC code, ending up with export values for 392 revised 4-digit SIC codes,
P
SIC
SIT C
covering each year from 1991 to 2011, which we denote accordingly as X̂st
= g∈s ωgs,t0 X̂gt
,
where s denotes the SIC sector, while ωgs,t0 is the start-of-period weights used in matching SITC
product g to SIC sector s.
The estimation results from regressing US exports at the 4-digit SITC industry level on
10

Here we adopt the 1987 SIC classification. We use US export data in 1990 to construct weights when one
SITC product is matched to multiple SIC product for years between 1990 and 2000, and similarly US exports
in 2000 to construct weights for years between 2000 and 2011. Details about the structure of US export data is
provided in Feenstra, Romalis and Schott (2002).

12

tariffs and multilateral import demand of destination markets are provided in Table 1, where
we experiment with various fixed effects. The odd columns report the benchmark results:
column (1) uses SITC fixed effects, column (3) further adds year dummies, while column (5)
uses SITC×year fixed effects. All regression coefficient estimates have the expected signs and
reasonable values.
[Table 1 about here]
As we discussed above, one concern with these estimates is that demand may be correlated
across countries, so that import growth of other countries may also reflect import growth of the
United States. To address this concern, we experiment with a set of auxiliary regressions to
test for correlations between the year-to-year changes in US demand (measured by the change
in total US imports from all sources) and the foreign demand for US goods, as measured by the
US exports (i.e., the dependent variable in our regression).11 The results are shown in Table 1.
Column (2) shows that US import growth has a significant effect on US exports, confirming that
some correlation exists. However, once we include SITC and year fixed effects, as in column (4),
the US import growth loses its significance.12 These results show that the correlation of import
demand across countries is a macroeconomic phenomena that can be controlled for by using
sector and time fixed effects. Therefore, by taking a decadal difference and including a decade
period dummy, as we do in our employment regressions, any effects of correlated demand shocks
are eliminated.13
11

We use the change in US imports because the level of US imports is found to have a unit root. Specifically,
using the Im–Pesaran–Shin test (for large N and fixed T), and including a time trend, the null hypothesis of a
unit-root in the panel of US imports by SITC industry cannot be rejected.
12
A comparison of the odd columns with their corresponding even columns shows that the number of observations is reduced. This is because the US import variable is not available for all SITC products that the US is
exporting. Moreover, the reduction in the number of observations accounts for nearly all of the change in the
coefficient estimates of other variables (such as tariffs) in the regression.
13
In Appendix Table A.1, we explore the relationship between exports of each of the eight high-income countries
and the change in US imports. When SITC and year fixed effects are included, the change in US imports is
insignificant in 5 out of 8 cases, positive and significant at the 1% level in two cases (Japan and Finland),
and negative and significant at 10% level in one case (New Zealand). This further indicates that there is little
systematic evidence for a correlation between the country’s exports to third markets and US import demand,
provided that sector and time fixed effects are controlled for.

13

The other threat to our identification is that the supply shock originated in the United
States may be correlated with the supply shocks from other exporting countries. As shown in
us
equation (9), βst
includes the US export variety and production marginal costs, and reflects a US

supply shock (such as an expansion in product variety). Thus, in column (5) we further include
SITC×year fixed effects, which absorb the supply shock. This is our preferred specification, and
the second instrument is constructed from the predicted values in column (5), but excluding the
SITC×year fixed effects. Using these predictions, we construct the second instrument as,
∆EPstP RE =

SIC
SIC
(X̂st
− X̂st
)
0
,
Ys,t0

(10)

which is at the revised SIC industry level and is used as the instrument for the actual US export
expansion.
After the above steps, we end up with measures of the change in US import penetration
from China and its instrument, as well as the change in US export expansion to the world and
two instruments, for 392 revised SIC manufacturing sectors.

2.4

US Employment

For US employment changes we use the County Business Patterns (CBP) for the years 1991,
1999, 2007, and 2011. We use the same data coverage as Acemoglu et al (2016) and follow
their steps to merge the data into 392 manufacturing sectors and 87 non-manufacturing sectors
by 722 commuting zones. For additional sectoral level information within the manufacturing
sector (such as the number of production workers and nonproduction workers, and a number
of sectoral controls which we will discuss in detail in later sections), we use the NBER-CES
Manufacturing Industry Database for the same years 1991, 1999, 2007.14
Table 2 summarizes our main variables of interests, including the measures of import and
export exposure, changes in labor employment, and instrumental variables.

Exports Create Jobs in Manufacturing

3.1

Benchmark Industry Estimation

Table 3 takes a first look at the impact of US exports to the world, in addition to its import exposure from China. Following Acemoglu et al. (2016), we adopt a stacked first-difference model
for the two time periods 1991-1999 and 1999-2007. Column (1) starts with an OLS regression,
where import exposure from China has a significantly negative impact on the industrial employment growth, while export expansion creates a positive and significant effect on employment.
More specifically, a one percentage point rise in industry import penetration reduces domestic
industry employment by 0.74 percentage points, while a one percentage point rise in export
expansion increases industrial employment by 0.39 percentage points.
As noted above, both estimates for the import exposure and export exposure could be biased
due to simultaneous changes in domestic demand and supply. Thus, starting from column (2)
we present results that use 2SLS. Recall that we have two instruments for export expansion,
thus we clarify at the top of each column which instrument(s) are used for exports. Column
(2) presents the results with the first instrument for US exports (i.e., contemporaneous changes
in export from other eight countries to the rest of world except the United States, ∆EPstOT H ),
for period 1991-2007. It shows that, after correcting the simultaneity bias, we obtain larger
estimates than the OLS estimates, for both import and export expansion. This is consistent
with a US product demand shock that increases imports, decreases exports, while reducing
employment and therefore biasing the OLS coefficients on both imports and exports towards
zero. On the other hand, a US supply shock that is labor saving will reduce employment, raise
output and likely reduce imports, but raise exports, which will also bias the OLS coefficients
towards zero.
In a third scenario, a US supply shock that results in the expansion of product variety will
increase exports and employment, resulting in an over-estimated OLS coefficient on the export
variable. This possibility calls for a careful derivation of a gravity-type prediction of US exports,

15

which we have provided in section 2. The predicted US export (i.e., ∆EPstP RE ) is used as an
IV in column (3). In this case, the estimated effect of exports on employment is lower than
that implied by column (2) but is still significant, resulting in lower implied job gains. However,
as we show later in the commuting zone level regressions, using predicted US exports as an
instrument generates stronger effect while using other eight countries’ exports as instruments
will give a weaker result, so both the export instruments are of interest.
In column (4), we include both instruments for US exports. As shown in equation (9),
∆EPstP RE — our second instrument — contains different information from the first instrument:
it includes the tariff terms and gives a careful specification of the multilateral demand term. We
use both instruments as our preferred specification because it makes full use of the information.15
Based on the results in column (4), a one percentage point rise in industry import penetration
reduces domestic industry employment by 1.3 percentage points, while a one percentage point
rise in export expansion increases industrial employment by 0.69 percentage points. Columns
(5)-(7) further extend the sample period to 2011, and the results are similar qualitatively: import
exposure reduces jobs while export expansion creates them. In the bottom panels, we report
the first stage regression results for the two endogenous variables. In most cases the F-statistics
for the excluded instruments are well above the Stock-Yogo weak IV test critical value at 10%
level.
[Table 3 about here]
Relying on the preferred estimation results in column (4) of Table 3, we can evaluate the
economic magnitude of trade shocks on labor employment. From equation (4), and following
Acemoglu et al. (2016), changes in industrial employment brought about by the increase in
15

In the Appendix Table A.2, we investigate what extra information the second instrument adds. We find
that the results from using both instruments are very similar to the results from using the first IV and the tariff
component of the second IV (though the tariff component does not always have the expected sign in the first
stage). But when we instead use the tariff and the non-tariff components of the second IV separately, the export
variable has a smaller coefficient.

16

imports and export can be expressed as:16
!
∆Lt =

X

Ls,t (1 − e(β̂1 ∆IPst +β̂2 ∆EPst ) ) ,

(11)

s

where β̂1 and β̂2 are the 2SLS coefficient estimates. Hypothetically, this equation calculates
the difference between the actual and counterfactual manufacturing employment in year t if
there are no changes in import and export exposure. Applying the actual changes in import
penetration (∆IPst ) and export expansion (∆EPst ), we calculate the net employment changes
due to trade shocks. Export expansion net of China import penetration actually led to a net
gain of 324,000 jobs in the first period 1991-1999, while it led to a net loss of 642,000 jobs for
the second period 1999-2007, and 697,000 job losses for 1999-2011.17
Given that the observed changes in manufacturing employment over these time periods were
a slight increase of 200,000 jobs in 1991-1999, and a large reduction of 3.34 million jobs in 19992007 (and another 2.48 million job losses from 2007 to 2011), import penetration contributed
a substantial share of job losses, particularly in the second period when imports from China
grew much faster. However, export expansion also created a considerable number of jobs at
the same time, without which employment in US manufacturing would have been experienced
a much worse contraction. On balance over the entire 1991-2007 period, therefore, job gains
due to changes in US global exports largely offset job losses due to imports competition from
China, resulting in about 0.32 million job losses in net. And, when we extend the time period
to 2011, in net there are about 0.4 million job losses.18
16

We are assuming that when ∆IPst = ∆EPst = 0, then the China shock and export opportunities have
zero impacts on the level of employment, and not just on its difference. In other words, we are assuming that
import penetration and export expansion do not create a common employment effect across industries that we
are omitting in the diff-in-diff specification.
17
If we focus on the export channel while shutting down the other (e.g. import exposure from China), then
export expansion brought about 805,000 jobs in 1991-1999, and about 514,000 jobs in 1999-2007. On the other
hand, if we focus on import shocks from China, the import competition led to 521,000 job losses in 1991-1999,
and 1.24 million job losses in 1999-2007.
18
In the bottom rows of Table 3, we present the implied net job change during different periods, for each
specification.

3.2

Robustness with Additional Controls

As we have discussed above, industries subject to greater trade shocks may also be exposed to
other economic fluctuations that are correlated with import and export growth. In Table 4, we
add as robustness checks additional controls to address this concern. Following Acemoglu et
al. (2016), we consider three groups of controls. In all regressions, we use both ∆EPstOT H and
∆EPstP RE to instrument for export expansion, and the same ADH-type instrument ∆IPstOT H for
import shocks. First, column (1) includes a set of dummies for 10 one-digit broad manufacturing
categories, which allows for differential trends across these one-digit sectors given our first
differences specification. Column (2) considers a set of sectoral controls drawn from the NBERCES database, including the share of production workers in sectoral employment, the log of
the industrial average wage, the ratio of capital to value added (all measured in 1991), and
computer and high tech equipment investment and pretrend variables in 1990 as a share of
total 1990 investment. Column (3) captures the secular trends that US manufacturing has
been declining since the 1950s and that manufacturing employment has been falling since the
1980s. Such a long-standing trend predates the recent rise in trade shocks and may overstate
the impact of trade exposure in the current period. Thus, column (3) adds the change in the
industry’s share of total US employment and the change in the log of the industry average
wage, both measured over 1976-1991. Then in column (4), we include all three sets of controls
simultaneously.
[Table 4 about here]
Throughout columns (1) to (4), the coefficient estimates for export exposure are significant
and stable in magnitude. With the full sets of controls, a one percentage point rise in industry import penetration reduces domestic industry employment by 0.81 percentage points, while
a one percentage point rise in export expansion increases industrial employment by 0.63 percentage points. Finally in column (5) we include a full set of dummies for the 392 four-digit
manufacturing industries. Using this full set of industry dummies in the stacked first-difference
18

specification, the effect of trade shocks is identified by changes in the growth rates of industry employment and the trade exposure measures in the second period (1999-2007) relative to
the first period (1991-1999). The coefficient estimates in this very demanding specification are
noticeably reduced for both import and export exposure.
The last two columns (6)-(7) extend the coverage of the sample to 1991-2011. Column (6)
uses full sets of industrial controls and obtains similar results, confirming the robustness of the
job creating effect of export expansion. Column (7) uses the full set of industry dummies. In
both cases, the impact of export expansion remains similar to column (5) for 1991-2007, while
the significance and magnitude of the import coefficient is reduced further.

3.3

Impact on Other Industrial Outcomes

Next we explore the impact of trade exposure on other outcomes. Columns (1) to (5) of Table
5 use CBP data while columns (6)-(10) use NBER-CES database. Increasing import exposure
reduces employment (col. 1), the number of establishment (col. 2), average employment per
establishment (col. 3), the total wage bill (col. 4), and it also reduces employment of both
production workers (col. 6) and non-production workers (col. 7). Interestingly, increasing
import exposure increases the workers’ real wage (col. 5), and has no significant effect on real
wages of production and nonproduction workers separately (col. 8 and col. 9).
Export expansion, on the other hand, substantially increases employment (col. 1), the
number of establishment (col. 2), employment per establishment (col. 3), and the real wage
bill (col. 4), but has no significant impact on real wage (col. 5); it also increases employment
in both production workers (col. 6) and non-production workers (col. 7), and the real wages of
both types of workers (col. 8 and col. 9), though the wage effects on non-production workers
are not significant. Finally column (10) shows that export expansion substantially increases real
industrial output while import competition has no significant effect.
[Table 5 about here]

3.4

Accounting for Input-Output Linkages

Trade impacts may go beyond the industry boundary and propagate upstream and downstream.
Note this effect is not limited to within the manufacturing sector (e.g. an automobile producer
may be exposed to trade shocks in upstream steel industry, or vice versa), and trade shocks in
manufacturing will also affect services and other nontradable sectors. Wang et al. (2017), for
example, focus on China’s position as a supplier of intermediate inputs for US sectors and argue
that the net effect from trading with China on US employment is modestly positive.
To make our results closely comparable to ADH (2013) and Acemoglu et al. (2016), we
apply the same input-output table for 1992 from the BEA to study the interindustry linkages.
First, the upstream effect of export and import exposure measures the impact of downstream
sectors’ trade exposure on upstream suppliers. That is:
∆IPstup =

X

u
ωgs
∆IPgt ,

and

∆EPstup =

X

u
ωgs
∆EPgt ,

(12)

g

g

up
is the use coefficient which tells the share of product s used as input in industry g,
where ωgs

which is derived from the 1992 BEA input-output matrix. Thus ∆IPstup is a weighted average of
the trade shocks faced by downstream buyers of products from sector s. When a downstream
sector g experiences an export expansion, it may also increase its demand for intermediate inputs
from its upstream sector s.
We could similarly compute the downstream effect of export and import exposure, which
measures the impact of upstream sectors’ trade exposure on downstream buyers. When an
upstream sector g experiences an export expansion, it may drive up the domestic price for g,
which creates a negative impact on domestic downstream users in sector s. On the other hand,
export expansion may improve the productivity of upstream sector g, and therefore generate
positive downstream effects on sector s. The downstream measures are:
∆IPstdown =

X

d
ωsg
∆IPgt ,

and

g

∆EPstdown =

X

d
ωsg
∆EPgt ,

g

d
where ωsg
measures the input share of product g used as input in industry s.

20

(13)

Using equations (12) and (13), we can generate instruments for both the upstream and downstream exposure measures. Table 6 presents the 2SLS estimation results, for period 1991-2011.
Column (1) focuses on the effect of import shocks, augmented with upstream and downstream
import exposure, for 392 manufacturing sectors. Besides the significant direct effect of import
exposure, upstream import exposure also exerts a negative impact on industrial employment,
while downstream import exposure has a positive but not significant effect. Column (2) further
incorporates changes in export exposure. In this case, the direct within-sector effect of export
exposure is positive and significant. Furthermore, buyers’ export exposure also creates significant and positive effect on the employment of upstream suppliers (as shown by the coefficient for
the upstream export exposure), while the effect of downstream export exposure is not precisely
estimated.
Column (3) considers only the non-manufacturing sector while columns (4) extends the
sample to consider both manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. Although exposure at
the upstream and downstream sectors exerts positive effects on non-manufacturing employment,
the effects are not significant except for the downstream export exposure on non-manufacturing
employment. Given that most effects come from the direct and the upstream exposure, columns
(5)-(6) sum the upstream and direct trade exposures, confirming that import exposure reduces
jobs while export expansion creates them.
[Table 6 about here]
Moreover, the above equations account for the direct transmission of shocks along the intersectoral input-output linkage. Upstream and downstream effects could also take force indirectly
through iteration. For example, a shock to the plastics sector may affect the downstream
computer industry, and further affect that transportation sector that relies on computers. Such
impacts across sectors generate a full chain of implied responses based on the input-output
matrix. Therefore we augment the results in Table 6 with the Leontief inverse of the matrix, in
which case we find similar results and so we report them in the Appendix, Table A.3.

4

Export Exposure on Local Labor Markets

The industry level results compare changes in relative employment across manufacturing sectors with different exposure to import penetration and export expansion. As emphasized by
Acemoglu et al (2016), this approach cannot identify the reallocation and demand effects which
occur in general equilibrium. In their influential work, ADH (2013) quantify the reallocation
effects by focusing on cross-regional variations in local commuting zones’ responses to trade
shocks. In this section, we follow ADH (2013) and Acemoglu et al. (2016) and explore the
geographic differences in trade shocks, based on 722 commuting zones (CZs) that cover the
entire US mainland.
We begin by first constructing the Bartik measures of CZ level import and export exposure
as:
∆IPitCZ =

X Lis,t
s

0

Li,t0

∆IPst ,

and

∆EPitCZ =

X Lis,t
s

0

Li,t0

∆EPst ,

(14)

where i denotes commuting zone, s denotes SIC manufacturing sectors, ∆IPst and ∆EPst are
sectoral import and export exposure that we have used in the previous sections. So ∆IPitCZ
and ∆EPitCZ denote the increases in import and export exposures respectively, by commuting
zone i for time period t (either 1990-2000, or 2000-2007/2011). Note that Lis,t0 is the start of
period employment in manufacturing sector s and commuting zone i, while Li,t0 is the start of
period total employment for commuting zone i, including both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing employment. The variation in import and export exposures across commuting zones
comes entirely from the differences in local industry structure in employment in the initial year.
Figure 3 presents a comparison of the regional exposures to imports and exports during the two
subperiods.
[Figure 3 about here]
As with the industry measure of trade shocks, the CZ level import and export exposures
are also likely to be subject to endogeneity problem. Therefore we apply the Bartik formula to
22

the industry level instrument ∆IPstOT H , obtaining commuting zone level instrument for import
exposure. Directly applying the Bartik formula to the industrial export exposure, however, is
subject to potential measurement error: the instruments ∆EPstOT H and ∆EPstP RE are intended
to be affine transformations of actual US exports (up to an error) at the industry level, but
not necessarily equal to such exports (up to an error). Because this transformation for each
instrument can differ across industries, not correcting for it initially will lead to measurement
error when aggregating to the commuting zone level. Accordingly, we correct for this potential
error by regressing a panel of actual exports at SIC level on the predicted exports at the same
industry aggregation, with industry fixed effects and year dummies: that is, Xst = αt + αs +
SIC
+ νst .19 Then we apply the Bartik local employment weights to the fitted value of the
δ X̂st

above estimation, obtaining our two constructed commuting zone level instruments for ∆EPitCZ .
With both exposure measures and their instruments, we estimate the following specification
across 722 commuting zones:
CZ
CZ
CZ
∆Lm
it = βt + β1 ∆IPit + β2 ∆EPit + γXit0 + γr + eit ,

(15)

where ∆Lm
st is the annual change in manufacturing employment share of the working age population in commuting zone i over time period t. To be consistent with the industry level
specification, we continue to stack the annualized first differences for the two periods, 1991-1999
and 1999-2007 or 1999-2011. In all regressions, we also include βt to control for different time
trends between the two time periods, a set of census division dummies to control for regional
specific trends, as well as the initial share of manufacturing workers (in 1991). All regressions
are weighted by the start of period (1991) commuting zone’s share of national population, and
the standard errors are clustered at the commuting zone level.
Table 7 presents results for the manufacturing employment share, for both 1991-2007 and
1991-2011 and with different sets of instruments for export expansion (as indicated in the title
19
Running this estimation prior to the industry-level estimation won’t affect these previous results in section
3 since the industry specific effects are readily controlled by the long-difference specification that we have taken,
while δ does not vary across industries.

row). The first four columns focus on 1991-2007, starting with EP OT H as the instrument
for exports. It shows that the impact of CZ level import exposure on the local manufacturing
employment share is negative and significant, while export impact is positive but not significant.
Column (2) instead uses EP P RE as the export instrument, and then export exposure is found
to have a substantial and significant impact on commuting zone manufacturing employment.
We further experiment with including both instruments for export, which is preferred because it utilizes the most information. The results are shown in column (3). We find that a
one percentage point increase in average import penetration in the local commuting zone leads
to a 1.24 percentage point reduction in the local manufacturing employment share. Export
expansion, on the other hand, increases the local manufacturing employment share by 0.79 percentage point.20 Throughout columns (1) to (3) we include a set of commuting zone level initial
demographic and economic controls, in particular the start-of-period share of manufacturing
employment. The local manufacturing employment share at the start of period has a strong
negative effect on manufacturing employment share.21 Other controls include the percentage
of college-educated population, percentage of foreign-born population, percentage of employment among women, percentage of employment in routine occupations, and finally the average
offshorability index of occupations.
Quantitatively, relying on the preferred results of column (3), accounting for local market
effects implies that increased import exposure led to a loss of about 2.58 million manufacturing
jobs in local labor market from 1999 to 2007, and another 0.97 million manufacturing job losses
20

In the appendix Table A.4, we further report results which decompose the second IV (i.e., EP P RE ) into the
tariff-related term and the multilateral import demand term according to equation (9). When using both the first
IV (EP OT H ) and the tariff term of the second IV, the results are similar to using only the first IV: the impact of
export expansion remains insignificant in 1991-2007, while becomes more significant in 1991-2011. Instead, when
we use both the tariff component and the nontariff component of the second IV, the latter capturing multilateral
demand, the export impact remains highly significant in both periods.
21
The manufacturing share is positively correlated with both export expansion and import exposure because of
the construction of the Bartik weights used in (14), where Lis,t0 in the numerator is employment in manufacturing
sector s and commuting zone i, while Li,t0 in the denominator is the total employment for commuting zone i,
including both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing employment. Thus if we omit the initial manufacturing
share which has a negative coefficient, then the coefficient on import exposure becomes more negative (stronger),
while the effect of export expansion becomes less positive (weaker). Bernard and Jensen (2000) were the first to
notice the importance of the initial manufacturing share in determining labor market outcomes.

24

from 1991 to 1999. On the other hand, increased export exposure implies a gain of 2.01 million
manufacturing jobs from 1991 to 1999 and 1.34 million from 1999 to 2007. In net, export
exposure substantially offsets the reduction in jobs caused by import competition, although it
does not eliminate them, leaving about only 0.2 million net job losses.
Columns (4)-(6) further examine the longer period 1991-2011, in which all estimates for
export exposure become significant. Based on column (6), our preferred specification with two
IVs for exports, the effect of export expansion on manufacturing employment is even stronger:
now an 1 percentage point increase in average export exposure in a local commuting zone
generates a 0.92 percentage point increase in the local manufacturing employment share. The
effect of import exposure from China remains similar to the early period. Applying these
estimated coefficients to actual trade values, then increased import exposure led to a loss of
about 1.01 million manufacturing jobs in the first period (1991-1999) in local labor market,
and 3.21 million manufacturing jobs during the longer period 1999-2011, while increased export
exposure implies a gain of 2.33 manufacturing jobs in 1991-1999, and 1.91 million manufacturing
jobs from 1999 to 2011. So over the full 2 decades, import exposure leads to about 4.22 million
job losses, while export expansion generates about 4.24 million jobs. The net effect is roughly
balanced over this longer period.
[Table 7 about here]
In Figure 4 we report the percentage job losses due to import competition from China, and
percentage job gains due to US exports, by commuting zones. These maps have much the same
pattern as was shown for the changes in import and export exposure in Figure 3, and indeed,
the percentage job changes are obtained by just multiplying those exposure-changes by their
respective coefficients in regression (15). The highest job losses in any zone are 1.2% per year
during 1991-1999 and 0.9% per year during 1999-2011, while the highest job gains are 1.0%
during 1991-1999 and 2.1% per year during 1999-2011. There is an apparent correlation in
Figure 4 between job losses and job gains across CZ, though that correlation is not as strong as
25

it appears visually: the correlation between the percentage changes in job lost and job gained
is 0.49 for the 1991-1999 period but it is only 0.20 for the 1999-2011 period.

Conclusions

The work of Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013), Pierce and Schott (2016), and Acemoglu et al.
(2016) has alerted us the impact of the China shock on US employment and unemployment. As
exports from China grew rapidly following its WTO accession in 2001, there was a marked fall
in US manufacturing employment, and in particular a geographic correlation between the inflow
of goods from China and the fall in employment within regions formerly producing those goods.
What has not received the same degree of attention in the literature is the potential for a rise
in employment within regions that produce and benefit from growing US exports. ADH (2013)
experimented with using net manufacturing imports from China, or the difference between US
imports and exports (per worker) by commuting zone, but that did not give results that were
greatly different from what they obtained with gross imports from China.
In this paper, we have re-examined the employment impact of US exports, using exports to
the world rather than just exports to China. We believe that this is a better way to evaluate the
employment impact of US exports: the growth in Chinese demand as compared to the growth in
demand from other countries for US goods are of equal interest when evaluating the employment
impact, so there is no reason to focus on Chinese demand alone.22 But demand for US exports is
endogenous. The China shock created a compelling supply-side instrument for Chinese exports
to the US, i.e. by using its exports to other industrial countries, and likewise we have had to
develop viable instruments for US exports to the world. In addition to using the exports of
other industrial countries to foreign markets, we have derived a gravity-type specification for
US exports that uses those exports of other countries along with the tariffs charged in foreign
22

countries. A careful examination of the predicted US exports makes us believe that it is less
subject to a common demand shock that affects both US exports and imports, and that both
the tariff component and the multilateral demand component of the predicted exports add extra
information to our estimation.23
Our results fit the textbook story that job opportunities in exports make up for jobs lost in
import-competing industries, or nearly so. At the industry level, the US export of manufactured
goods created enough jobs to offset all but 0.3-0.4 million of the jobs lost due to imports from
China, over the entire 1991-2011 period. When we shift to considering commuting zones, then
the net job loss over 1991-2007 is still about 0.2 million jobs, but over the longer period 19912011 the job losses are just balanced with the job gains. There is also a positive geographic
correlation between those losses and gains, so that commuting zone with higher percentage
losses are also more likely to have higher percentage gains. This result helps to explain how
local labor markets reached equilibrium even in the absence of strong mobility across regions,
though admittedly, this correlation is much weaker during the second decade (only 0.20 during
1999-2011) than the first (0.49 during 1991-1999).24 It would be desirable to further explore the
job losses and gains at the CZ level, and within broader regions rather than CZ, to understand
the equilibrating mechanism in local labor markets due to import and export shocks. We leave
this task for further research.

See notes 15 and 20, and the Appendix with Tables A.2 and A.4.
Kovak and Cadena (2016) show that low-skilled native-born workers have limited mobility between regions
and will suffer a wage or employment loss due to an adverse demand shock, whereas low-skilled immigrants and
high-skilled workers are more likely to move.

Note: For each manufacturing industry, the change in US import (or export) exposure,is computed by dividing 100 × the
annualized increase in the value of US imports (exports) over the indicated periods by 1991 US market value (1991 US industry
output) in that industry. All observations are weighted by 1991 industry employment.

The sample includes 722 commuting zones over two stacked subperiods (1991-1999, and 1999-2007 or 1999-2011). All regressions
are weighted by start-of-period population share of the commuting zone. All columns include controls for initial economic and
demographic conditions, including initial percentage of college-educated workers, foreign-born workers, women employment,
routine occupation, and finally the average offshorability index of occupation. All regressions have US census regions dummies
and a time dummy for the second period. Lower panels present the first stage regression results and F statistics for excluded
instruments.

Predicting US Exports and Decomposition
Table A.1: In Appendix Table A.1, we examine a similar specification to equation (9) but
focus on each of the eight high-income countries. More specifically, we explore the relationship between exports of country n and the US import growth. The estimation is specified
as:
!

is the multilateral tariff faced by importing country

one year log change of US import from the rest of the world

Table A.2 and A.4: As we discuss in detail in section 2, our second instrument for US
exports, ∆EPstP RE , is constructed as the predicted US exports due to tariff changes of foreign
countries on exports from the US and from other countries, and a multilateral import term
that captures the import demand by foreign countries. Equation (9) in section 2 guides the
construction of this IV. We re-state predicted exports as:
!
X k,j

ˆ
us,j
us,j
ln Xst ≡ βˆ0 + βˆ1 ln(τst ) + βˆ2 ln
Xst + βˆ3 ln(Tstj ) + βˆ4 ln dus,j .
(A.1)
k6=U S

Note that this prediction does not include the SITC×year fixed effects shown in column
us
in equation (9). Instead we include
(5) of Table 1, which reflect the US supply-side term βst
a single constant term β0 in the prediction, whose value βˆ0 is chosen so that the mean of
ˆus,j equals the mean of actual US exports X̂ us,j over all s and t. After
predicted exports Xst
st
the conversion of predicted exports from SITC to SIC industries, the instrument ∆EPstP RE is
obtained as in equation (10) in section 2. Note that the normalization to predicted exports
affects the first-stage coefficients on that instrumental variable, because predicted exports
appear as a level in equation (10), but it has no impact on the second-stage coefficients or
standard errors.
In appendix tables A.2 and A.4, we break apart the instrument ∆EPstP RE into its two
components, one of which reflects the tariffs faced by the United States and other countries
in each foreign market, and the other of which reflects multilateral import demand in each
foreign market for all countries (other than the US). Because ∆EPstP RE is constructed using
the level of predicted exports and not its log, whereas the log of exports is used in equation
(9) and (A.1), there is not a unique method to decompose ∆EPstP RE into its two components.
Accordingly, we construct and report results from two methods, as follows.
Method 1: In the first method, we make use of country j’s tariffs applied to the US and
all other countries, which are the second and fourth terms on the right of (A.1) and appear
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
in levels as eβ0 (τstus,j )β1 (Tstj )β3 . We have included the constant term βˆ0 in this expression to
indicate that we make the same normalization on this definition of the tariff term as discussed
just above for predicted exports: namely, that the mean value of this tariff term equals the
42

mean value of actual US exports.25 After converting this tariff term from SITC to SIC
industries, the new instrument ∆EPstT AR1 is then obtained by dividing the changes in that
SIC-based based tariff term by the initial US shipments, analogous to equation (10). After
this construction, we define another new instrument, reflecting the change in multilateral
demand, as:
∆EPstM LD1 ≡ ∆EPstP RE − ∆EPstT AR1 .
(A.2)
In the appendix tables A.2 and A.4 we make use of the two instruments ∆EPstT AR1 and
∆EPstM LD1 , which are designed to break up the combined instrument ∆EPstP RE into its two
components: i.e., tariff changes and multilateral demand. In addition, we include ∆EPstT AR1
with our first instrument for US exports, ∆EPstOT H . This instrument follows Acemoglu et
al. (2016) and uses the export expansion of eight other high-income economies to the world
except the United States, and is therefore similar to the multilateral demand instrument,
except that the latter has a more careful specification of all the countries (excluding the US)
selling to each foreign market.
Method 2: In the second method, we make use of country j’s multilateral import demand
from the rest of world except the United States, which is the third term on the right of (A.1),
βˆ2

ˆ P
ˆ
k,j
and we also include distance which then appear in levels as eβ0
X
(dus,j )β4 .
st
k6=U S
Once again, we have included the constant term βˆ0 in this expression to indicate that we
normalize the mean of this multilateral demand term to equal the mean value of actual
US exports. After converting this multilateral demand term from SITC to SIC industries,
the new instrument ∆EPstM LD2 is then obtained by dividing the changes in that SIC-based
based multilateral demand by the initial US shipments, analogous to equation (10). After
this construction, we define a second instrument reflecting the change in tariffs, as:
∆EPstT AR2 ≡ ∆EPstP RE − ∆EPstM LD2 .

(A.3)

In the appendix tables A.2 and A.4 we also make use of the two instruments ∆EPstM LD2
and ∆EPstT AR2 , which again break up the combined instrument ∆EPstP RE into its two components. As mentioned above, there is not a unique way to break up this instrument, so this
second method provides an alternative to the first method.
By construction, we expect that first-stage coefficients on ∆EPstM LD1 , ∆EPstT AR1 , ∆EPstM LD2
and ∆EPstT AR2 are all positive. That holds in most cases in Tables A.2 and A.4, except for
∆EPstT AR1 when it is used along with the first export instrument, ∆EPstOT H . But when
EPstT AR2 is used along with ∆EPstOT H then both instruments are positive and significant in
the first stage regressions, indicating that the tariff variable is adding information to the
ADH-style export instrument ∆EPstOT H or to multilateral demand itself. See also notes 15
and 20.

This is a slight abuse of notation, because the value βˆ0 needed to normalize the mean of predicted exports
to equal the mean of actual exports differs from the value needed to likewise normalize the tariff term to
equal the mean of exports.

The sample includes 722 commuting zone manufacturing sectors during different periods. All regressions are weighted by
start-of-period population share of the commuting zone. All columns include controls for initial economic and demographic
conditions, including initial percentage of college-educated workers, foreign-born workers, women employment, routine
occupation, and finally the average offshorability index of occupation. All regressions have US census regions dummies and
a time dummy for the second period. The definitions of the first-stage variables are discussed above in the Appendix, see
especially (A.2) and (A.3).
