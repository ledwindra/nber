    "abstract": "\n\nThis essay provides a review of two important recent books on economic growth: How the World Became Rich by Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin and Slouching Towards Utopia, by J. Bradford DeLong. Each book is noteworthy for its erudition and breadth.  I explore strengths and weaknesses of these books and make some proposals on new ways to conceptualize and study long run socioeconomic development.  My discussion emphasizes the importance of contingency in determining long run inequalities across countries as well the potential for ideas from complexity theory to augment standard growth modelling.\n\n",
