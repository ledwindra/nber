    "abstract": "\n\nBlackouts impose substantial costs on electricity consumers in developing countries. We advance a new explanation for their continued prevalence in India, the world\u2019s third-largest power sector: unlike in the developed world, utilities\u2019 wholesale electricity demand is downward-sloping. We construct a novel dataset on power plant operations and demand. Instrumenting for cost with plausibly exogenous power plant equipment outages, we estimate a wholesale demand elasticity of \u20130.43. As a result, any increase in procurement costs will reduce the amount of electricity retail customers receive. Wholesale market simulations suggest that lowering procurement costs could eliminate blackouts for millions of Indian households.\n\n",
