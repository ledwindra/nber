Our goal is to determine how shifts in macroeconomic policies in the U.S. or Japan affectthe other country as well as the rest of the world. In particular we examine the following three issues: (1) the likely macroeconomic ramifications for the U.S., Europe and Japan of significant budget cuts in the U.S.; (2) the macroeconomic implications of a protectionist tariff imposed by the U.S.; and (3) the scope for policy coordination among the U.S., Japan and Europe.\n\n",
