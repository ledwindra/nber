A \u201cstandard\u201d model that includes real interest rates and a measure of expected inflation for the U.S. and the foreign country, the U.S. comprehensive trade balance, and measures of global risk and liquidity demand is well-supported in the data for the U.S. against other G10 currencies. The monetary and non-monetary variables play equally important roles in explaining exchange rate movements. In the 1970s \u2013 early 1990s, the fit of the model was poor but the fit (as measured by t- and F-statistics, and R-squareds) has increased almost monotonically to the present day. We make the case that it is better monetary policy (inflation targeting) that has led to the improvement, as the scope for self-fulfilling expectations has disappeared. We provide a variety of evidence that links changes in monetary policy to the performance of the exchange-rate model.\n\n",
