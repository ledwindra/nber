    "abstract": "\n\nWe theoretically characterize the behavior of machine learning asset pricing models. We prove that expected out-of-sample model performance\u2014in terms of SDF Sharpe ratio and test asset pricing errors\u2014is improving in model parameterization (or \u201ccomplexity\u201d). Our empirical findings verify the theoretically predicted \u201cvirtue of complexity\u201d in the cross-section of stock returns. Models with an extremely large number of factors (more than the number of training observations or base assets) outperform simpler alternatives by a large margin.\n\n",
