ABSTRACT
In this paper we study methods for estimating causal effects in settings with panel data, where a
subset of units are exposed to a treatment during a subset of periods, and the goal is estimating
counterfactual (untreated) outcomes for the treated unit/period combinations. We develop a class
of matrix completion estimators that uses the observed elements of the matrix of control
outcomes corresponding to untreated unit/periods to predict the “missing” elements of the matrix,
corresponding to treated units/periods. The approach estimates a matrix that well-approximates
the original (incomplete) matrix, but has lower complexity according to the nuclear norm for
matrices. From a technical perspective, we generalize results from the matrix completion
literature by allowing the patterns of missing data to have a time series dependency structure. We
also present novel insights concerning the connections between the matrix completion literature,
the literature on interactive fixed effects models and the literatures on program evaluation under
unconfoundedness and synthetic control methods.

Introduction

In this paper we develop new methods for estimating average causal effects in settings with
panel or longitudinal data, where a subset of units is exposed to a binary treatment during
a subset of periods, and we observe the realized outcome for each unit in each time period.
To estimate the (average) effect of the treatment on the treated units in this setting, we
focus on imputing the missing potential outcomes. The statistics and econometrics literatures have taken two general approaches to this problem. The literature on unconfoundedness (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983); Imbens and Rubin (2015)) imputes missing potential
outcomes using observed outcomes for units with similar values for observed outcomes in
previous periods. The synthetic control literature (Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003); Abadie
et al. (2010, 2015); Doudchenko and Imbens (2016)) imputes missing control outcomes for
treated units by finding weighted averages of control units that match the treated units in
terms of lagged outcomes. Although at first sight similar, the two approaches are conceptually quite different in terms of the patterns in the data they exploit to impute the missing
potential outcomes. The unconfoundedness approach estimates patterns over time that are
assumed to be stable across units, and the synthetic control approach estimates patterns
across units that are assumed to be stable over time. Both sets of methods also primarily
focus on settings with different structures on the missing data or assignment mechanism.
In the case of the unconfoundedness literature typically the assumption is that the treated
units are all treated in the same periods, typically only the last period, and there are a substantial number of control units. The synthetic control literature has primarily focused on
the case where one or a small number of treated units are observed prior to the treatment
over a substantial number of periods.
In this study we also draw on the econometric literature on factor models and interactive
fixed effects, and the computer science and statistics literatures on matrix completion, to

2

take an approach to imputing the missing potential outcomes that is different from the
unconfoundedness and synthetic control approaches. In the literature on factor models
and interactive effects (Bai and Ng (2002); Bai (2003)) researchers model the observed
outcome, in a balanced panel setting, as the sum of a linear function of covariates and
an unobserved component that is a low rank matrix plus noise. Estimates are typically
based on minimizing the sum of squared errors given the rank of the matrix of unobserved
components, sometimes with the rank estimated. Xu (2017) applies this to causal settings
where a subset of units is treated from common period onward, so that the complete data
methods for estimating the factors and factor loadings can be used. The matrix completion
literature (Candès and Recht (2009); Candès and Plan (2010); Mazumder et al. (2010))
focuses on imputing missing elements in a matrix assuming the complete matrix is the sum
of a low rank matrix plus noise and the missingness is completely at random. The rank of
the matrix is implicitly determined by the regularization through the addition of a penalty
term to the objective function. Especially with complex missing data patterns using the
nuclear norm as the regularizer is attractive for computational reasons.
In the current paper we make two contributions. First, we generalize the methods from
the matrix completion literature to settings where the missing data patterns are not completely at random. In particular we allow for the possibility of staggered adoption (Athey
and Imbens (2018)), where units are treated from some initial adoption date onwards,
but the adoption dates vary between units. Compared to the factor model literature the
proposed estimator focuses on nuclear norm regularization to avoid the computational difficulties that would arise for complex missing data patterns with the fixed-rank methods in
Bai and Ng (2002) and Xu (2017), similar to the way LASSO (`1 regularization, Tibshirani
(1996)) is computationally attractive relative to subset selection (`0 regularization) in linear
regression models. The second contribution is to show that the synthetic control and unconfoundedness approaches, as well as our proposed method, can all be viewed as matrix
3

completion methods based on matrix factorization, all with the same objective function
based on the Fröbenius norm for the difference between the latent matrix and the observed
matrix. Given this common objective function the unconfoundedness and synthetic control
approaches impose different sets of restrictions on the factors in the matrix factorization,
whereas the proposed method does not impose any restrictions but uses regularization to
define the estimator.

Set Up

Consider an N × T matrix Y of outcomes with typical element Yit . We only observe Yit
for some units and some time periods. We define M to be the set of pairs of indices (i, t),
i ∈ {1, . . . , N }, t ∈ {1, . . . , T }, corresponding to the missing entries and O to be the set
corresponding to the observed entries: Yit is missing if (i, t) ∈ M and observed if (i, t) ∈ O.
We wish to impute the missing Yit . Our motivation for this problem arises from a causal
potential outcome setting (e.g., Rubin (1974); Imbens and Rubin (2015)), where for each
of N units and T time periods there exists a pair of potential outcomes, Yit (0) and Yit (1),
with unit i exposed in period t to treatment Wit ∈ {0, 1}, and the realized outcome equal
to Yit = Yit (Wit ). In that case the primary object of interest may be the average causal
P
effect of the treatment, τ = i,t [Yit (1) − Yit (0)]/(N T ), or some other average treatment
effect. In order to estimate such average treatment effects, one approach is to impute the
missing potential outcomes. In this paper we focus directly on the problem of imputing
the missing entries in the Y(0) matrix for treated units with Wit = 1.
In addition to partially observing the matrix Y, we may also observe covariate matrices
X ∈ RN ×P and Z ∈ RT ×Q where columns of X are unit-specific covariates, and columns of
Z are time-specific covariates. We may also observe unit/time specific covariates Vit ∈ RJ .
Putting aside the covariates for the time being, the data can be thought of as consisting

Patterns of Missing Data, Thin and Fat Matrices,
and Horizontal and Vertical Regression

In this section, we discuss a number of particular configurations of the matrices Y and W
that are the focus of distinct parts of the general literature. This serves to put in context
the problem, and to motivate previously developed methods from the literature on causal
inference under unconfoundedness, the synthetic control literature, and the interactive fixed
effect literature, and subsequently to develop formal connections between all three. First,
we consider patterns of missing data. Second, we consider different shapes of the matrix
Y. Third, we consider a number of specific analyses that focus on particular combinations
of missing data patterns and shapes of the matrices.

3.1

Patterns of Missing Data

In the statistics literature on matrix completion the focus is on settings with randomly missing values, allowing for general patterns on the matrix of missing data indicators (Candès
and Tao (2010); Recht (2011)). In many social science applications, however, there is a
specific structure on the missing data.
3.1.1

Block Structure

A leading example is a block structure, with a subset of the units treated during every
period from a particular point in time T0 onwards.

There are two special cases of the block structure. Much of the literature on estimating
average treatment effects under unconfoundedness focuses on the case where T0 = T , so
that the only treated units are in the last period. We will refer to this as the single-treatedperiod block structure. In contrast, the synthetic control literature focuses on the case
of with a single treated unit which are treated for a number of periods from period T0

Staggered Adoption

Another setting that has received attention is characterized by staggered adoption of the
treatment (Athey and Imbens (2018)). Here units may differ in the time they are first
exposed to the treatment, but once exposed they remain in the treatment group forever
after. This naturally arises in settings where the treatment is some new technology that
units can choose to adopt (e.g., Athey and Stern (2002)). Here:

Thin and Fat Matrices

A second classification concerns the shape of the matrix Y. Relative to the number of
time periods, we may have many units, few units, or a comparable number. These data
configurations may make particular analyses more attractive. For example, Y may be a
thin matrix, with N  T , or a fat matrix, with N  T , or an approximately square
matrix, with N ≈ T :

Horizontal and Vertical Regressions

Two special combinations of missing data patterns and the shape of the matrices deserve
particular attention because they are the focus of substantial separate literatures.

8

3.3.1

Horizontal Regression and the Unconfoundedness Literature

The unconfoundedness literature focuses primarily on the single-treated-period block structure with a thin matrix, and imputes the missing potential outcomes in the last period using
control units with similar lagged outcomes. A simple version of that approach is to regress
the last period outcome on the lagged outcomes and use the estimated regression to predict the missing potential outcomes. That is, for the units with (i, T ) ∈ M, the predicted
outcome is

ŶiT = β̂0 +

T −1
X

β̂s Yis , where β̂ = arg min
β

s=1

X

YiT − β0 −

T −1
X

!2
βs Yis

.

(3.1)

s=1

i:(i,T )∈O

We refer to this as a horizontal regression, where the rows of the Y matrix form the units
of observation. A more flexible, nonparametric, version of this estimator would correspond
to matching where we find for each treated unit i a corresponding control unit j with Yjt
approximately equal to Yit for all pre-treatment periods t = 1, . . . , T − 1.
3.3.2

Vertical Regression and the Synthetic Control Literature

The synthetic control literature focuses primarily on the single-treated-unit block structure
with a fat or approximately square matrix. Doudchenko and Imbens (2016) discuss how
the Abadie-Diamond-Hainmueller synthetic control method can be interpreted as regressing
the outcomes for the treated unit prior to the treatment on the outcomes for the control
units in the same periods. That is, for the treated unit in period t, for t = T0 , . . . , T , the
predicted outcome is

ŶN t = γ̂0 +

γ̂i Yit , where γ̂ = arg min

X
t:(N,t)∈O

9

YN t − γ0 −

N

X
i=1

!2
γi Yit

.

(3.2)

We refer to this as a vertical regression, where the columns of the Y matrix form the units
of observation. As shown in Doudchenko and Imbens (2016) this is a special case of the
Abadie et al. (2015) estimator, without imposing their restrictions that the coefficients are
nonnegative and that the intercept is zero.
Although this does not appear to have been pointed out previously, a matching version
of this estimator would correspond to finding, for each period t where unit N is treated, a
corresponding period s ∈ {1, . . . , T0 − 1} such that Yis is approximately equal to YN s for
all control units i = 1, . . . , N − 1. This matching version of the synthetic control estimator
clarifies the link between the treatment effect literature under unconfoundedness and the
synthetic control literature.
Suppose that the only missing entry is in the last period for unit N . In that case if we
estimate the horizontal regression in (3.1), it is still the case that imputed ŶN T is linear
in the observed Y1T , . . . , YN −1,T , just with different weights than those obtained from the
vertical regression. Similarly, if we estimate the vertical regression in (3.2), it is still the
case that ŶN T is linear in YN 1 , . . . , YN,T −1 , just with different weights from the horizontal
regression.

3.4

Fixed Effects and Factor Models

The horizontal regression focuses on a pattern in the time path of the outcome Yit , specifically the relation between YiT and the lagged Yit for t = 1, . . . , T −1, for the units for whom
these values are observed, and assumes that this pattern is the same for units with missing
outcomes. The vertical regression focuses on a pattern between units at times when we
observe all outcomes, and assumes this pattern continues to hold for periods when some
outcomes are missing. However, by focusing on only one of these patterns, cross-section
or time series, these approaches ignore alternative patterns that may help in imputing the

10

missing values. An alternative is to consider approaches that allow for the exploitation of
both stable patterns over time, and stable patterns accross units. Such methods have a
long history in the panel data literature, including the literature on fixed effects, and more
generally, factor and interactive fixed effect models (e.g., Chamberlain (1984); Arellano and
Honoré (2001); Liang and Zeger (1986); Bai (2003, 2009); Pesaran (2006); Moon and Weidner (2015, 2017)). In the absence of covariates (although in this literature the coefficients
on these covariates are typically the primary focus of the analyses), such models can be
written as
Yit =

R
X

or Y = UV> + ε,

γir δtr + εit ,

(3.3)

r=1

where U is N × R and V is T × R. Most of the early literature, Anderson (1958) and
Goldberger (1972)), focused on the thin matrix case, with N  T , where asymptotic
approximations are based on letting the number of units increase with the number of time
periods fixed. In the modern part of this literature (Bai (2003, 2009); Pesaran (2006);
Moon and Weidner (2015, 2017); Bai and Ng (2017)) researchers allow for more complex
asymptotics with both N and T increasing, at rates that allow for consistent estimation of
the factors V and loadings U after imposing normalizations. In this literature it is typically
assumed that the number of factors R is fixed, although not necessarily known. Methods
for estimating the rank R are discussed in Bai and Ng (2002) and Moon and Weidner
(2015).
Xu (2017) implements this interactive fixed effect approach to the matrix completion
problem in the special case with blocked assignment, with additional applications in Gobillon and Magnac (2013); Kim and Oka (2014) and Hsiao et al. (2012). Suppose the first NC
units are in the control group, and the last NT = N − NC units are in the treatment group.
The treatment group is exposed to the control treatment in the first T0 − 1 pre-treatment
periods, and exposed to the active treatment in the post-treatment periods T0 , . . . , T . In
11

that case we can partition U and V accordingly and write

UV> = 

UC
UT




Vpre
Vpost

>
 .

Using the data from the control group pre and post, and the pre data only for the treatment
group, we have

YC = UC 

Vpre
Vpost

>
>
+ εT,pre
and YT,pre = UT Vpre

 + εC ,

where the first equation can be used to estimate UC , Vpre , and Vpost , and the second is
used to estimate UT , both by least squares after normalizing U and V. Note that this is
not necessarily efficient, because YT,pre is not used to estimate Vpre .
Independently, a closely related literature has emerged in machine learning and statistics on matrix completion (Srebro et al. (2005); Candès and Recht (2009); Candès and
Tao (2010); Keshavan et al. (2010a,b); Gross (2011); Recht (2011); Rohde et al. (2011);
Negahban and Wainwright (2011, 2012); Koltchinskii et al. (2011); Klopp (2014)). In this
literature the starting point is an incompletely observed matrix, and researchers have proposed matrix-factorization approaches to matrix completion, similar to (3.3). The focus
is not on estimating U and V consistently, only on imputing the missing elements of Y.
Instead of fixing the rank of the underlying matrix, estimators rely on regularization, and
in particular nuclear norm regularization.

12

4

The Nuclear Norm Matrix Completion Estimator

In the absence of covariates we model the N × T matrix of outcomes Y as
Y = L∗ + ε,

where

E[ε|L∗ ] = 0 .

(4.1)

The εit can be thought of as measurement error. The goal is to estimate the matrix L∗ .
To facilitate the characterization of the estimator, define for any matrix A, and given
a set of pairs of indices O, the two matrices PO (A) and P⊥
O (A) with typical elements:

 A
it
PO (A)it =
 0

if (i, t) ∈ O ,
if (i, t) ∈
/ O,


 0
⊥
and PO (A)it =
 Ait

if (i, t) ∈ O ,
if (i, t) ∈
/ O.

A critical role is played by various matrix norms, summarized in Table 1. Some of these
depend on the singular values, where, given the full Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
LN ×T = SN ×N ΣN ×T R>
T ×T , the singular values σi (L) are the ordered diagonal elements of
Σ.

the problem by adding a penalty term λkLk, for some choice of the norm k · k.

studied by Mazumder et al. (2010), with the penalty factor λ chosen through crossvalidation that will be described at the end of this section. We will call this the MatrixCompletion with Nuclear Norm Minimization (MC-NNM) estimator.
Other commonly used Schatten norms would not work as well for this specific problem.
For example, the Fröbenius norm on the penalty term would not have been suitable for
estimating L∗ in the case with missing entries because the solution for Lit for (i, t) ∈ M is
P
always zero (which follows directly from the representation of kLkF = i,t L2it ). The rank
norm is not computationally feasible for large N and T if the cardinality and complexity
of the set M are substantial. Formally, the problem is NP-hard. In contrast, a major
advantage of using the nuclear norm is that the resulting estimator can be computed using
fast convex optimization programs, e.g. the SOFT-IMPUTE algorithm by Mazumder et al.
(2010) that will be described next.
Calculating the Estimator: The algorithm for calculating our estimator (in the case
without additional covariates) goes as follows. Given the SVD for A, A = SΣR> , with

14

singular values σ1 (A), . . . , σmin(N,T ) (A), define the matrix shrinkage operator
shrinkλ (A) = SΣ̃R> ,

(4.4)

where Σ̃ is equal to Σ with the i-th singular value σi (A) replaced by max(σi (A) − λ, 0).

until the sequence {Lk (λ, O)}k≥1 converges. The limiting matrix L̂(λ, O) = limk→∞ Lk (λ, O)
is our estimator given the regularization parameter λ.
Cross-validation: The optimal value of λ is selected through cross-validation. We choose
K (e.g., K = 5) random subsets Ok ⊂ O with cardinality b|O|2 /N T c to ensure that the
fraction of observed data in the cross-validation data sets, |Ok /|O|, is equal to that in
the original sample, |O|/(N T ). We then select a sequence of candidate regularization
parameters λ1 > · · · > λL = 0, with a large enough λ1 , and for each subset Ok calculate
L̂(λ1 , Ok ), . . . , L̂(λL , Ok ) and evaluate the average squared error on O \ Ok . The value of λ
that minimizes the average squared error (among the K produced estimators corresponding
to that λ) is the one chosen. It is worth noting that one can expedite the computation by
using L̂(λi , Ok ) as a warm-start initialization for calculating L̂(λi+1 , Ok ) for each i and k.

Theoretical Bounds for the Estimation Error

In this section we focus on the case that there are no covariates and provide theoretical
results for the estimation error. Let Lmax be a positive constant such that kL∗ kmax ≤ Lmax
(recall that kL∗ kmax = maxi,t |L∗it |). We also assume that L∗ is a deterministic matrix.

Additional Notation

First, we start by introduction some new notation. For each positive integer n let [n] be
the set of integers {1, 2, . . . , n}. In addition, for any pair of integers i, n with i ∈ [n] define
ei (n) to be the n dimensional column vector with all of its entries equal to 0 except the
ith entry that is equal to 1. In other words, {e1 (n), e2 (n), . . . , en (n)} forms the standard
basis for Rn . For any two matrices A, B of the same dimensions define the inner product
hA, Bi ≡ trace(A> B). Note that with this definition, hA, Ai = kAk2F .
Next, we describe a random observation process that defines the set O. Consider N
independent random variables t1 , . . . , tN on [T ] with distributions π (i) . Specifically, for
(i)

each (i, t) ∈ [N ] × [T ], define πt

≡ P[ti = t]. We also use the short notation Eπ when

taking expectation with respect to all distributions π (1) , . . . , π (N ) . Now, O can be written
o
S n
as O = N
(i,
1),
(i,
2),
.
.
.
,
(i,
t
)
.
i
i=1
Also, for each (i, t) ∈ O, we use the notation Ait to refer to ei (N )et (T )> which is a N
by T matrix with all entries equal to zero except the (i, t) entry that is equal to 1. The
data generating model can now be written as
Yit = hAit , L∗ i + εit ,

∀ (i, t) ∈ O ,

where noise variables εit are independent σ-sub-Gaussian random variables that are also
independent of Ait . Recall that a random variable ε is σ-sub-Gaussian if for all real numbers
t we have E[exp(tε)] ≤ exp(σ 2 t2 /2).
Note that the number of control units (Nc ) is equal to the number of rows that have all
16

entries observed (i.e., Nc =

PN

can be written as Eπ [Nc ] =

PN

i=1 Iti =T ). Therefore,
(i)
i=1 πT . Defining

the expected number of control units

(i)

pc ≡ min πT ,
1≤i≤N

we expect to have (on average) at least N pc control units. The parameter pc will play an
important role in our main theoretical results. Specifically, assuming N and T are of the
√
same order, we will show that the average per entry error (i.e., kL̂−L∗ kF / N T ) converges
√
to 0 if pc grows larger than log3/2 (N )/ N up to a constant. To provide some intuition
for such assumption on pc , assume L∗ is a matrix that is zero everywhere except in its ith
row. Such L∗ is clearly low-rank. But recovering the entry L∗iT is impossible when it < T .
(i)

Therefore, πT cannot be too small. Since i is arbitrary, in general pc cannot be too small.
Remark 5.1. It is worth noting that the sources of randomness in our observation process
O are the random variables {ti }N
i=1 that are assumed to be independent of each other. But
we allow that distributions of these random variables to be functions of L∗ . We also assume
that the noise variables {εit }it∈[N ]×[T ] are independent of each other and are independent
of {ti }N
i=1 . In §8 we discuss how our results could generalize to the cases with correlations
among these noise variables.
Remark 5.2. The estimator (5.1) penalizes the error terms (Yit − Lit )2 , for (i, t) ∈ O,
equally. But the ex ante probability of missing entries in each row, the propensity score, increases as t increases. In §8.3, we discuss how the estimator can be modified by considering
a weighted loss function based on propensity scores for the missing entries.

Main Result

The main result of this section is the following theorem (proved in §A.1) that provides an
√
upper bound for kL∗ − L̂kF / N T , the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of the estimator
L̂. In literature on theoretical analysis of empirical risk minimization this type of upper
bound is called an oracle inequality.

Interpretation of Theorem 1: In order to see when the RMSE of L̂ converges to zero
as N and T grow, we note that the right hand side of (5.2) converges to 0 when L∗ is
p
low-rank (R is constant) and pc  log3/2 (N + T )/ min(N, T ). A sufficient condition for
the latter, when N and T are of the same order, is that the lower bound for the average
√
number of control units (N pc ) grows larger than a constant times N log3/2 (N ). In §8 we
will discuss how the estimator L̂ should be modified to obtain a sharper result that would
hold for a smaller number of control units.
Comparison with existing theory on matrix-completion: Our estimator and its
theoretical analysis are motivated by and generalize existing research on matrix-completion
Srebro et al. (2005); Mazumder et al. (2010); Candès and Recht (2009); Candès and Tao
(2010); Keshavan et al. (2010a,b); Gross (2011); Recht (2011); Rohde et al. (2011); Negahban and Wainwright (2011, 2012); Koltchinskii et al. (2011); Klopp (2014). The main

18

difference is in our observation model O. Existing papers assume that entries (i, t) ∈ O
are independent random variables whereas we allow for a dependency structure including
staggered adoption where if (i, t) ∈ O then (i, t0 ) ∈ O for all t0 < t.

The Relationship with Horizontal and Vertical Regressions

In the second contribution of this paper we discuss the relation between the matrix completion estimator and the horizontal (unconfoundedness) and vertical (synthetic control)
approaches. To faciliate the discussion, we focus on the case with M containing a single
pair, unit N in period T , M = {(N, T )}. In that case the various previously proposed
versions of the vertical and horizontal regressions are both directly applicable, although
estimating the coefficients may require regularization.
The observed data are Y, an N × T matrix that can be partitioned as

Y=


,

where Ỹ is (N − 1) × (T − 1), y1 is (N − 1) × 1, and y2 is (T − 1) × 1.
The matrix completion solution to imputing YN T can be characterized, for a given
regularization parameter λ, as

We can modify the horizontal regression in the same way to allow for restrictions on the

The regularization in the elastic net version only affects the last row of this matrix, and
replaces it with a regularized version of the regression coefficients. 
Comment 3. The horizontal and vertical regressions are fundamentally different approaches, and they cannot easily be nested. Without some form of regularization they
cannot be applied in the same setting, because the non-regularized versions require N > T
or N < T respectively. As a result there is also no direct way to test the two methods
against each other. Given a particular choice for regularization, however, one can use
cross-validation methods to compare the two approaches. 

Two Illustrations

The objective of this section is to compare the accuracy of imputation for the matrix
completion method with previously used methods. In particular, in a real data matrix Y
where no unit is treated (no entries in the matrix are missing), we choose a subset of units
as hypothetical treated units and aim to predict their values (for time periods following
a randomly selected initial time). Then, we report the average root-mean-squared-error
(RMSE) of each algorithm on values for the pseudo-treated (time, period) pairs. In these
cases there is not necessarily a single right algorithm. Rather, we wish to assess which of
the algorithms generally performs well, and which ones are robust to a variety of settings,
including different adoption regimes and different configurations of the data.
We compare the following estimators:
• DID: Difference-in-differences based on regressing the observed outcomes on unit and
time fixed effects and a dummy for the treatment.
• VT-EN: The vertical regression with elastic net regularization, relaxing the restrictions from the synthetic control estimator.
• HR-EN: The horizontal regression with elastic net regularization, similar to unconfoundedness type regressions.
• SC-ADH: The original synthetic control approach by Abadie et al. (2010), based on
the vertical regression with Abadie-Diamond-Hainmueller restrictions.
• MC-NNM: Our proposed matrix completion approached via nuclear norm minimization, explained in Section 2 above.
The comparison between MC-NNM and the two versions of the elastic net estimator,
HR-EN and VT-EN, is particularly salient. In much of the literature researchers choose
25

ex ante between vertical and horizontal type regressions. The MC-NNM method allows
one to sidestep that choice in a data-driven manner.

7.1

The Abadie-Diamond-Hainmueller California Smoking Data

We use the control units from the California smoking data studied in Abadie et al. (2010)
with N = 38, T = 31. Note that in the original data set there are 39 units but one of them
(state of California) is treated which will be removed in this section since the untreated
values for that unit are not available. We then artificially designate some units and time
periods to be treated, and compare predicted values for those unit/time-periods to the
actual values.
We consider two settings for the treatment adoption:
• Case 1: Simultaneous adoption where Nt units adopt the treatment in period T0 + 1,
and the remaining units never adopt the treatment.
• Case 2: Staggered adoption where Nt units adopt the treatment in some period after
period T , with the actual adoption date varying among these units.
In each case, the average RMSE for different ratios T0 /T is reported in Figure 1. For
clarity of the figures, for each T0 /T , while all confidence intervals of various methods are
calculated using the same ratio T0 /T , in the figure they are slightly jittered to the left or
right. In the simultaneous adoption case, DID generally does poorly, suggesting that the
data are rich enough to support more complex models. For small values of T0 /T , SC-ADH
and HR-EN perform poorly while VT-EN is superior. As T0 /T grows closer to one, VTEN, HR-EN, SC-ADH and MC-NNM methods all do well. The staggered adoption results
are similar with some notable differences; VT-EN performs poorly (similar to DID) and
MC-NNM is the superior approach. The performance improvement of MC-NNM can be
attributed to its use of additional observations (pre-treatment values of treatment units).

Stock Market Data

In the next illustration we use a financial data set – daily returns for 2453 stocks over 10
years (3082 days). Since we only have access to a single instance of the data, in order to
observe statistical fluctuations of the RMSE, for each N and T we create 50 sub-samples
by looking at the first T daily returns of N randomly sampled stocks for a range of pairs of
(N, T ), always with N × T = 4900, ranging from very thin to very fat, (N, T ) = (490, 10),
. . . (N, T ) = (70, 70), . . . (N, T ) = (10, 490), with in each case the second half the entries
missing for a randomly selected half the units (so 25% of the entries missing overall), in
a block design. Here we focus on the comparison between the HR-EN, VT-EN, and
MC-NNM estimators as the shape of the matrix changes. We report the average RMSE.
Figure 2 shows the results.

27

Figure 2: Stock Market Data

In the T  N case the VT-EN estimator does poorly, not surprisingly because it
attempts to do the vertical regression with too few time periods to estimate that well.
When N  T , the HR-EN estimator does poorly. The most interesting finding is that
the proposed MC-NNM method adapts well to both regimes and does as well as the best
estimator in both settings, and better than both in the approximately square setting.
The bottom graph in Figure 2 shows that MC-NNM approximates the data with a
matrix of rank 4 to 12, where smaller ranks are used as N grows relative to T . This
validates the fact that there is a stronger correlation between daily return of different
stocks than between returns for different time periods of the same stock.

Generalizations

Here we provide a brief discussion on how our estimator and its analysis should be adapted
to more general settings.

8.1

The Model with Covariates

In Section 2 we described the basic model, and discussed the specification and estimation
for the case without covariates. In this section we extend that to the case with unitspecific, time-specific, and unit-time specific covariates. For unit i we observe a vector of
unit-specific covariates denoted by Xi , and X denoting the N × P matrix of covariates with
ith row equal to Xi> . Similarly, Zt denotes the time-specific covariates for period t, with Z
denoting the T × Q matrix with tth row equal to Zt> . In addition we allow for a unit-time
specific J by 1 vector of covariates Vit .
The model we consider is
Yit =

L∗it

+

Q
P X
X

∗
Xip Hpq
Zqt + γi∗ + δt∗ + Vit> β ∗ + εit .

(8.1)

p=1 q=1

the εit is random noise. We are interested in estimating the unknown parameters L∗ , H∗ ,
γ ∗ , δ ∗ and β ∗ . This model allows for traditional econometric fixed effects for the units (the
γi∗ ) and time effects (the δt∗ ). It also allows for fixed covariate (these have time varying
coefficients) and time covariates (with individual coefficients) and time varying individual
covariates. Note that although we can subsume the unit and time fixed effects into the
matrix L∗ , we do not do so because we regularize the estimates of L∗ , but do not wish to
regularize the estimates of the fixed effects.

29

The model can be rewritten as
 > ∗
∗ >
Y = L∗ + XH∗ Z> + Γ∗ 1>
T + 1N (∆ ) + Vit β it + ε .

(8.2)

Here L∗ is in RN ×T , H∗ is in RP ×Q , Γ∗ is in RN ×1 and ∆∗ is in RT ×1 . An slightly richer
version of this model that allows linear terms in covariates can be defined as by
 > ∗
∗ >
Y = L∗ + X̃H̃∗ Z̃> + Γ∗ 1>
T + 1N (∆ ) + Vit β it + ε

(8.3)

where X̃ = [X|IN ×N ], Z̃ = [Z|IT ×T ], and

H̃∗ = 

H∗X,Z H∗X

where H∗XZ ∈ RP ×Q , H∗Z ∈ RN ×Q , and H∗X ∈ RP ×T . In particular,
 > ∗
∗ >
Y = L∗ + X̃H̃∗X,Z Z̃> + H̃∗Z Z̃> + XH̃∗X + Γ∗ 1>
T + 1N (∆ ) + Vit β it + ε

(8.4)

From now on, we will use the richer model (8.4) but abuse the notation and use notation
X, H∗ , Z instead of X̃, H̃∗ , Z̃. Therefore, the matrix H∗ will be in R(N +P )×(T +Q) .
We estimate H∗ , L∗ , δ ∗ , γ ∗ , and β ∗ by solving the following convex program,

|Hit | is the element-wise `1 norm. We choose λL and λH through

cross-validation.
Solving this convex program is similar to the covariate-free case. In particular, by using
30

a similar operator to shrinkλ , defined in §2, that performs coordinate descent with respect
to H. Then we can apply this operator after each step of using shrinkλ . Coordinate descent
with respect to γ, δ, and β is performed similarly but using a simpler operation since the
function is smooth with respect to them.

8.2

Autocorrelated Errors

One drawback of MC-NNM is that it does not take into account the time series nature of
the observations. It is likely that the columns of ε exhibit autocorrelation. We can take this
into account by modifying the objective function. Let us consider this in the case without
covariates, and, for illustrative purposes, let us use an autoregressive model of order one.
Let Yi· and Li· be the ith row of Y and L respectively. The original objective function for
O = [N ] × [T ] is

i=1 (Yi· −Li· )Ω (Yi· −Li· ) /|O|+λL kLk∗ ,

where the choice for the

T × T matrix Ω would reflect the autocorrelation in the εit . For example, with a first order
autoregressive process, we would use Ωts = ρ|t−s| , with ρ an estimate of the autoregressive
coefficient. Similarly, for the more general version O ⊂ [N ] × [T ], we can use the function

8.3

Weighted Loss Function

Another limitation of MC-NNM is that it puts equal weight on all observed elements of the
difference Y − L (ignoring the covariates). Ultimately we care solely about predictions of
31

the model for the missing elements of Y, and for that reason it is natural to emphasize the
fit of the model for elements of Y that are observed, but that are similar to the elements
that are missing. In the program evaluation literature this is often achieved by weighting
the fit by the propensity score, the probability of outcomes for a unit being missing.
We can do so in the current setting by modelling this probability in terms of the covariates and a latent factor structure. Let the propensity score be eit = P(Wit = 1|Xi , Zt , Vit ),
and let E be the N × T matrix with typical element eit . Let us again consider the case
without covariates. In that case we may wish to model the assignment W as

Relaxing the Dependence of Theorem 1 on pc

P
(i)
Recall from §5.1 that the average number of control units is N
i=1 πT . Therefore, the fracP
(i)
tion of control units is N
i=1 πT /N . However, the estimation error in Theorem 1 depends
P
(i)
(i)
on pc = min1≤i≤N πT rather than N
i=1 πT /N . The reason for this, as discussed in §5.1 is
due to special classes of matrices L∗ where most of the rows are nearly zero (e.g, when only
one row is non-zero). In order to relax this constraint we would need to restrict the family
32

of matrices L∗ . An example of such restriction is given by Negahban and Wainwright (2012)
where they assume L∗ is not too spiky. Formally, they assume the ratio kL∗ kmax /kL∗ kF
√
should be of order 1/ N T up to logarithmic terms. To see the intuition for this, in a
√
matrix with all equal entries this ratio is 1/ N T whereas in a matrix where only the (1, 1)
entry is non-zero the ratio is 1. While both matrices have rank 1, in the former matrix the
value of kL∗ kF is obtained from most of the entries. In such situations, one can extend our
P
(i)
results and obtain an upper bound that depends on N
i=1 πT /N .

8.5

Nearly Low-rank Matrices

Another possible extension of Theorem 1 is to the cases where L∗ may have high rank, but
most of its singular values are small. More formally, if σ1 ≥ · · · > σmin(N,T ) are singular
Pmin(N,T )
values of L∗ , one can obtain upper bounds that depend on k and r=k+1 σr for any
k ∈ [min(N, T )]. One can then optimize the upper bound by selecting the best k. In the
low-rank case such optimization leads to selecting k equal to R. This type of more general
upper bound has been proved in some of prior matrix completion literature, e.g. Negahban
and Wainwright (2012). We expect their analyses would be generalize-able to our setting
(when entries of O are not independent).

8.6

Additional Missing Entries

In §5.1 we assumed that all entries (i, t) of Y for t ≤ ti are observed. However, it may be
possible that some such values are missing due to lack of data collection. This does not
mean that any treatment occurred in the pre-treatment period. Rather, such scenario can
occur when measuring outcome values is costly and can be missed. In this case, one can

Conclusions

We present new results for estimation of causal effects in panel or longitudinal data settings.
The proposed estimator, building on the interactive fixed effects and matrix completion literatures has attractive computational properties in settings with large N and T , and allows
for a relatively large number of factors. We show how this set up relates to the program
evaluation and synthetic control literatures. In illustrations we show that the method
adapts well to different configurations of the data, and find that generally it outperforms
the synthetic control estimators from Abadie et al. (2010) and the elastic net estimators
from Doudchenko and Imbens (2016).

Online Appendix for “ Matrix Completion Methods for Causal Panel Data Models”: Proofs

A.1

Proof of Theorem 1

First, we will discuss three main steps that are needed for the proof.
Step 1: We show an upper bound for the sum of squared errors for all (i, t) ∈ O in terms of
P
the regularization parameter λ, rank of L∗ , kL∗ −L̂kF , and kEkop where E ≡ (i,t)∈O εit Ait .
Lemma 1 (Adapted from Negahban and Wainwright (2011)). Then for all λ ≥ 3kEkop /|O|,
X hAit , L∗ − L̂i2
√
≤ 10λ R kL∗ − L̂kF .
|O|

(A.1)

(i,t)∈O

This type of result has been shown before by Recht (2011); Negahban and Wainwright
(2011); Koltchinskii et al. (2011); Klopp (2014). For convenience of the reader, we include
its proof in §A. Similar results also appear in the analysis of LASSO type estimators (for
example see Bühlmann and Van De Geer (2011) and references therein).
Step 2: The upper bound provided by Lemma 1 contains λ and also requires the condition
λ ≥ 3kEkop /|O|. Therefore, in order to have a tight bound, it is important to show an
upper bound for kEkop that holds with high probability. Next lemma provides one such
result.
Lemma 2. There exist a constant C1 such that
kEkop ≤ C1 σ max

i
hp
√
N log(N + T ), T log3/2 (N + T ) ,

39

with probability greater than 1 − (N + T )−2 .
This result uses a concentration inequality for sum of random matrices to find a bound
for kEkop . We note that previous papers, Recht (2011); Negahban and Wainwright (2011);
Koltchinskii et al. (2011); Klopp (2014), contain a similar step but in their case O is
obtained by independently sampling elements of [N ]×[T ]. However, in our case observations
from each row of the matrix are correlated. Therefore, prior results do not apply. In fact,
the correlation structure deteriorates the type of upper bound that can be obtained for
kEkop .
Step 3: The last main step is to show that, with high probability, the random variable on the left hand side of (A.1) is larger than a constant fraction of kL̂ − L∗ k2F . In
high-dimensional statistics literature this property is also referred to as Restricted Strong
Convexity, Negahban et al. (2012); Negahban and Wainwright (2011, 2012). The following
Lemma states this property for our setting and its proof that is similar to the proof of
Theorem 1 in (Negahban and Wainwright, 2012) or Lemma 12 in (Klopp, 2014) is omitted.
Lemma 3. If the estimator L̂ defined above satisfies kL̂ − L∗ kF ≥ κ for a positive number

Now we are equipped to prove the main theorem.
Proof of Theorem 1. Let ∆ = L∗ − L̂. Then using Lemma 2 and selecting λ equal to

Now, we use Lemma 3 to find a lower bound for the left hand side of (A.2). But first note

Proof of Lemma 1

Variants of this Lemma for similar models have been proved before. But for completeness
we include its proof that is adapted from Negahban and Wainwright (2011).

Proof of Lemma 1. Let
f (L) ≡

X (Yit − Lit )2

|O|

(i,t)∈O

Now, using the definition of L̂,
f (L̂) ≤ f (L∗ ) ,
which is equivalent to

(A.6)
(A.7)
(A.8)

Here, (a) uses inequality |hA, Bi| ≤ kAkop kBkmax which is due to the fact that operator
norm is dual norm to nuclear norm, and (b) uses the assumption λ ≥ 3kEkop /|O|. Before
continuing with the proof of Lemma 1 we state the following Lemma that is proved later
in this section.
Lemma 4. Let ∆ ≡ L∗ − L̂ for λ ≥ 3kEkop /|O| Then there exist a decomposition ∆ =
∆1 + ∆2 such that
42

(i) h∆1 , ∆2 i = 0.
(ii) rank(∆1 ) ≤ 2r.
(iii) k∆2 k∗ ≤ 3k∆1 k∗ .
Now, invoking the decomposition ∆ = ∆1 + ∆2 from Lemma 4 and using the triangle
inequality, we obtain
(c)
(d) √
(e) √
k∆k∗ ≤ 4k∆1 k∗ ≤ 4 2rk∆1 kF ≤ 4 2rk∆kF .

(A.9)

where (c) uses Lemma 4(iii), (d) uses Lemma 4(ii) and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and
(e) uses Lemma 4(i). Combining this with (A.8) we obtain
X h∆, Ait i2
√
≤ 10λ r k∆kF ,
|O|

(A.10)

(i,t)∈O

which finishes the proof of Lemma 1.
Proof of Lemma 4. Let L∗ = UN ×r Sr×r (VT ×r )> be the singular value decomposition for
the rank r matrix L∗ . Let PU be the projection operator onto column space of U and let
PU ⊥ be the projection operator onto the orthogonal complement of the column space of U.
Let us recall a few linear algebra facts about these projection operators. If columns of U are
PN
P
>
denoted by u1 , . . . , u0 , since U is unitary, PU = ri=1 ui u>
i . Similarly, PU ⊥ =
i=r+1 ui ui
where u1 , . . . , u0 , ur+1 , . . . , uN forms an orthonormal basis for RN . In addition, the projector
operators are idempotent (i.e., P2U = PU , P2U ⊥ = PU ⊥ ), PU + PU ⊥ = IN ×N .
Define PV and PV ⊥ similarly. Now, we define ∆1 and ∆2 as follows:
∆2 ≡ PU ⊥ ∆PV ⊥

,

43

∆1 ≡ ∆ − ∆2 .

It is easy to see that
∆1 = (PU + PU ⊥ )∆(PV + PV ⊥ ) − PU ⊥ ∆PV ⊥

(A.11)

= PU ∆ + PU ⊥ ∆PV .

(A.12)

Using this fact we have
h∆1 , ∆2 i = trace ∆> PU PU ⊥ ∆PV ⊥ + PV ∆> PU ⊥ PU ⊥ ∆PV ⊥

= trace PV ∆> PU ⊥ ∆PV ⊥

= trace ∆> PU ⊥ ∆PV ⊥ PV = 0



(A.13)
(A.14)
(A.15)

that gives part (i). Note that we used trace(AB) = trace(BA).
Looking at (A.12), part (ii) also follows since both PU and PV have rank r and sum of
two rank r matrices has rank at most 2r.
Before moving to part (iii), we note another property of the above decomposition of
∆ that will be needed next. Since the two matrices L∗ and ∆2 have orthogonal singular
vectors to each other,
kL∗ + ∆2 k∗ = kL∗ k∗ + k∆2 k∗ .

(A.16)

On the other hand, using inequality (A.6), for λ ≥ 3kEkop /|O| we have

λ kL̂k∗ − kL k∗ ≤

44

(A.17)

Now, we can use the following for the left hand side
kL̂k∗ − kL∗ k∗ = kL∗ + ∆1 + ∆2 k∗ − kL∗ k∗
≥ kL∗ + ∆2 k∗ − k∆1 k∗ − kL∗ k∗
(f )

= kL∗ k∗ + k∆2 k∗ − k∆1 k∗ − kL∗ k∗

= k∆2 k∗ − k∆1 k∗ .
Here (f ) follows from (A.16). Now, combining the last inequality with (A.17) we get
k∆2 k∗ − k∆1 k∗ ≤

2
(k∆1 k∗ + k∆2 k∗ ) .
3

That finishes proof of part (iii).

A.3

Proof of Lemma 2

First we state the matrix version of Bernstein inequality for rectangular matrices (see Tropp
(2012) for a derivation of it).
Proposition 1 (Matrix Bernstein Inequality). Let Z1 , . . . , ZN be independent matrices in
Rd1 ×d2 such that E[Zi ] = 0 and kZi kop ≤ D almost surely for all i ∈ [N ] and a constant R.

Note that here we used the fact that random variables ε̄it − E[ε̄it ] are independent of each
other and centered which means all cross terms of the type E{(ε̄it − E[ε̄it ])(ε̄js − E[ε̄js ])}
are zero for (i, t) 6= (j, s). Therefore, σZ2 = 2σ 2 max(N, T ) works. Applying Proposition 1,
we obtain
