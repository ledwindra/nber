Unemployment With Observable Aggregate Shocks

ABS TRACT

Consider an economy subject to two kinds of shocks: (a) an observable
shock to the relative demand for final goods which causes dispersion in
relative prices, and (b) shocks, unobservable by workers, to the technology
for transforming intermediate goods into final goods. A worker in a particular
intermediate goods industry knows that the unobserved price of his output is
determined by (1) the technological shock that determines which final goods
industry uses his output intensively and (2) the price of the final good that
uses his output intensively. When there is very little relative price
dispersion among final goods, then it doesn't matter which final goods industry
uses the worker's output. Thus the technological shock is of very little
importance in creating uncertainty about the worker's marginal product when
there is little dispersion of relative prices. !-Ience an increase in the
dispersion of relative prices amplifies the effect of technological uncertainty
on a worker's marginal value product.
We consider a model of optimal labor contracts in a situation where the
workers have less information than the firm about their marginal value product.
A relative price shock of the type described above increases the uncertainty
which workers have about their marginal value product. We show that with an
optimal asymmetric information employment contract the industries which are
adversely affected by the relative price shock will contract more than they
would under complete information (i.e., where workers could observe their
marginal value product). On the other hand the industry which is favorably
affected by the relative price shock will not expand by more than would be
the case under complete information. Hence an observed relative demand
shock, which would leave aggregate employment unchanged under complete
information, will cause aggregate employment to fall under asymmetric
information about the technological shock.

UNEMPLOYMENT WITH OBSERVABLE AGGREGATE SHOCKS

1. Introduction
Recent theories of the business cycle have emphasized the

misaflocations associated with unobserved aggregate shocks.- Agents
are assumed to have insufficient information to distinguish a change in

their relative position from a change in their absolute position. Here
we develop a model where an aggregate shock (e.g., one which impacts on the price

level, or aggregate unemployment) is observed by everyone. However the
aggregate shock is such that it causes an increase in the uncertainty that

workers have about their marginal value product. We show that this leads

oa fall in employment below what would occur if workers had complete
information.

Azariadis (1982) and Grossman and Hart (1981) have analyzed the
optimal labor contract between a firm

and its workers in a context where

the firm has better information about the real profitability of employment

than the workers. If the owners or manager of the firm

are

risk—averse

optimal risk sharing implies that the firm should cut its wage bill when
it suffers from low

is

profitability.

When

the

firm's profitability, ,

unobservable to the workers, however, there is no way that the wage bill

can be directly tied to s. Instead, it is optimal for the firm and the
worker to agree ex—ante to use employment as a device to induce the firm to

cut wages only when s is low. In particular the firm and worker agree
on a labor contract W(L;n) which ties wages W to employment L, and

—2—

public information n. Let n1 denote a public shock which creates
uncertainty about a particular firm's marginal product of labor. Let
be the situation where the economy suffers no shock and workers have

complete information about their marginal product. In situation n2, the
optimal labor contract will involve setting the marginal wage W'(L;n2)

equal to labor's marginal disutility of effort, say R; while in situation 1
it is optimal to set the marginal wage W'(L,n1) > R

in order to benefit

from risk sharing. This can be shown to imply that total employment will
be lower in situation 1 than in the complete information Walrasian equilibrium.

Consequently shocks which move the economy from n2 to n1 but keep total
employment in the Wairasian equilibrium constant will lower total
employment when there is asymmetric information.

Section 2 reviews the model of an optimal asymmetric information

contract when the economy has only one type of firm. It is shown that
results derived when an individual firm's employment is the only public
information can be extended to situations where any other information not
under the firm's control is made public, as long as that information does
not perfectly reveal the firm's marginal product of labor.
Section 3 presents an introductory model of the above situation
where the economywide shock impacts on the physical productivity of labor.
Workers know only the cross sectional distribution of productivities across

firms which is induced by the shock. For example workers may know that an

oil price shock lowers labor productivity by 75% in half the firms and

raises it by 75% in the other half of firms. However a given worker does
not know which half his firm is in. We show that the relatively lucky

—3—

firms

do not increase employment by more than they would if their workers

had perfect information, while the unlucky firms decrease their employment

by more than they would if the workers had perfect information. Thus
total employment falls by more than in a Walrasian equilibrium, as a
consequence of an increase in the cross sectional dispersion of productivities.
Our basic principle is that the only thing that workers can observe is the

cross sectional distribution of marginal products. They use this to make
an inference about their own marginal product, assuming that their own

value is a random drawing from that distribution. Hence an increase in the
dispersion of productivities across firms makes workers more uncertain

about their own productivity. We are trying to model the idea that workers
know how the total demand for labor varies with the observed shock, but not
how their own firm's demand for labor is affected by the shock.

Section 4 is the heart of the paper. An economy is considered where
there are 3 final consumption goods of which 2 are produced out of
intermediate goods, and the third is not produced using current resources

(e.g. real balances or the real value of the capital stock). The 2 final

produced goods X and Y are made from two intermediate goods K1 an
K2. The economy is subjected to two types of shocks only one of which is
observable by workers. First, the distribution of endowed wealth changes,

which changes the demand for the final goods X and '.

This results in

an observable change in the prices of the final goods. Second, there are
shocks 0, to the technology of transforming intermediate goods into final
goods. These shocks are not observed by workers, and change the intensity

—4—

with which a particular final goods industry uses each intermediate good.
Workers only produce intermediate goods, but do not observe intermediate
goods prices.

When workers in a particular intermediate goods firm, say 1, observe

a shock to the relative prices of X and Y, say which raises P

and

lowers P, they do not know how that affects the value of their marginal

value product because they do not know whether X or Y is intensively
using the output K1 which they produce. Note however when relative prices
are not very dispersed, it does not matter as far as the workers' marginal

value product is concerned whether X or Y is using K1 intensively.
We are thus able to derive a model where an observed increase in the
dispersion of relative final goods prices causes an increase in the uncertainty

workers have about their own marginal value product. That is, when workers
observe the prices of the goods they consume but not the prices of the goods
they produce, then an increase in the dispersion of observed consumption goods
prices will increase the uncertainty workers have about the prices of the

goods they produce. This model where workers know more about general economy
conditions than about the conditions in their own industry is the reverse of
Lucas' (1972) assumption that workers know more about their own firm's price
than they know about the economy wide price level.

Using the results of Sections 2 and 3, Section 4 shows that an increase

in the dispersion of relative prices which would leave the complete
information Wairasian equilibrium unchanged, causes a fall in employment under

the above asymmetric information situation. This is proved under the
assumption that ex ante ,

workers and firms write an optimal labor contract

—5—
which apnropriately conditions on everything which will be observable

to both parties. Therefore, the contractionary effect of aggregate shocks
occurs despite the fact that contracts are conditioned on these shocks.
This is in contrast to models such as Taylor (1980) or Blanchard (1979)

where observable shocks affect output because wage contracts could not
be conditioned on those shocks.

Section 5 contains our interpretations, conclusions and some references

to evidence. In particular we suggest the importance of publicly observed
but unanticipated changes in the price level (or rate of inflation) in a

monetary economy. When a large percentage of individual wealth is held in
the form of nominally denominated assets or liabilities, then changes in
the price level will case a redistribution of wealth between nominal

borrowers and nominal lenders. This wealth redistribution can be the source
of shocks to the relative demands for goods if borrowers and lenders have

different tastes. Output can contract as a consequence of the relative
price dispersion created by the wealth redistribution. A wealth redistribution
which would have no effect on total employment when agents have symmetric

information, will cause employment to fall when they are asyinmetrially
informed.

2. The Optimal Employment Contract
We begin by analyzing the optimal contract between a single firm

and its workers. It is convenient to begin without distinguishing physical
productivity shocks from relative demand shocks. Thus we let

be

the random variable which is the source of variability in the marginal

value product of labor, i.e., output q is given by

q =

(2.1)

where

sf()

is total employment at the firm and f( )

is

a strictly

concave differentiable production function. It is useful to consider

q as "real

output".

In order to analyze the effect of public information on the
optimal

employment contract, we make the following conventions: There is

an initial date 0 at which time the firm and worker have the same

information, and neither party knows s. At date 1 the firm observes
s and the workers do not. However the workers observe a signal n
which gives them some information about s. The firm also observes n

at date 1. The firm chooses Q at date 1 after it observes n and
s. The workers observe 2,

so that the total wage bill w can be

made a function of both n and 9. We assume tI-tat q is not observed

by the workers, so that n and
on which wages can be conditioned.

are the only pieces of information

—7—

We assume that labor is supplied perfectly elastically at a real

wage rate of R per unit at date 1, i.e., we assume that a worker's

utility of real income I and labor is given by U(I—Ri) where U is
concave. We let U0 be the expected utility as of time 0 that a worker
can get if he does not work at the particular firm which we are considering.
It is notationally convenient to assume that there is only one potential

worker for this firm. In Grossman and Hart [1981, p.304] we showed that
all real values are unaffected if there are many workers and the firm can
give layoff pay to those workers who are laid off.

An optimal contract involves a wage rule w(i,n) and an
employment rule 2(s,n) which maximizes the firm's expected utility
subject to the worker's expected utility being at least as large as U0.

Note that since s is not directly observable to the worker, the
contract must make it optimal for the firm to actually choose P(s,n)

and w(i,n) when the true state is s. This will be true if for each

sf((s,) -

(2.2)

That

w((s,n), > sf()

-

is, Q(s,n) is the employment rule induced by the wage contract

For reasons explained in Grossman and Hart [l981i982] we assume

that

the owners of the firm are risk averse and have a utility of profit

V(q—w), where V is strictly concave. Thus an optimal contract is

w(i,n), i(s,a) which

(2.3) maximizes E v(f(P(,ii)) —

>TJ0.

Note that the expectation is with respect to the joint distribution of

and

which is assumed to be known to both the firm and worker at

time 0. We are using a tilde over a variable to signify that it is a
random variable.

It is convenient to define the complete information employment

rule. If s were observed by the worker then an optimal employment
contract would involve setting the marginal product of labor equal to the

marginal disutility of effort R, and choosing the wage bill so that risk
is optimally shared between the firm

and workers. We denote this complete

In Grossman—Hart (1981) we showed that when the worker has no

information i

about the realization of , then the optimal contract will

involve an employment function Z(s) which is everywhere below £*(s). We
now show the results of that paper can be applied to the situation here

where workers can observe n at time 1.

QED

The idea behind the Proposition is as follows. We can imagine

that at time 1 the worker and firm observe the realization of i before
the firm observes the realization of .

Given that ii = n, this induces a

conditional probability distribution on , say

F(sln). We then imagine

that the firm and worker reopen their contract and negotiate an employment

and wage rule which maximizes the firm's expected utility conditional on

the information n, and which gives the worker a value of conditional

expected utility 13(n) which was preassigned at time 0. This contract
is for each n exactly like the one in Grossman—Hart (1981).

A simple example is one where i takes on two possible values n , and

since there is no uncertainty. On the other hand when n = a,

we can appeal to Grossman—Hart [l98l,p.305] to state that if V" < 0
*

then P(s,nb) < 9 (s) for almost all

s c {s,s) and 2(s,nb) =

£*(s,n,0).

That

is, as long as s is not the highest possible, the optimal contract will with
probability one involve an employment level strictly less than that of the full

information contract. Equivalently the marginal wage T(2.,n) > R, for
<

nb.

11

Another case of interest is where n also takes on two values, with

a indicating that s =

Sa

as before. However now suppose that n., indicates

that only m possible value values of s have positive probability, say
s1,s2,...,s

.

An argument similar to that given in Grossman—Hart [19821

or Azariadis [19821 can be used to show that 2.(s.,n.b) < £(s.). Further,
it will generally be the case that i(s.,n.D) < 9L.(si), except for the

largest s.. For example if m =

2

and the worker is only slightly risk

averse, then the employment inequality will be strict for the lower value
3/
of s.—

In the sections which follow we will assume that P(s,n) < 2(s)

when s is less than the largest possible realization of , and when n
imparts incomplete information about .

3. General Equilibrium With Physical Productivity Shocks

In the last section we reviewed our model of the optimal
employment contract when workers receive incomplete information about

their productivity. In this section we give the simplest possible
general equilibrium model for an economy which is subject to shocks.
We assume that workers know that the economy has received a shock, but

that they don't know how the shock affects their own firm. In this
model, aggregate unemployment will rise because an economy wide shock
increases the perceived variability of a worker's marginal physical
productivity.

We assume that firm i has a production function given by
q. =

(i.i)

s.f(.)

To illustrate our basic idea imagine that there is a steady state where

firms earn no rents. In this steady state all firms would have the same

profitability from employing labor. Hence s1 =

s2

=

...

.

Now imagine

that the economy is hit by a shock. This shock will hurt some firms more
than others. That is, it induces a non—degenerate distribution of
across firms .

We

assume that the owner of the firm knows how his s is

affected, but that the workers only know the cross sectional distribution.
Lacking any further knowledge the workers assume that their own firm's
productivity is a random drawing from that cross sectional distribution.
In the notation of the previous Section let

ii be the signal

observed by firms and workers about the economy wide shock. Let

—13—

F(sn)

be the cross sectional distribution of productivities associated

with the news

=

n.

It is convenient to have a notation for the news
*

that no shock has occurred. We denote the news by n = n

firms have s =

s

and let all

in that "steady state" situation:

Further,

is a discrete random variable, then

in s, assume that if

As an example of the above notation, consider the case where

there are two types of firms. Consider three possible pairs of productivities

for the firms: (s1,s2) =

(1/2, 1/2) or (1/3, 2/3) or (2/3, 1/3). In

the first situation s1 = s2
this

so there is no cross sectional dispersion;

*

corresponds to the news n— = n

.

In the second situation type 1 firms

are adversely affected relative to type 2 firms, while in the third
situation type 2 firms are adversely affected. We assume that the worker in each
firm knows the type of his firm but lacks the information to distinguish between
the second

and third situations. That is, workers receive a signal

Note that in both situation 2 and situation 3 workers observe the same

signal I =

It is not crucial to our analysis that the workers in

all firms know only that their firm's s.

is a random draw from the

cross sectional distribution F(s(n). Only notational complexity would

be added to what follows if we subscripted F with an i, as long as the
shocks which increase a given worker's uncertainty about his firm's -

productivity

It

also are associated with a greater cross sectional dispersion of '.

is useful to define the Wairasian (or complete information)

level of employment which would be associated with a particular cross

sectional distribution of the s.. Under complete information, when

workers have a utility of income I and labor

given by U(I—R2),

employment would be given by

(3.4)

R

This defines the employment level

*(s). If the worker in firm I

observes s.,, then he will write a contract with the firm agreeing to supply

wages w(s ) which shares risk by equating the firm's and worker's marginal

Further

if

we choose some measure of

for the cross sectional distribution of marginal products which

is continuous, then employment will be a monotonically decreasing function

of dispersion near the point of no dispersion. That is, suppose that

l' 2

(i1i2) and

for some value of n1 say n1 and

all values of n2. Thus n1 is news about the level of Walrasian
employment:. Suppose that n2 represents

information about the variance

of the Walrasian employment, i.e., a(n2) =

Var(*(,n1,n2)i1

monotone increasing in n2 and equal to zero at say n2

our previous statements imply that L°(n1,n2)

n.

Then

will be a monotone decreasing

—17—

function of cY(n2) say L(a(n2)), with L(O) L, in a neighborhood of
cl(n2) =

0.
It is important to note that the aggregate level of employment is

not a useful signal to the workers given that they already observe n.
The aggregate level of unemployment does not tell each worker how his
particular firm has been shocked, it only reveals something about the

dispersion of s across firms. Alternatively, workers who observe the
aggregate unemployment rate do not have complete information because knowledge
of how an aggregate variable is affected will not tell them how their own

firm is affected. Thus our model is fundamentally different from that of
Lucas [1972]. There it is assumed that people know their own situation

much better than economy wide values. We have assumed the reverse: shocks
are such that workers know more about the economy wide variable L(n), than
they know about their own firm's productivity. Thus Lucas' model would yield

no unemployment when the aggregate level of unemployment is observable hi1e
our model does yield unemployment in such cases.-

Relative Demand Shocks

In this Section we consider a model with many commodities where
relative demand shocks cause uncertainty about labor's marginal product

in a particular firm. An important shock hitting the economy are changes
in the price level (i.e., the price of goods in terms of money). Observed
changes in the price level which are not anticipated cause a redistribution

of wealth between nominal borrowers and nominal lenders. To the extent that
all borrowers and lenders do not have the same homothetic utility functions
for goods, the wealth redistribution will cause a change in relative prices.
To the extent that workers do not know how the observed change in the wealth
distribution affects their own firm this will cause an increase in uncertainty

about their marginal value product. We can apply an analysis similar to
that given in the previous Section to show that aggregate employment will
decrease more under optimal asymmetric information contracts, than it would
in a Walrasian model.

There are a number of difficulties in developing the above model.
One problem with modeling the effect of unanticipated price changes on
relative demands is that we should make an explicitly dynamic model of the

economy and put in some use for money. We expect to do that in future work,
but here will show, for a non monetary static economy, how a redistribution
of wealth will lead to larger changes in employment than would occur in a

Wairasian model. We will simply analyze the effect of changes in the
distribution of endowment wealth across consumers, in a multigood economy'

—19—

under asymmetric information.

Another problem is that it is difficult to model asymmetric information

about relative demand shocks in a competitive economy. If a firm operates in
a competitive product market then its demand is completely summarized by the

price of the product it sells relative to all other prices. If workers buy
the products sold by firms then they will observe the prices and cannot have
imperfect information about each firm's

demand.

To get around the above problem we assume that some firms produce

intermediate goods at prices which consumers do not observe. Further a worker
does not know how a change in the demand for a final consumption good affects

the demand for the particular intermediate good produced by his firm. As in
the last Section it is useful to assume that the only thing a worker knows

about the price his firm receives is that the price is a random drawing from
the current cross—sectional distribution of intermediate good prices which

other firms are receiving. We make the further assumption that the cross—
sectional distribution of intermediate good prices is the same as that of

final consumer goods. We now show that it is possible to construct a te.ic.ogy
of intermediate and final goods with the above properties.
Let there be two produced final (i.e. consumption) goods X and Y.

Let there be two intermediate goods 1(1 and K2. There are firms which use
labor and competitively produce good K1 ("type 1 firms"), and other firms

which competitively use labor to produce good K2 ("type 2 firms"). BorI
types of firms have the production function F(.)

of the previous Sectizi,

— 20—

Each final good is competitively assembled without the use of labor
according to the following linear production technology

(4.1)

X=(l—O)K1+0K2

(4.2)

Y=0K1+(l—@)K2

where 0 is the realization of a random variable 0. We assume that

(4.3)

0 < 0 < 1

and 0 is symmetric about 1/2

When 0 > 1/2, industry Y finds

more productive than K2, while

industry X finds that the reverse is true. The opposite is the case

when 0 < 1/2.

We will show that when 0 >

1/2 industry Y

will utilize only 1 and industry X will utilize only

when 0 > 1/2

Thus

an increase in the final demand for X will be good for

type 2 firms. When 0 <

1/2,

an increase in final demand for X will be

good for type 1 firms. Thus changes in final demand have benefits for

workers which depend on the realization of 0.

We assume that there is a third consumption good Z which is not
produced by current goods or current labor, but some consumers have an

endowment of it. We normalize the price of Z to be 1. For the rest

of this Section all prices are measured in terms of Z. Let v be
the price of intermediate good K. Let

and P be the prices

—21—

of X and Y respectively.
There are two cases to consider:
Case (1) 0 <

1/2.

In this case equilibrium involves industry X specializing in

the utilization of K1 and Y specializing in K2. This is because

(4.4)

Similarly if

that workers are indifferent about

Then workers and firms write a contract which makes the wage bill paid at

We assume that U is concave and that V is strictly concave. To simplify
matters, we assume that there are equal numbers of workers and firms.
Thus in equilbrium each firm makes a contract with exactly one worker at

date 0.

Other Consumers
There are other consumers who do not work or own intermediate goods'

firms. These consumers' only source of wealth is their endowment of the

non produced good e2. These consumers have Cobb Douglas utility functions

—26—

with a different parameter from firms or workers. Their parameters

are y1,y2,3. Their demands are

The only role of the "other consumers" is to generate changes in relative

prices due to changes in the wealth distribution. We could have considered
a wealth redistribution between firms

and

workers, but it is more difficult

to characterize the optimal labor contract when workers and firms

have

different tastes for consumer goods.

Equilibrium

Let e E (e1,e2). In equilibrium consumption prices n E (P,P) will
be a function of e. In turn, intermediate goods prices are functions of

n and 0 given in (4.9). Thus, given the distribution of n

the opposite is true. The firms know whether they are lucky

or not, i.e. whether 0 >

but the workers know only,

given n, that their firm's v is drawn from the distribution specified
in (4.10). The conditional distribution of

given n is analogous to

the conditional distribution F(sln) in Section 3. One difference is that

Conditions (4.l5)—(4.17), (4.19) and (4.21) characterize a contract
equilibrium under asyimnetric information. The way to think of this equilibrium

is as follows. There is an exogenously given probability distribution of the

-

-30—

=

endowment vector

P() =

(e1,e2).

In equilibrium there will be a price function

which says what prices correspond to a particular realization

of e. This in turn determines intermediate price functions v1(e,O),v2(e,O)
according to (4.9). Corresponding to this, there are optimal labor contracts
in the two industries which are solutions to (4.15)—(4.17). These contracts
in turn generate supplies of output, given in (4.2la) and (4.21b), for each
realization of ia

(P,P). Finally, for the system to be in equilibrium,

these supplies must clear markets, i.e. satisfy (4.19), for each n.±j

It is useful to acamine the Wairasian (or complete information

equilibrium) as a function of E E (EE). In a Walrasian Equilibrium wages
in each industry are equalized to the marginal product of labor. This

implies that the Walrasian equilibrium P,P,,

where (4.24) and (4.25) are equivalent to the condition that supply equals
demand in the two final goods industries (see the derivation of (4.19)).

We now use Proposition 1 to show that there is less employment in
the

asymmetric information equilibrium than in the Walrasian Equilibrium

when there is dispersion in goods prices. We have seen that, for a given

realization of n = (P,P), there will be a lucky intermediate
industry and an unlucky intermediate goods industry (if

and unlucky .if 0 < -

Hence appealing to the result in Section 2, we see that a firm that is in
the lucky industry will equate the marginal product of labor to the marginal

disutility of effort, while a firm that is in the unlucky industry will set the

marginal product of labor above the marginal disutility of effort. That is,

in an asymmetric information equilibrium, when say P > P, employment

QED

As in Section 3 we can show that the above Proposition implies
that increases in the dispersion of final good prices, which in the

Wairasian equilibrium would not affect total employment, will decrease
total employment under asymmetric information (note that if there is no

dispersion, i.e. P =

P

then

2..

=

and so employment under

asymmetric information equals employment under complete information which

equals Wairasian employment). In particular, the

—34—

Wairasian

equilibrium in (4.22)—(4.25) may be solved for prices and

employment as a function of the distribution of endowments e

(e1,e2)

using (4.20). Denote the solution by P(e1,e2), P(e1,e2),
Note that the distribution of

will not be the same. That is, changes in the wealth distribution can
be chosen which cause changes in relative demands such that (a) prices
change, (b) some industries contract while others expand and (c) the

Walrasjan total level of employment is the same. From Proposition 2 we
know that such changes will cause the level of total employment under
asymmetric information to fall.
An example of the above situation occurs when

If we start out with a distribution of wealth such that

A redistribution of wealth would lower

the asymmetric information level of employment if it kept the Wairasian
level the same because it would create greater uncertainty among workers about

—35—

their own firm's marginal value productivity of labor.'
We see that changes in the distribution of wealth will cause
relative price movements, which create uncertainty on the part of labor

about its marginal value product. We have taken the convention that
unequal final goods prices are associated with uncertainty about the

marginal value product of labor within each industry To see that this
is just a convention, consider a world of perfect certainty. Free entry
would lead resources to be allocated across industries in such a way

that prices are determined by minimum average costs. Since firms have
identical productions functions, minimum average cost would be the same.

If we instead began with industries that had different cost functions,
then the steady state — no shock situation would

to final good prices

which are unequal. However the profitability of labor would be equalized
across industries. A shock which changed relative demands would, in
the short run, create unequal profitability of hiring labor across

industries. We assume that workers only know the distribution of
profitabilities across industries and they think their firm's labor

profitability is a random drawing from that distribution. Hence a
shock which changes demand from its steady state value would cause
uncertainty about labor productivity within each industry, which would
cause a drop in employment relative to the Walrasian level.

We summarize the remarks following Proposition 2 with the
following
Statement:

Let the initial distribution of wealth have the property that

__) —

final

goods prices reveal to each worker the marginal value

product of labor in his firm. Then consider any change in
wealth across individuals which causes some industries to
expand and others contract, but keeps the total Walrasian
level of employment

constant. This change will cause

a decrease in total employment 2(e1,e2) when there is
-

asymmetric information.

5. Evidence and Conclusions
5a. Relative Price Variability As A Cause of Aggregate Output Variability

We have outlined a model of an economy subject to two kinds of

shocks: (a) an observable shock to the relative demand for final goods
which causes dispersion in relative prices, and (b) shocks, unobservable
by workers ,

to

the technology for transforming intermediate goods into

final goods. Workers in the intermediate goods industry cannot observe
the prices of the products they produce, but they can observe the cross

sectional distribution of prices. That is, they know whether conditions
are generally good or bad or dispersed, but not how their own particular

industry is affected. A worker in a particular intermediate goods industry
knows that the price of his output is determined by (1) a technological
shock that determines which final goods industry uses his output intensively

and (2) the price of the final good that uses his output intensively. When
there is very little relative price dispersion among final goods, then it

doesn't matter which final goods industry uses the worker's output. Thus
the technological shock is of very little importance in creating uncertainty

about the worker's marginal product when there is little dispersion of relative

prices. Hence an increase in the dispersion of relative prices amplifies
the effect of technological uncertainty on a worker's marginal value product.

We considered a model of optimal labor contracts in a situation whete
the workers have less information than the firm about their marginal value

product. A relative price shock of the type described above increases the

—38—

uncertainty

which workers have about their marginal value product. We

show that with an optimal asymmetric information employment contract the
industries which are adversely affected by the relative price shock will
contract more than they would under complete information (i.e., where
workers

could observe their marginal value product). On the other hand

the industry which is favorably affected by the relative price shock will
not

expand by more than would be the case under complete information.

Hence a relative demand shock, which would leave aggregate employment
unchanged under complete information, will cause aggregate employment to
fall under asymmetric information.

Before discussing potential sources for the relative price shocks,
it is worthwhile to present some evidence that is consistent with relative
price shocks having a causal role in the determination of aggregate output.
Since our Propositions only compare the full information effect of relative
demand shocks to the asymmetric information effect we have no direct
conclusion as to whether an increase in relative price variability raises

or lowers employment. However, if we assume that the shocks to relative
demands have no effect under complete information, then our Proposition
implies that aggregate employment will fall when relative demand
variability rises.

(To be more precise we showed that positive

variability induces lower employment than no variability, but by continuity
it follows that employment will fall when variability rises over a range
near zero variability.)

Fischer [1982] contains a survey of the literature on relative

—39—

price variability. He also studies the time series behavior of aggregate
output, relative price variability and other macroeconomic variables. In
a vector auto regression with relative price variability "put first,"
this variable can explain as much of the variability of output as interest
rate, money or inflation innovations (see his Table 8), i.e. about 10%

of the total variability of output. When relative price variability is
"put after" interest rates, money and inflation, it does as well as
inflation and money but worse than interest rates.

The relatively high explanatory power of relative price variability

for output is of course consistent with models other than ours. For
example all of Fischer's results are consistent with a Walrasian model
where at time t, people get information that future output will fall and
that the different components of output will fall in differing proportions.

With a conventional money demand model this will imply that prices will
rise in the future in differing proportions, and this in turn will raise

prices today in differing proportions. Thus the future decrease in output
will lead to an increase in expected inflation, and variability of inflation
and high nominal interest rates, which is exactly what Fischer finds.

Fischer also suggests three other models which are consistent with his
observations.

(b) The Causes of Relative Price Variability
The model presented in Section 4 assumes that a change in the

distribution of wealth is the source of a change in relative prices. There
are clearly many sources of relative price variability other than changes
in the distribution of wealth, e.g. variability in technology, tastes and

—40-

the prices of imports and exports. We have focused on wealth redistributions
as the source of relative price changes in order to provide the possibility

of a comparison with existing macroeconomic models. In particular assume
that the wealth redistribution occurs between nominal borrowers and lenders

when there is an unanticipated movement in the price level. Though we did
not present an intertemporal model with money and nominal prices, it would
not be difficult to append an additively separable utility of real balances

to preferences. Further we could model borrowing and lending associated

either with life cycle effects or random shocks to income)' In such a
model with nominal borrowing and lending unanticipated inflation will have
important effects on the distribution of wealth.

Approximately 50% of "wealth" is held in the form of nominally
denominated debt.-' Imagine that the economy is composed of two types of
individuals one of which is a nominal borrower and the other is a nominal

lender. Then a 10% permanent drop in the price level will increase the

real wealth of the lender by 50% of 10% = 5%.

The reverse will happen

to the nominal borrower. To the extent that the permanent drop of 10%
in the price level is associated with expected deflation, then there will

be a second effect in the wealth distribution in the same direction. Namely
the real price of long term nominal debt will rise due to the fall in the

nominal interest rate. People over 55 (the "old") tend to be nominal creditors

while people under 55 (the "young") tend to be nominal debtors. Fischer and
Nodigliani (1978) estimate (to within an order of magnitude) that a 1%

—41—

unanticipated increase in the price level will transfer wealth with a flow

value of about 1% of GNP.
Wealth redistributions will have no effect on relative prices if

wealth is redistributed between groups that have the same homothetic preferences.
However there is some evidence that there are systematic differences among

individuals in their preferences by age. Michael (1979), p.41 used the Bureau
of Labor Statistics' consumer expenditure survey to find that there are systematic
and significant differences among individuals' consumption proportions by age.

The classification of borrowers and lenders by age may not be the most useful for

tracing the consequences of the wealth redistribution. We mention it here
only because it is the only classification for which there is evidence that
the individuals are jointly sorted by desired consumption proportions and debt
positions.

There are some other obvious sources of wealth redistributions which
may be of sufficient magnitude to have caused observed output fluctuations.

For example unanticipated changes in nominal interest rates due either to
real or nominal factors will redistribute wealth between long term borrowers
and lenders, and this could be a source of relative price variability.

Alternatively, a large decrease in the real value of assets such as houses and
stocks can cause a large redistribution of wealth between the young and the

old. Exogenous changes in the productivity of capital could be the cause of
a change in the real value of assets.

(c)

Relative Demand Shifts vs Aggregate Demand Shifts
The previous discussion may obscure some of the difference between

—42—

our model and aggregate demand models of the cycle. To the extent that we
think that changes in aggregate demand can cause a wealth redistribution
which can cause employment fluctuations, there is some similarity between

our model and aggregate demand models. One important difference however
is that there is no presumption in our model that the sign of the aggregate

demand shock matters. A large unanticipated inflation can cause the same
increase in relative price dispersion as a large unanticipated deflation.-'
Hence there is no presumption that unanticipated inflation is expansionary

while unanticipated deflation is contractionary. To a first approximation
(i.e., where the Wairasian equilibrium total output is independent of the

wealth distribution), it would be the absolute value of the unanticiDated once
level change which would be negatively correlated with output in our model.
Further, if relative price variability is an independent variable explaining
output then unanticipated inflation should have little incremental explanatory
power.

Fischer (1982) and Blejer and Leiderman (1980) use innovations in
inflation and relative price variability as explanatory variables for output.
Their results are suggestive for each variable having some independent

explanatory power for output in the Post World War II United States.'
Fischer (1982) Figure 3, and Sims (1980) Table 3, both find that in
the Post World War II period positive price innovations precede a fall in

output. Our conclusion from this is that in the Post World War II period,
though the data are suggestive of an independent effect of price innovations,
the sign is the reverse of what would have been predicted by the models of
Sargent or Lucas, or Barro, (see Barro (1981) for a survey of models where
unanticipated inflation causes an increase in output).

—43—

The period before World War II is likely to be favorable to the

unanticipated inflation model. Sims (1980), Table 3, finds that negative
price innovations precede falls in output in the period between World War I

and World War II.) Unfortunately, we have not been able to find any evidence
which has attempted to distingusih the relative price variability hypothesis

from the unanticipated inflation hypothesis in that period. In the pre World
War II period, large unanticipated deflation may well be a proxy for high

variability of relative prices. This is consistent with Parks' (1978)
finding in his Tables 2 and 6.

Thus it seems that further empirical research needs to be undertaken
to distinguish the hypothesis that unanticipated falls in money (or prices)

decrease output, from the hypothesis that monetary or price level shocks of

any sign decrease output. In addition further theoretical research needs to
be undertaken to develop models where the sign of the publically observed
shock, as well as its size, affects output.

then (*(s),nb) can be set equal to

without lower utility for the worker.

The above result was proved by us for the situation where there was a

discrete number of possible values for i. The continuous £ cases can
be achieved by taking a limit of our previous result. Taking the limit

does not lead to equality between 2(s,nb) and i*(s), for the reason
given above: The worker bears no risk, and the efficiency loss from

lowering 9(s,n,0) just below 9*(s) will always be smaller than the
benefits from increased risk sharing (since at a productive optimum small

changes in 2 have only a second order effect on sf(2.)—R).

The inequality in eq. (3.7) depends on the assumption that the firm's

manager is risk averse. If managers hold well diversified portfolio's,
then a shock which increases the cross sectional dispersion of profitability

will have no impact on the manager's wealth. Hence he will be risk neutral
with respect to such shocks. However suppose that the manager is an agent
for the owners of the firm. Then the owners will tie the manager's
remuneration to the performance of his own company. An optimal incentive
scheme between the owner and the manager will not permit the manager to
diversify away the risk associated with his firm's performance since this

will dilute the manager's incentive to maximize profit. See Hart (1982) for
an implicit contract model between a firm and its workers in the presence
of a moral hazard problem between managers and owners.

2/ In more general versions of Lucas' model the aggregate unemployment rate

may not be a suffficient statistic for the economy wide shock. However it

is essential to his model that the economy wide shock itself (eg the
money supply) is not directly observable.

Footnotes for Section 4

1/ If there are no futures markets, and labor at time t is used to
produce goods at time t+l, then it might appear that workers and
firms could have different information about the value of employing

labor at t. However, if the workers wage at date t+l can be made
conditional on the date t+l spot prices that the firm learns at
t, then it can be shown that employment under an optimal

contract will be at the same level as if both the worker and firm

observed the date t+l spot price at date t.
2/

W0 want to model the idea that workers know general labor market

conditions better than conditions in their own firm. Thus workers
observe the cross sectional mean and variance of employment from newspaper

reports on the economy wide and regional unemployment rates. They do

not know the state of demand for their own firm's product. Further if
there are many firms in a given industry, then the employment level of
other identical firms will provide a useful signal to workers in a given

firm. We assume that no such signal is available. To the extent that
firms in the same industry are not completely identical but are subject
to idiosyncratic shocks to demand, then the employment level of other
firms in the same industry may be a poor signal about a given firm's

demand.

contract is unique.

4/ We must also add the condition that U(O) < 13

< U

*
,

where

U

*

is that

level of utility at which firms are indifferent between signing a contract

with a worker and not operating at all. It is clear that from this that

there will in general be different equilibria according to where U lies
in this range. This indeterminacy results from our assumption that there
is an inelastic, integral supply of workers at date 0 and would disappear

if we had a smooth upward sloping supply curve of date 0 workers. It
should also be pointed out that, while in the model of this paper
equilibrium prices and employment will in general depend on the value of

U, this is not the case if 13

and V exhibit constant absolute risk

aversion. In this case the employment function Z(v,n) which solves
(4.15)—(4.17) is independent of U (see Grossman and Hart [1982]).
5/ It can be shown that, under the usual assumptions, contract equilibrium
under asymmetric information exists.

6/ Note that if a monetary contraction causes the change in the distribution
of wealth, then prices of goods relative to the non produced good (money)

will fall rather than rise. An implication of our result is that the
decrease in supply which is associated with the increased uncertainty

will cause prices in terms of money to fall by less than they would
under complete information.

7/ Note that, in general, a simple transfer of wealth, i.e., where
=
—Ae2

will not keep the Wairasian level of employment constant.

In our simple example with two

types

of produced goods, there is a

one dimensional locus of points (e1,e2) where 9(e1,e2) =

9-.

There is no reason for that locus to coincide with the set of

(e1,e2) such that e1+e2

constant. In the case with m- produced

cotnmoditjes and at least 3 consumer types, the Walrasian total
employment

2-. will depend on all the E.,, 2.(E1,E,...,E).

There

will then be an rn—i dimensional locus of (Ei•••Ern) points where

is

constant. So it is easy to merely redistribute income across

consumer types to keep Wairasian employment constant.
