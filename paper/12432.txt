On the Determinants of Exporters’ Currency Pricing: History vs. Expectations

JEL No. F12, F31, F33
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this paper is to investigate why the choice of invoice currency under exchange rate
uncertainty depends not only on expectations but also on history. The analysis is motivated by the
fact that the U.S. dollar has historically been the dominant vehicle currency in developing countries.
The theoretical analysis is based on an open economy model of monopolistic competition. When
the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set their prices not to deviate from
those of the competitors. As a result, a coordination failure can lead the third currency to be a less
efficient equilibrium invoice currency. The role of expectations is important in selecting the
equilibrium in the static framework. However, in the dynamic model with staggered price-setting,
the role of history becomes another key determinant of the equilibrium currency pricing. The role
of history may dominate the role of expectations when the firms are myopic, particularly in the
competitive local market. It also becomes dominant in the staggered price setting when a small
fraction of the new price setters are backward-looking. The result suggests the importance of history
in explaining why the firm tends to choose the US dollar as vehicle currency.

1. Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the choice of invoice currency in developing
countries. In previous literature, several theoretical studies investigated the choice of invoice
currency in international trade. Baron (1976) and Giovannini (1988) are their early attempts.
The authors such as Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2005), Devereux and Engel (2001), and
Devereux, Engel, and Storegaard (2004) use a general equilibrium setup. Recent studies that
investigate pricing behavior of international trade with developing countries include Frankel, Parsley
and Wei (2005). Most of previous studies analyzed the case where the exporting firm sets prices

either in the exporters’ currency (producer’s currency pricing, PCP) or in the importers’ currency
(local currency pricing, LCP). It is, however, well known that some of international trades are
invoiced in a third currency, that is, vehicle currency (vehicle currency pricing, VCP). Over most
of the past hundred years, first the pound sterling and then the U.S. dollar have played a special
role as vehicle currency in international trade.1
Except for primary commodities, the role of vehicle currency is relatively limited in
international trade among developed countries (see McKinnon [1979] and Magee and Rao
[1980]).2 The U.S. dollar, however, has historically been the dominant vehicle currency in
international trade with developing countries. Many developing countries have chosen the U.S.
dollar as the vehicle currency even when they have the other developed countries as important
trade partners. The choice of invoice currency is particularly important in developing countries
where efficient forward markets as well as other foreign exchange derivatives are missing to
hedge the exchange rate risk.
The following theoretical analysis is based on an open economy model of monopolistic competition.
Since the export prices are set in advance, the exporting firms face uncertainty of exchange rates. If
necessary, the exporting firm set prices in its own currency or in the currency of the importing country.
However, when the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set prices not to deviate
from those of the competitors. As a result, when the other exporters are expected to set their prices in
the third currency, the exporting firms tends to invoice in the third currency. The tendency becomes
conspicuous in the staggered price-setting framework where history becomes a key determinant of the
invoice currency.

Historians estimate that 60% to 90% of the world’s trade was invoiced in the pound sterling in the
19th century. See, for example, Broz (1997). The pound sterling retained its dominant position as key
currency in the interwar period, although the UK passed from net creditor to net debtor after World
War I.

There are numerous empirical studies that explore the choice of invoice currency. Some of recent
studies include Donnenfeld and Haug (2003) for Canadian experience, Fukuda and Ono (2005) for

Our model follows a partial equilibrium model in Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2002). It, however,
has three distinctive features that the previous study did not have. First, we allow the exporting firms
to choose the third currency as an invoice currency. In developing countries, the exporting firms are
under competition because of less differentiated products. It is thus a natural choice for the exporting
firm to set prices in the third currency when the competitors are expected to set their prices in the third
currency. The result explains the role of the US dollar as vehicle currency that prevails in many
developing countries. Second, we consider a dynamic Nash equilibrium where players move
sequentially. The model is in the tradition of Taylor (1980, 2000), in that price-setting is staggered.3
Firms that adjust their price in a given period set their price to maximize the present discounted value
of profits over the periods that the price will be charged. Even in the dynamic Nash equilibrium, the
expectations determine the equilibrium currency pricing when the discount rate is negligible.
However, history becomes the key determinant of the equilibrium currency pricing when future profits
are discounted, particularly in the competitive local market. Third, we show that a coordination
failure can lead the third currency to be an equilibrium invoice currency. Since multiple equilibria are
Pareto ranked, it implies that the equilibrium choice of the invoice currency may lead to a less
efficient equilibrium. The risk averse exporters are always better off under the exporters’ currency
pricing than under any other currency pricing. It would be more efficient for the exporters to change
their invoice currency from the vehicle currency to their own currency. To improve the welfare,
changing their expectations is an important factor. However, when history does matter, it is difficult
to change the expectations without reducing the discount rate or increasing their competitiveness.
In previous literature, some studies explored the role of vehicle currency in international trade.
Krugman (1980) and Rey (2001) show that transaction costs might make vehicle currency a dominant
medium of exchange in international trade. These studies are, however, successful only in explaining
the role of vehicle currency as a medium of exchange, through which transactions between currencies
are made. In contrast, our approach tries to explain the role of vehicle currency as a unit account in
terms of which prices of commodities are set. A unit account is another important function of vehicle
currency. Friberg (1998) and Goldberg and Tille (2005) are two exceptional studies that investigated
the role of vehicle currency as a unit account. Assuming that the exporter commits to sell the
demanded quantity at the ex post realized price, they explored under what conditions the
monopolistically competitive exporter chooses the third currency as vehicle currency. None of these
studies, however, explored the case where a coordination failure can lead to less efficient equilibrium
under vehicle currency pricing. More importantly, these studies are static analysis that could not
analyze the case where “history” does matter. It is well known that the U.S. dollar has historically
Korean experience, Fukuda and Ji (1994), Oi, Otani, and Shirota (2004) for Japanese experience, and
Wilander (2004) for Swedish experience.

been the dominant vehicle currency in most of developing countries. The following model will show
that “history” is a key determinant for the exporters’ pricing behavior in developing countries.
The paper proceeds as follows. After providing some empirical evidence on the invoice currency in
section 2, section 3 describes our basic model structure. Section 4 drives its Nash equilibria in the
static framework. Section 5 explores the dynamic model with the staggered price setting and shows
that history does matter on the choice of invoice currency. Section 6 extends the model to the case
where some of the new price setters change the expectations as leaders. Section 7 summarizes our
results and refers to their implications.

2. Some Empirical Evidence
During the past decades, the U.S. dollar has been the dominant vehicle currency in
international trade with developing countries. The Bank of Thailand reports various data sets that
support this view. Table 1 shows in which currencies Thai exports have been invoiced since
1993. It states that nearly 90% of Thai exports have been invoiced in the US dollar and that only
10% have been invoiced in the Japanese yen. The percentages are almost stable throughout the
period, although the ratios of the U.S. dollar show marginal declines after 1998.
The view is more strongly supported by Table 2 that reports the invoiced ratios of Thai exports
classified by major trade partners. The table indicates that the U.S. dollar tends to be the
dominant vehicle currency in Thai exports to various countries. When the United States, Canada,
or Mexico are trade partners, almost all of the exports are invoiced in the US dollar. Even when
Japan, Europe, or the other East Asian countries are trade partners, majority of the exports are
invoiced in the US dollar. For example, in the exports to Japan, more than 70% are invoiced in
the US dollar and only 20% are invoiced in the Japanese yen. The invoiced ratio in the U.S.
dollar is relatively modest in the exports to Germany. However, most of exports are invoiced in
the US dollar in the exports to the other European countries, particularly to Denmark, France,
Ireland, United Kingdom, and Finland. The dominance of the US dollar also prevails in the
exports to other East Asian countries.4 In particular, in the exports to Singapore, Malaysia, and
Vietnam, more than 90% are invoiced in the US dollar. Except for the exports to the United
States, the US dollar is a third currency in the Thai exports. This implies that the U.S. dollar
tends to be chosen as the dominant vehicle currency in invoicing most of Thai exports.

4

Exceptions are the exports to Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. In the exports, Thai Baht is equally
important invoice currency. This is probably because the Thai economy has a strong influence to
these countries.
4

The result is essentially the same for the invoiced currency ratios in Korean exports. Table 3
reports in which currencies Korean exports have been invoiced since 1976. It shows that the
invoiced ratios of the US dollar were over 90% in visible exports and over 80% in invisible
exports. The dominant ratios of the US dollar declined during a past decade years. However, even in
recent years, the ratios of the US dollar still lied between 85% and 90% in Korean visible exports and
around 75% in Korean invisible trades.
Table 4 summarizes the amount shares of various export destinations from Korea and Thailand.
We can see that Japan and Western Europe as well as other Asian countries have been the other
important trade partners for Thai and Korean exports. The evidence indicates that the U.S. dollar was
chosen as the dominant vehicle currency even in the case where the United States is not a dominant
trade partner. It is noteworthy that Japan has been the second biggest partner for both Thai exports

and Korean exports. This implies that Thai and Korean exporters choose the U.S. dollar as the
vehicle currency even in the exports to one of the most important trade partners.
One may argue that these countries choose the U.S. dollar as the dominant invoice currency
because their exchange rates are stable against the U.S. dollar. The argument may have been
relevant before the Asian crisis when they effectively pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar
(see, for example, Frankel and Wei [1994]). However, after the crisis, these countries shifted the
exchange rate regime from de facto dollar peg to float. As a result, there is no longer a natural
reason for them to choose the U.S. dollar as the dominant invoice currency to stabilize their
export prices in terms of domestic currencies.
One may also argue that the U.S. dollar is the dominant invoice currency because trading
companies are in charge of both exports and imports at the same time. When the amount of
exports is equal to the amount of imports, the exchange rate risk can be perfectly diversified.
Therefore, if trading companies invoice both exports and imports in the US dollar, they would
make a partial diversification of exchange rate risk. Table 5 reports components of Thai export
receipts in 2001 and 2002. It shows that about 30% of export receipts are deposited to foreign
currencies in both years. The percentages indicate that Thai exporters may keep some of their
foreign exchange receipts for reducing exchange risk in future import payments. The table,
however, also reports that about 65% of export receipts are exchanged from foreign currencies to
Thai Baht directly. This implies that more than two thirds of export receipts are still exposed to
exchange risk in Thailand.

3. A Model of Export Pricing Behavior under Exchange Rate Uncertainty

5

The purpose of the following sections is to present our theoretical framework that discusses pricing
behavior under exchange rate uncertainty. The pricing behavior we study in the following analysis is
that of exporters who produce only in their home country. For simplicity, we assume that all
exporting firms sell all of their products in a single foreign market. There are three countries: an
exporting country, an importing country, and a third country. The third country has no international
trade with the other two countries.5
Each exporter sets its export price before the exchange rates are known. In setting the export price,
it has the choice among its own currency pricing (i.e., producer’s currency pricing, PCP), the
importers’ currency pricing (i.e., local currency pricing, LCP), and the third currency pricing (i.e.,
vehicle currency pricing, VCP). The exchange rates s0, s, and s/s0 are exogenous and are assumed to
be the only source of uncertainty. Selling s0 units of the third currency leads to one unit of the
importers’ currency on the spot market and selling s units of the exporters’ currency leads to one unit
of the importers’ currency on the spot market. By definition, the exchange rate between the exporters’
currency and the third currency is given by the relation s/s0. For simplicity, we assume that each
exchange rate is independently identically distributed with constant mean over time. We also assume
that s is uncorrelated with s0, so that E (s - E s)(s0 - E s0) = 0.
In the following analysis, each exporter is under monopolistic competition and firm j faces the
demand function D(pj, P*), where pj is the price set by the firm j measured in the importers’ currency.
P* is the aggregate price index in the importers’ local market denominated in the importers’ currency.
The aggregate price index P* depends on the exchange rate unless all exporting firms set their prices
in the importers’ currency. We assume that the total number of firms is large enough so that an
individual firm does not affect the price index P*.
The objective of each exporter is to maximize the expected profits in terms of his (or her) home
currency. The central assumptions are that the exporter has to set price before the exchange rates are
known and that demand is a function of the price that importers face after exchange rate uncertainty is
resolved. Suppose that each exporter chooses pE under the exporters’ currency pricing, pI under the
importers’ currency pricing, and p0 under the third currency pricing. By definition, the unit price of
imports in terms of the importers’ currency is pE/s when invoiced in the exporters’ currency, pI when
invoiced in the importers’ currency, and p0/s0 when invoiced in the third currency. Let ΠE, ΠI, and Π0
denote the exporter’s profit under the exporters’ currency pricing, under the importers’ currency
pricing, and under the third currency pricing respectively. The profit from each currency pricing is
then respectively given by
5

It would be more natural to suppose that the third country also trades with the two countries. It may
make the third currency pricing more likely outcome. The main objective of the following analysis is,
however, to show that the third currency might be chosen as an equilibrium invoice currency under a
less favorable environment for the third currency pricing.
6

(1) ΠE = pE D(pE/s, P*) – C[D(pE/s, P*)],
(2) ΠI = s pI D(pI, P*) – C[D(pI, P*)],
(3) Π0 = (s/s0) p0 D(p0/s0, P*) – C[D(p0/s0, P*)],
where C[·] is cost function that is strictly increasing and strictly convex. The costs are assumed to be
incurred in terms of the exporters’ currency.
In the following analysis, we assume that the firms are risk averse and maximize the expected utility
from the profits. The utility function of each firm is U (Π), which is strictly increasing and strictly
concave in Π.

4. The Static Analysis
(i) The model structure
We first consider the static case where the price is fixed only for a period. In equilibrium, each
exporter chooses the exporters’ currency pricing if EU(ΠE) ≥ EU (ΠI) and EU (ΠE) ≥ EU (Πo), the
importers’ currency pricing if EU (ΠI )≥ EU (ΠE) and EU (ΠI) ≥ EU (Π o), and the third currency
pricing if EU (Π0) ≥ EU (ΠI )and EU (Πo) ≥ EU (Π E). For analytical simplicity, we assume the
following set of constant elasticity demand and cost functions:
(4)

D(pj, P*) = A (pj/P*)-µ,

(5)

C(D) = B Dη,

where µ > 1 and η > 1. If the consumers in the importing country have CES preferences with
elasticity µ > 1 among the different products, we can specify the demand for goods from firm j as (4).
Larger µ implies higher (smaller) degree of substitutability among the products. The aggregate price
index in the importers’ local market P* is given by

1
(6) P* =
N

N
i =1

pi

1− µ

1 /(1− µ )

where N is the number of firms in the importers’ local market and pi is a price set by exporting firm i
in the importers’ currency.

7

Under (4) and (5), the representative exporter’s expected utility for each currency denomination is
respectively written as
(7) E U(ΠE) = E U {A pE [(pE/s) / P*)]-µ – AηB [(pE/s) / P*)]-µη},
(8) E U(ΠI ) = E U {A s pI (pI /P*)-µ – AηB (pI /P*)-µη},
(9) E U(Π0 ) = E U {A (s/s0) p0 [(p0/s0) / P*)]-µ – AηB [(p0/s0) / P*)]-µη}.
Since the choice of currency pricing is irrelevant under certainty, it holds that ΠE = ΠI = Π0 ≡ Π* near
s0 = E s0 and s = E s. We can also show that pE = pI E s = p0 (E s /E s0) = Aη-1B µη/(µ-1). It is easy to
see that the optimal price is a constant markup µ/(µ-1) over the marginal cost B.
By using the envelop theorem, a second order Taylor expansion near s0 = E s0 and s = E s leads to
(10) E U (Πj) ≈ U(Π*) + (1/2) U′(Π*) (Π11j σ02 + Π22j σ2), for j = E, I, and 0,
where Π11j ≡ d2Πj/d s02 and Π22j ≡ d2Πj/d s2 at s0 = E s0 and s = E s. After some tedious calculations
shown in Appendix, we therefore obtain that near s0 = E s0 and s = E s,
(11) [E U(Π0) - E U (ΠI)]/ U′(Π*) = (1/2) [∂2Π0/∂ s02 + 2 (∂2Π0/∂ P*∂ s0)(∂P*/∂ s0)] σ02,
= - {(1/2) (1/s0) 2 [µ(η-1) + 1] + (1/p0)(η-1)µ (∂P*/∂ s0)} pE A (µ-1)σ02,
(12) [E U(Π0)- E U (ΠE) ]/ U′(Π*) = (1/2) {[∂2Π0/∂ s02 + 2 (∂2Π0/∂ P*∂ s0)(∂P*/∂ s0)] σ02
- (1/2){∂2ΠE/∂ s2 + 2[(∂2ΠE/∂ P*∂ s) - (∂2ΠI/∂ P*∂ s)](∂P*/∂ s)} σ2,
= - {(1/2) (1/s0) 2 [µ(η-1) + 1] + (1/p0)(η-1)µ (∂P*/∂ s0)} pE A (µ-1)σ02
+ {(1/2) (1/s) 2 pE [µ(η-1) - 1] + (η-1)µ (∂P*/∂ s)} A (µ-1) σ2,
(13) [E U (ΠI) - E U(ΠE)]/ U′(Π*)
= - (1/2){∂2ΠE/∂ s2 + 2[(∂2ΠE/∂ P*∂ s) - (∂2ΠI/∂ P*∂ s)](∂P*/∂ s)}σ2,
= {(1/2) (1/s) 2 pE [µ(η-1) - 1] + (η-1)µ (∂P*/∂ s)} A (µ-1) σ2.
where we denote the variances as σ2 ≡ E (s - E s)2 and σ02 ≡ E (s0 - E s0)2 respectively.
(ii) Nash equilibrium
Based on (11)-(13), we investigate which currency the exporters denominate their product in a Nash
equilibrium. Focusing on a symmetric equilibrium, we can show that both the importers’ currency
pricing and the third currency pricing are a Nash equilibrium if equation (11) is positive, that is, if

8

(14) µ(η-1) > 1.
Both the importers’ currency pricing and the third currency pricing are a Nash equilibrium under the
same condition because there is a herding effect where the exporting firms keep their prices not to
deviate from those of the competitors under the competitive market. When the importers’ currency
pricing is a Nash equilibrium, the aggregate price P* = pI is independent of exchange rates, so that
equation (11) is always negative. Therefore, the importers’ currency pricing is a Nash equilibrium
only if equation (13) is positive, that is, µ(η-1) > 1. When the third currency pricing is a Nash
equilibrium, it holds that P* = p0/s0. Since ∂ P*/∂ s0 = - p0/s02 when P* = p0/s0, equation (12) is
always positive if equation (11) is positive. Therefore, the third currency pricing is a Nash
equilibrium only if equation (11) is positive, that is, µ(η-1) > 1.
In contrast, the exporters’ currency pricing is a Nash equilibrium under more general environments.
When the exporters’ currency pricing is a Nash equilibrium, it holds that P* = pE/s. Since ∂ P*/∂ s =
- pE/s2 when P* = pE/s, both equations (12) and (13) are negative if
(15) µ(η-1) + 1 ≥ 0,
The exporters’ currency pricing is therefore a Nash equilibrium if (15) holds. The exporters’ currency
pricing is the only Nash equilibrium if µ(η-1) < 1. The denomination in the exporters’ currency tends
to be the only Nash equilibrium when the local market is less competitive. However, it is noteworthy
that the model has multiple Nash equilibria where any currency pricing is an equilibrium if (14) holds.
Under the multiple Nash equilibria, the choice of the currency denomination becomes arbitrary
depending on the exporters’ expectations on which currency the other exporters will choose (that is,
sunspots do matter).
In our model, the multiple Nash equilibria occur when µ is large, that is, when the market is
competitive. In the competitive market, the exporter looses its market shares when its price exceeds
the competitors’. It is therefore important for the exporting firms to choose the same currency pricing
as that of the competitors. This indicates that the exporters’ expectations lead to arbitrary price setting,
especially when the exporters face a competitive local market.
It is worthwhile to note that multiple equilibria are Pareto ranked. This implies that the equilibrium
choice of invoice currency may be a less efficient equilibrium. The expected utility of each exporter
in the Nash equilibrium is respectively written as
(16a) EU(ΠI) = E U (A s pI – AηB) under the importers’ currency pricing,
(16b) EU(Π0) = E U [A (s/s0) p0 – AηB] under the third currency pricing,

9

(16c) EU(ΠE) = E U (A pE – AηB) under the exporters’ currency pricing.
Since U(ΠE) = U(ΠI ) = U(Π0) ≡ U(Π*) near s0 = E s0 and s = E s, equations (16a) – (16c) imply
that the risk averse exporters are always better off under the exporters’ currency pricing than under
any other currency pricing. In addition, the exporters’ utility is higher (lower) under the importers’
currency pricing than the third currency pricing when the variance of s is smaller (larger) than the
variance of s/s0. In our model, a coordination failure may make the equilibrium choice of invoice
currency less efficient.6

5. The Dynamic Analysis
(i) The model framework
In the last section, we explored the choice of currency pricing in the static framework. The
framework is useful when considering under what circumstances expectations determine the choice of
invoice currency in competitive local markets. However, since the expectations are not pathdependent, the static framework cannot explain why history is another key factor in determining
equilibrium currency pricing. It is widely observed that the US dollar has historically been the
dominant invoice currency in many developing countries. We need a theory that explains why history
does matter in determining equilibrium currency pricing.
In this section, we consider a dynamic Nash equilibrium where players move sequentially. As in
the previous section, each exporter sets price before the exchange rates are known and the demand is a
function of the price that importers face after exchange rate uncertainty is resolved. However, the
price contract is long-term so that the exporters cannot change the prices for period H. The model is
in the tradition of Taylor (1980, 2000), in that price-setting is staggered: each firm sets its price for H
periods.7 In each period, a fraction 1/H of firms can choose their new price but a fraction 1-1/H of
firms cannot. Firms that adjust their price in a given period set their price to maximize the present
discounted value of profits over the H periods that the price will be charged.
Define the present discounted value of profits as Vt E ≡
currency pricing, as Vt I ≡

t −1 EU (Π E ) under the exporters’
H
t
t =1 β

H β t −1 EU (Π I ) under the importers’ currency pricing, and as V 0
t
t
t =1

Under symmetric Nash equilibrium, all export prices are equalized, so that D(pj, P*) = A (pj/P*)-µ =
A. The welfare of consumers in the importing countries therefore does not depend on the choice of
invoice currency.
7
It has been more common in recent work with sticky-price models to use the Calvo framework, in
which firms face an exogenous, constant probability of being able to adjust their price. The following
results essentially hold even in the Calvo framework.
6

10

≡ tH=1 β t −1EU (Π t0 ) under the third currency pricing respectively, where β is a discount factor.
Then, in equilibrium, each exporter chooses the exporters’ currency pricing if Vt E ≥ Vt I and Vt E ≥ Vt 0,
the importers’ currency pricing if Vt I ≥ Vt E and Vt I ≥ Vt 0, and the third currency pricing if Vt 0 ≥ Vt I
and Vt 0 ≥ Vt E. Unlike the static model, the dynamic model requires the comparison of the present
discounted value of profits over H periods.
If all exporters set the prices simultaneously, the dynamic analysis degenerates into the static case
discussed in the last section. In this case, to the extent that the condition (14) holds, only expectations
matter in determining equilibrium currency pricing even in the dynamic framework. However, if
there is heterogeneity in the price settings, the currency the exporters initially chose could continue to
be the equilibrium denomination currency as inertia. The staggered price setting is a useful
assumption that incorporates heterogeneity in the price settings in the dynamic framework.
When the equilibrium currency pricing is history dependent and is chosen as inertia, the role of
expectations disappears in the dynamic Nash equilibrium because changed expectations are not selffulfilling. To see this, suppose that all of the exporters had historically fixed their prices in the third
currency until period 0. Suppose also that at period 1, the new price setting exporters formed new
expectations that all of the new price setters would fix their prices in the exporters’ currency after
period 1. If the new expectations are self-fulfilling, switching from the third currency pricing to the
extorters’ currency pricing at period 1 would be a Nash equilibrium. Otherwise, the third currency
pricing would remain the Nash equilibrium even after period 1.
When the expectations are self-fulfilling, it is likely to hold that EU (Πt E) < EU (Πt o) for t < T and
that EU (Πt E) > EU (Πt o) for t ≥ T, where 1 < T < H. This is because the third currency pricing is still
dominant among the exporters when t is small but the exporters’ currency pricing becomes dominant
when t is large. To fulfill the expectations that all of the new price setters would fix their prices in the
exporters’ currency after period 1, it is thus necessary that

(17)

t −1 EU (Π E ) − EU (Π 0 ) ≥
H
t
t
t =T β

T −1 β t −1 EU (Π 0 ) − EU (Π E ) .
t
t
t =1

The above condition is a necessary condition for the exporters’ currency pricing to be a new Nash
equilibrium. If the condition (17) does not hold, the third currency would remain the equilibrium
denomination currency as inertia.8

8

Strictly speaking, for the third currency to remain the equilibrium currency, we also need that
switching from the third currency pricing to the importers’ currency pricing at period 1 would not be a
Nash equilibrium.
11

(ii) Calibration
To understand what makes the condition (17) less likely to hold and under what conditions the third
currency remains to be the Nash equilibrium, we specify the utility function and calculate the expected
utility of the profit under three alternative currency pricings. We specified the utility function of the
exporters as U (Π ) ≡

Π /2 and calculated the utilities of the exporters for 10,000 random samples

of exchange rates, assuming that the changes of the exchange rates follow standard normal distribution
with zero mean.9 In the calibration, we choose the parameter set such that η = 3, A = 1, and B = 10.
We also set that H = 48. In our model, a fraction of 1/H of all exporters set prices each period for H
periods. The period H always corresponds to the period for the prices are sticky (e.g., one year), so
that the large value of H implies the large degree of staggering. Altering the interpretation of the time
unit, we can vary H to examine its role in affecting equilibrium currency pricing. For example, if the
time unit is weekly or semi-weekly, we can set the value of H reasonably large. What is important in
the following calibration is that the value of H needs to be large enough for the price setters to be very
heterogeneous.
Figures 1-a, 1-b, and 1-c draw the calibrated values of EU (Πt E), EU (Πt o), and EU (Πt I) from t = 1
to t = H for three alternative values of µ: µ = 5, 7.5, and 10. The calibrated values are based on the
assumption that all of the exporters had fixed their prices in the third currency until period 0 but that
all of the new price setters would fix their prices in the exporters’ currency after period 1. Regardless
of the choice of µ, EU (Πt o) exceeds both EU (Πt E) and EU (Πt I) when t < 24, while EU (Πt E)
exceeds both EU (Πt o) and EU (Πt I) when t ≥ 24. This reflects the fact that the third currency pricing
is still dominant among the exporters when t is small but the exporters’ currency pricing becomes
dominant when t is large. Analytically, the overall price index at period t (t = 1, 2, …, H) is

.

Even after period 1, a fraction 1 - t/H of firms still keep denominating the price in the third currency at
period t (t = 1, 2, …, H) in the staggered price setting. The weight of firms that keep denominating
the price in the third currency is large when t is small but declines over time. The weight of firms that
denominates the price in the exporters’ currency becomes large when t is large. The calibrated
utilities in the figures reflect these environments.
When the discount factor β is small (that is, when the exporters are myopic and discount the future
profits enough), the losses from changing expectations always dominate the benefits in the future. It

12

is therefore costly to change the denomination currency, so that the exporters’ currency pricing will
not be a new Nash equilibrium. For example, when β = 0.98, Vt 0 = 298.69, Vt E = 298.32, and VtI =
298.52 when µ = 10; Vt 0 = 307.34, Vt E = 307.18, and VtI = 307.27 when µ = 7.5; Vt 0 = 325.27, Vt E =
325.23, and VtI = 325.25 when µ = 5. The condition (17) does not hold for any of the three alternative
values of µ. Since the exporters have no incentive to change its denomination currency from the third
currency to the exporters’ currency, they continue the third currency pricing as inertia when the future
profits are discounted enough.
In contrast, when β is very close to one, the changed expectations can lead the exporters’ currency
pricing to be a new Nash equilibrium. When β = 1, Vt 0 = 461.36, Vt E = 461.79, and VtI = 461.60 when
µ = 10; Vt 0 = 474.98, Vt E = 475.27, and VtI = 475.13 when µ = 7.5; Vt 0 = 502.85, Vt E = 503.02, and
VtI = 502.94 when µ = 5. In our parameter set, Vt E always exceeds both Vt 0 and VtI under the changed
expectations for any of the three alternative values of µ. The exporters have an incentive to change its
denomination currency from the third currency to the exporters’ currency when the exporters do not
discount the future profits. Only expectations play the essential role in changing the equilibrium
currency pricing. To the extent that all of the new price setters are expected to fix their prices in the
exporters’ currency after period 1, the exporters’ currency pricing always becomes a new Nash
equilibrium after period 1 when β = 1. It is, however, worthwhile to note that the exporters need to
change the expectations after period 1 for the exporters’ currency pricing to be an equilibrium. If
none of the new price setters changed the expectations at period 1, the third currency pricing would
remain a Nash equilibrium after period 1 even when β = 1.
In our parameter set, some intermediate cases arise when β is around 0.99. When β = 0.99, Vt 0 =
368.06, Vt E = 368.00, and VtI = 368.05 when µ = 10; Vt 0 = 378.82, Vt E = 378.84, and VtI = 378.84
when µ = 7.5; Vt 0 = 400.98, Vt E = 401.02, and VtI = 401.01 when µ = 5. The exporters have an
incentive to change its denomination currency from the third currency to the exporters’ currency if µ =
5 or 7.5 but do not if µ = 10. When β = 0.9875, Vt 0 = 348.77, Vt E = 348.62, and VtI = 348.72 when µ
= 10; Vt 0 = 358.95, Vt E = 358.91, and VtI = 358.94 when µ = 7.5; Vt 0 = 379.93, Vt E = 379.95, and VtI
= 379.94 when µ = 5. The exporters have an incentive to change its denomination currency from the
third currency to the exporters’ currency if µ = 5 but do not if µ = 10 or 7.5. Note that the parameter µ
becomes large when the importers’ local market is competitive. Because of less differentiated
products, competitive local market is more relevant for exporters in developing countries. It is
therefore more likely that the exporters continue the third currency pricing as inertia in developing
countries.

In the calibrations, we also tried varieties of normal distributions with different variances. The
essential results were, however, the same.
13

As in the static model, the risk averse exporters are always better off under the exporters’ currency
pricing than under any other currency pricing in the long-run. Therefore, even in the dynamic Nash
equilibrium model, a coordination failure may make the equilibrium currency pricing less efficient.
However, unlike in the static model, not only expectations but also history plays a key role in
determining the equilibrium currency pricing. The exporters know that moving from the third
currency pricing to the exporters’ currency pricing is desirable in the long-run. However, they also
know that majority of the other exporters cannot change the past currency pricing rule in the short-run.
History therefore discourages their incentive to change the currency pricing role. The role of history
becomes particularly important when the price settings are very heterogeneous, when the future profits
are discounted, and when the local market is competitive.
In most developing countries, the US dollar has historically been the dominant vehicle currency.
This has been true even when the other developed countries are another trade partners for the
developing countries. Once a country’s currency is established as an invoice currency, a large change
in economic environment is necessary to replace it, even if the relative economic power of that
country has declined in world trade. In the long-run, it would be more efficient for the exporters to
change their invoice currency from the vehicle currency to their own currency. To achieve the longrun goal, changing their expectations is an important factor. However, when history does matter,
making the firms less myopic and increasing their competitiveness would be the other important
factors to improve their welfare.

6. The Model with Backward-looking Price Setters
In the last section, we investigated a dynamic Nash equilibrium where all of the new price setters
change the expectations simultaneously. However, given that all of the exporters had fixed their
prices in the third currency until period 0, it is less likely that all of the new price setters would
suddenly change their expectations on currency pricing after period 1. Instead, it is more likely that
some of the new price setters form backward-looking expectations at period 1. Only forward-looking
leaders would change the expectations at period 1 and that the other new price setters would follow
the leaders after period 2. The purpose of this section is to investigate a dynamic equilibrium under
such expectation formation with inertia.
As in the last section, all of the exporters had fixed their prices in the third currency until period 0.
However, unlike in the last section, we assume that a fraction α of the new price setters (0 < α < 1)
observed a sunspot at the beginning of period 1. Only those who observed the sunspot fix their prices
in the exporters’ currency at period 1 and form new expectations that all of the new price setters
would follow the currency pricing after period 2. If the new expectations are self-fulfilling, switching
from the third currency pricing to the extorters’ currency pricing at period 1 would be a new
14

equilibrium. Otherwise, the third currency pricing would remain the only equilibrium even after
period 1. When the fraction α is large enough, it still holds that EU (Πt E) < EU (Πt o) for t < T* and
that EU (Πt E) > EU (Πt o) for t ≥ T*, where 1 < T* < H. However, T* becomes larger as α become
smaller. This is because a fraction 1-α of the exporters, who had chosen the third currency pricing at
period 1, cannot change their currency pricing until period H+1.
Like the last section, we specify the utility function of the exporters as U (Π ) ≡

Π /2 and choose

the parameter set such that η = 3, µ = 7.5, A = 1, and B = 10 in the calibration. Unlike the last section,
we set that H = 5 (so that the unit of time is monthly). The use of the lower value of H is to
demonstrate whether history matters or not even if the price setters are less heterogeneous. Without
backward-looking price setters (that is, when α = 1), the new expectations would be self-fulfilling
unless β is unreasonably small. However, when α is less than 1, the new expectations may not be
self-fulfilling even if β is close to one.
We calculated the utilities of the exporters for 10,000 random samples of exchange rates, assuming
that the changes of the exchange rates follow standard normal distribution with zero mean. Table 6
reports the calibrated values of Vt E, Vt I, and Vt 0 for alternative values of α and β. When α = 1, Vt E
exceeds both Vt I and Vt 0 if β is greater than 0.71. When α = 0.9, Vt E still exceeds both Vt I and Vt 0 if
β is greater than 0.82. This implies that the expectations are self-fulfilling under reasonable discount
factors if most of the new price setters observe the sunspot at the beginning of period 1. In contrast,
when α = 0.75, neither Vt E nor Vt I exceeds Vt 0 even if β = 1. This implies that more than three-fourth
of the new price setters need to be forward-looking leaders at period 1 for the exporters’ currency to
be a new equilibrium. Some intermediate case arises when α is equal to 0.8. The exporters have an
incentive to change its denomination currency from the third currency to the exporters’ currency if β
is greater than 0.97 but do not if β is less than 0.955. In the intermediate case, the discount rate plays
a critical role on the choice of currency pricing.
When we change the value of H to be 1 (that is, no price staggering), the calibration shows that Vt E
always exceeds both Vt I and Vt 0 if α ≥ 0.47. Therefore, in the static framework, the exporters’
currency can be a new equilibrium even when half of the new price setters are backward-looking. In
contrast, the exporters’ currency can be a new equilibrium in the dynamic framework with staggered
price setting even if much larger fraction of the new price setters are forward-looking. This happens
because not only backward-looking price setters but also non-price setters keep the old currency
pricing when the prices are staggered. This implies that the role of history becomes dominant in the
staggered price setting even when a relatively small fraction of the new price setters are backwardlooking. It is true even if the degree of heterogeneity is not large.

15

In practice, firm’s pricing (invoicing) contract is at most several months. Therefore, when the value
of H is large, we need to set the interpretation of the time unit reasonably short. In particular, when
the time unit is reasonably short, a realistic discount factor β would be very close to one. The above
results thus suggest that the existence of backward-looking price setters will provide more reasonable
environments where history plays a key role in determining the equilibrium currency pricing.
However, our results also suggest that unless the value of H is very small, a fraction of backwardlooking setters need not be so large.

7. Concluding Remarks
This paper investigated the choice of invoice currency under exchange rate uncertainty. The
analysis was motivated by the fact that the U.S. dollar has historically been the dominant vehicle
currency in developing countries. When the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to
set their prices not to deviate from those of the competitors. As a result, when the other exporters are
expected to set their prices in a third currency, the exporting firm tends to choose the third currency as
an equilibrium invoice currency. In particular, in the staggered price-setting framework, history
becomes a key determinant of the equilibrium currency pricing when the firms discount future profits,
particularly in the competitive local market, and when there are backward-looking price setters.
For analytical tractability, we used several assumptions in the model. Although the simplified
assumptions allowed us to focus an essential aspect on the determinants of currency pricing, our paper
may have neglected several other important aspects. For example, we solely focused on the case
where exporters have monopoly power but importers do not. The model of monopolistic competition
where exporters have monopoly power is standard in literature and may make it easy to compare our
results with previous studies. However, importers have monopoly power in some international trades
from developing countries to developed countries. If importers have monopoly power, the importers’

currency pricing (local currency pricing, LCP) may be more likely to be chosen when the market
is less competitive. The extension is our important agenda for our future researches. Our
analysis also relied on several specific functional forms. It is worthwhile to note that exchange
rate volatilities play no role in determining the equilibrium invoice currency under the specific
functional forms. However, exchange rate volatilities can affect the equilibrium choice of invoice
currency under more general functional forms. If this is the case, which exchange rate regime the
exporters’ country adopts might be an important determinant of the invoice currency.
One of the motivations of the paper was based on the fact that the US dollar has been the dominant
invoice currency in several East Asian countries. However, the dominant role of the US dollar had
also prevailed in Japanese exports until very recently. As Japanese economy showed remarkable

16

growth, the role of Japan’s exports in international trade increased substantially in the 1960s and the
1970s. The share of the Japanese Yen’s denomination in the Japan’s exports, however, had been
negligible until the early 1970s. Table 7 reports time-series data of invoice currency data in Japan’s
exports. The Yen’s invoice ratios were close to zero in the early 1970s and were less than 20%
throughout the 1970s. It was 1983 when the Yen’s share exceeded 40% in the Japan’s exports to the
world. But the Yen’s invoice ratios were not far above 40% even in the early 1990s and declined
below 40% throughout the 1990s. The Yen’s ratios in the exports were not high even for East Asia,
although they were slightly higher than for the rest of the world.
In explaining the determinants of invoice currencies in Japan’s exports, we may point out several
factors that were not discussed in the paper. The first is the heavy reliance of Japan’s exports on the
United States. Since only a small fraction (16 percent in 1991) of Japanese exports to the United
States are invoiced in the yen and since a large fraction of Japanese exports go to the United States,
the structure of Japan’s exports leads to relatively low yen-denominated invoice currency ratios in
Japan’s total exports. The structure may affect the choice of invoice currency on Japan’s exports to the
other countries. The second is the relatively small size of the short-term capital market in Japan.
Although its volume has been increasing recently, the size of the treasury bill market in Japan is still
much smaller than in the United States. Since the short-term capital market would be where foreign
investors would park their yen-denominated funds, its limited size reduces the invoice currency ratio
of the yen in trade. The third is the role of Japan’s large trading companies, which handle the bulk of
Japanese exports and imports. Since these companies have a relative advantage in avoiding foreign
exchange risks, their existence may lead to relatively low yen-denominated invoice currency ratios in
Japan’s total exports. However, in addition to these factors, it is likely that both history and
expectations have been the important factors. Due to the previous economic power, the U.S. dollar
still plays an important role in Japan’s international trade. The expectations support the inertia.
Although Japan’s economic power in world trade has risen, it would be a long way for the yen to be
the key currency in world trade.

Equations (1)-(3) and (6) imply that ∂ΠE/∂ P* = ∂ΠI/∂ P* = ∂Π0/∂ P*, ∂2ΠI/∂ P*∂ s = ∂2Π0/∂ P*∂ s
and ∂2ΠE/∂2 P* = ∂2ΠI/∂2 P* = ∂2Π0/∂2 P* at s0 = E s0 and s = E s. It thus holds that when ∂P*/∂ s = 0,

Since equation (10) lead to

(A7) [E U(ΠI) - E U (ΠE)]/ U′(Π*) = (1/2) [(Π11I - Π11E) σ02 + (Π22I - Π22E) σ2],
we can derive that
