    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper uses wavelets to decompose each stock\u2019s trading-volume variance into frequency-specific components. We find that stocks dominated by short-run fluctuations in trading volume have abnormal returns that are 1% per month higher than otherwise similar stocks where short-run fluctuations in volume are less important\u2014i.e., stocks with less of a short-run tilt. And, we document that a stock\u2019s short-run tilt can change rapidly from month to month, suggesting that these abnormal returns are not due to some persistent firm characteristic that\u2019s simultaneously adding both short-run fluctuations and long-term risk.\n\n",
