FLOWS OF KNOWLEDGE FROM
UNIVERSITIES AND FEDERAL LABS :
MODELING THE FLOW OF PATENT
CITATIONS OVER TIME AND ACROSS
INSTITUTIONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC
BOUNDARIES

ABSTRACT

The extent to which new technological knowledge flows across institutional

and national

boundaries is a question of great importance for public policy and the modeling of economic growth,
This paper develops a model of the process generating subsequent citations to patents as a lens for
viewing knowledge diffusion. We find that the probability of patent citation over time after a patent
is granted fits well to a double-exponential

function that can be interpreted

as the mixture of

diffusion and obsolescence functions, The results indicate that diffusion is geographically localized.
Controlling for other factors, within-country

citations are more numerous and come more quickly

than those that cross country boundaries.

Third, the larger number

of patents allows us to enrich the geographic portrait by examining separately the diffusion of
knowledge from U.S. institutions to inventors in Canada, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world.
Finally, our earlier work took the act of citation as exogenous, and simply measured how often
that citation came from nearby. In this paper we develop a modelling framework that allows the
generation

of citations from multiple distinct locations to be generated by a random process

whose parameters we estimate.

extremely rich mine of information about individual inventive acts and the links among them as

We have discussed elsewhere at great length the advantages and disadvantages

of using

patents and patent citations to indicate inventions and knowledge links among inventions (Jtie,

Hence the appearance of a citation indicates that the cited patent is, in some sense, a

antecedent of the citing patent. Patent applicants bear a legal obligation to disclose

any knowledge that they might have of relevant prior inventions, and the patent examiner may
also add citations not identified by the applicant.
Our basic goal in this paper is to explore the process by which citations to a given patent

relies on U.S. patents in this sense. Currently about half of U.S. patents are granted to foreigners. Hence, later
in the paper, we will use the phrase “U.S. patents” to mean patents granted to residents of the U. S., as opposed
to those granted to foreigners.

in

citations to university and government patents. We recognize that much of the research that goes
on at both universities and government laboratories never results in patents, and presumably has
impacts that cannot be traced via our patent-citations-bwed

research.

We believe, however, that

at least with respect to relatively near-term economic impacts, patents and their citations are at
least a useful window into the otherwise “black box” of the spread of scientific and technical
knowledge.
The analysis in this paper is based on the citations made to 3 distinct sets of “potentially
cited” patents.

The first set is a 1-in-10 random sample of all patents granted between 1963 and

1990 and assigned to U.S. corporations

(88,257 patents).

The second set is the universe of all

patents granted between 1965 and 1990 to U.S. Urtiversities, based on a set of assignees identified
by the Patent OffIce as being universities or related entities such as teaching hospitals (10,761
patents),’

Some simple statistics from these data are presented in Table One. On average, university
patents are more highly cited, despite the fact that more of them are recent.b Federal patents are
fess highly cited than corporate patents.

But it is difficult to know how to interpret these

averages, because many different effects all contribute to these means.

To the extent that citation practices vary across fields, differences in citation intensities by type

The dependence of the

attributes of both the cited and citing patents.

In this paper, we consider the following

of this formulation,

we plot the average citation fmctions

(citation frequency as a function of time elapsed from the potentially cited patent), for each of
the 5 geographic

regions (Figure One) and each of the 3 institutional

groups (Figure Two).’

These figures show that citations show a pattern of gradual diffusion and ultimate obsolescence,
with maximal citation frequency occurring after about 5 years. The contrasts across groups and
countries in these raw averages are striking:

U.S. patents are much more likely to cite our 3

groups of U.S. patents than are any other locations, with an apparent ranking among other regions

All of the estimation is carried out including a “base” value for ~1 md ~2, with all other

Hence the integral over time (i.e. the total number

of citations per patent) will also be 40°4 larger.
We can think of the overall rate of citation intensity measured by variations in a to be
composed of two parts,

Citation intensity is the product of the “fertility” (Caballero and Jaffe,

1993) of the underlying ideas in spawning future technological
“size” of a patent, i.e. how much of the unobservable

developments,12 ~d the average

12. The “fertility” label for differences in the likelihood of citations is just evocative language suggesting that
technological developments, or as providing the grounds
cited patents can be thought as “giving birth” to ftier
on which such subsequent applications grow. ‘Importance” is a term that we have used in this context in
previous work, and refers to the fact that patents that collect more citations over time are deemed on that basis
to be more “important”, Since differences in a are time-independent,
the integral over time would also be higher
or lower by the same factor, and hence the equivalence with this notion of “importance.”

into these two components. 13
In the c=e of a(K), that is, when the multiplicative

factor varies with attributes of the

cifing patents, variations in it should be interpreted as differences in the “propensity to cite” (or
in the probability

of making a citation) of patents in a particular category vis a vis the base

category of the citing patents. If, for example, a(K=Europe)

is 0.5, this means that the average

patent granted to European inventors is half as likely as a patent granted to inventors residing in
the US to cite any given US patent.

(again, by attributes of either the cited or the citing patents) imply

differences in the rate of decay or “obsolescence”

across categories of patents. Higher values of

~1 mean higher rates of decay, which pull the citations function downwards

and leftward. In

other words, the likelihood of citations would be lower everywhere for higher ~1 ‘s, and would
peak earlier on.

Thus a higher a means more citations at all lags; a lower ~1 means more

citations at later lags.
When both a(k, K) and ~1 (k, K) vary, the citation function can shift upward at some
lags while

If we compute the ratio of the likelihood of citations for patents in electronics relative

to those in “all other” using these parameters, we find that 1 year after being granted patents in
electronics are 89°/0 more likely to be cited, but 12 years down the road the frequencies for the
two groups are about the same, and at a lag of 20 years Electronics patents are actually 36°A less
likely to be cited than patents in the base category.

for other factors, was twice as high in 1989 as in 1977.’5 This reflects a well known

institutional phenomenon, namely, the increasing propensity to make citations at the patent office,
apparently associated with the computerization

of the patent file and of the operations of patent

examiners. Thus, these coefficients serve strictly as controls, and as very important ones for that
matter, given the magnitude

of the changes over time.

Without these controls, obsolescence

would appear to be much slower (since our only observations

on long lags come from recent

citing years), and foreign countries would appear to make more citations (relative to U.S.), since
the foreign share of patents has increased dramatically over the time period.

The variations in a by technological fields indicate that patents in Drugs and Medical and
in Electronics are 36-40°/0 more likely to be cited than in other fields. In addition to the fertility
and patent-size effects discussed above, it may also be the cme that differences across fields stem
in part from variations in citation practices

across fields. As we shall see in the next section, the results of the model where

these fields. Thus, there is reason to believe that the findings here do reflect real differences

in their relative citation intensity (from 72°/0

period. Their overall lower fertility level may be due to the fact that these labs had been
traditionally

quite isolated from mainstream commercial innovations,

and thus those innovations

that they did choose to patent were in some sense marginal. By the same token the upward trend
in the fertility ratio may be due to the increasing “openness” of federd labs, and their efforts to
reach out and make their innovations more commercially oriented. However, for the time being,
and until we gather additional evidence, this interpretation

must be regarded as conjectural.

highest with a coefficient of 0.65, followed by Europe with 0.5, and Japan with 0.44. (The fifth
category, ROW, contains a small number of patents from a large number of other countries, and
hence it is difficult to interpret.)
Thus these data do not support the claim that Japan is particularly
technological

advances made in the US (as has been often suggested),

apt at exploiting

In fact, patents granted

to Japanese inventors are less than half as likely to make citations to US patents than patents
granted to U.S. residents. Once again, if we interpret a citation as an indication that the citing
patent “builds upon” the cited patent (or as evidence of a spillover from the cited to the citing
patent), then our results indicate that, at least in the realm of patented inventions,

Japanese

inventors draw from US inventions much less than do U.S. residents. 19
Finally, the estimate of ~1 = 0.2 means that the citation functions reaches its maximum
at about 5 years. This estimate is not surprising, given the empirical citation distributions

shown

in Figures One and Two. The R2 of 0.52 is fairly high for models of this kind, suggesting that
the postulated double exponential combined with the effects that we have identified fit the data

19. From a purely statistical perspective, one cannot rule out the interpretation that Japanese inventors rely on
U.S. inventions as much as their U.S. counterparts, but somehow manage to avoid citing them, Since the
examiners are the ultimate arbiters of what citations appear on the patents, this would require that U, S, patent
examiners are differentially lax in their duties vis A vis Japanese inventors, This seems unlikely.

5.2 The Full Model: Allowing

~1 to vary

We present in Table 4 the results from the estimation

of the full model, including

variations in ~1. We discuss below each set of results sepmately,2]

In addition to the multiplicative

factor, a~, we allow now for

variations in ~ 1 according to the technological field of the cited patent. Thus, for example, field
3, Electronics,

Optics and Nuclear technology

has a coefficient

a(g=3)

= 2.00, meaning that

patents in this field are likely to get twice as many citations as in the base field “All Other”, and
70-88% more than in the four other fields. However, its ~1 is 30% higher than that of the base,
which means that the rate of citations to these patents decays faster than for others, and thus the
initial “citation advantage” fades quickly over time.
The effect of allowing these joint variations in a and ~1 is shown graphically in Figure
Three.

The Figure shows that both models yield

parameters that predict a greater overall rate of citation of these patents than the base group.
Allowing ~1 to vary shows, however, that this greater overall citation intensity is not uniform
over time. These patents are much more highly cited in the first few years, but also show faster
obsolescence,

so that in later years they are actually less highly cited than the base group.

Figure Four shows the citation functions for each of the Technological

Fields.

Because

the relative frequencies are difficult to see on the graph at higher lags, Part (A) of Table Five
also gives the value of the ratio of the citation probability of each of the technological

fields to

the citation probability of the base field, at different lags, i.e. 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 years after the
granting of the cited patents.

Looking once again at Electronics,

we see that the ratio starts

indeed very high, 1.89, but after 12 years it is the same as the base field, after 20 years it

20. It is interesting that the fit of the unweighed model is considerably poorer, with an R2 of about 15 percent.
Recall that there are a significant number of observations with zero observed citition frequency, for which the
model canot tit for plausible parame~r values. These observations correspond, however, to cells with few
potentially cited and/or citing patents, and hence they get reduced weight in the weighted regression, thus
improving the overall fit.

CONCLUSION
The computerization

of patent citations data provides an exciting opportunity to examine

the links among inventions

and inventors, over time, space, technology

and institutions.

The

ability to look at very large numbers of patents and citations allows us to begin to decompose
overall citation

flows in ways that better reflect reality.

This paper represents

an initial

exploration of these data. Many variations that we have not explored are possible, but this initial
foray provides some intriguing results,

Interestingly,

we do not find that university patents are, to any

The list of additional questions that could be examined with these data and this kind of

First, it would be interesting to examine if the geographic localization

that

we give to the geographic results could be strengthened by examining patents granted in the U.S.
