Can Policy Facilitate Partial Retirement? Evidence from Germany

NBER Working Paper No. 21478
August 2015
JEL No. J26
ABSTRACT
In 1996, Germany introduced the Altersteilzeit (ATZ) law, which encouraged longer working lives
through partial retirement incentives. Using matched pension system and establishment survey data,
we estimate changes in part-time employment and retirement after ATZ. We find the policy induced
growth in part-time work for men and extended men's expected duration of employment by 1.8 years.
As the policy evolved to include an abrupt retirement option, the worklife gain for men fell to 1.2 years.
Among women, part-time employment grew less and employment duration changed little initially
but later declined by 0.2 years when abrupt retirement became available.

1. Introduction
Population aging has important economic consequences. From 1992 to
2002, the share of older workers in the U.S. labor force increased from 12% to
14% and is expected to reach 26% by 2022 (Toossi 2013). In European countries
the situation is more critical because birth rates are among the lowest in the world,
life expectancies are among the highest, and trends towards earlier retirement and
longer life expectancies exacerbate the demographic transition (“Pensions at a
Glance 2013: OECD and G20 Indicators” 2013). From 1965 to 1995, average
retirement age for men fell by 4.4 years in Germany as compared to 1.9 years in
the U.S. (Gendell 1998).
The aging workforce raises concerns about the solvency of public pension
systems and creates a need to explore policy options that may extend working life.
Finding cost effective ways to incentivize longer working lives among older
workers is one way to ease current demographic pressures (Maestas and
Zissimopoulos 2010).To encourage later transitions out of working life, some
countries have created incentives for partial retirement with the aim of postponing
full retirement. Recently, average effective retirement ages have risen in many
European countries and partial retirement may have played an important role in
enabling longer work lives (Comeau and Latulippe 2015). Yet, these policies may
instead crowd out years that would have been spent in full time employment,
without postponing retirement (Gustman and Steinmeier 2008). To date seven
European countries have enacted partial retirement policies, but there are few
rigorous empirical studies of their effects (Eurofound 2014). 1 In this paper we
investigate Germany's partial retirement policy.

1

Some European articles call these "progressive retirement policies" (Eurofound 2014). These are
separate from partial pension policies, which allow workers who have reached pensionable age to
continue working and receive a portion of their pension benefits if earnings remain below the
"earnings test" threshold.

3

Studying German policies, as we do here, is especially important because
Germany is “the first and biggest test” of the effects of population aging (Elliot
and Kollewe 2011). Germany's population aged 15 to 64 is projected to fall 23
percent by 2050, compared to an overall population decline of 13 percent (Fuchs,
Söhnlein, and Weber 2008). Germany’s demographic challenges have been
featured in the U.S. media because the U.S. is projected to face similar challenges
in the future (Daley and Kulish 2013). In addition, as the largest economy in
Europe, Germany’s continued economic success is critical to Europe and the
global economy.
We examine changes in part-time employment and retirement associated
with incentives for partial retirement introduced in Germany through the 1996
Altersteilzeit (ATZ) policy. ATZ set compensation floors for partial retirees, aged
55 and older, and provided subsidies to employers if they replaced partial retirees'
work hours by hiring unemployed workers or trainees. Our information comes
from a particularly rich source of matched employer-employee administrative
data: the Linked Employer Employee Data of the Institute for Employment
Research (LIAB). The LIAB offers the unique advantage of matching survey data
from a national stratified random sample of German establishments to social
security records for all establishment employees covered by the social security
system. We estimate changes in part-time employment and retirement hazard
rates in a difference-in-differences framework using before and after policy
variation and exploiting the age cutoff of 55.
The estimates suggest that the ATZ policy was initially successful,
especially for men. It was associated with large increases in part-time
employment among 55-61 year old males, with a peak increase of 20 percentage
points at age 61. Since this growth largely occurred among persons who would
have otherwise been retired, male worklives were extended by 1.8 years, and fulltime employment by 0.8 years. In combination, these results indicate that the

4

policy significantly increased working time among 55 to 65 year old men.
Conversely, there were no important changes in worklife duration among women.
However, as the ATZ policy evolved, many men and women were able to use an
increasingly expansive definition of partial retirement to achieve earlier abrupt
departures from work while technically remaining employed, as described below.
Once these opportunities became popular, the average worklife extension of
males fell to a (still substantial) 1.2 years, but females worked 0.2 fewer years,
and full-time 1.2 years less than before the ATZ policy was implemented. These
disparate results point to the importance of careful policy design which focuses on
the incentives inherent in specific aspects of the programs implemented.

2. The ATZ Policy
Early retirement was very common in Germany in the early 1990s.
Between 1993 and 1995, approximately 25% of men left the labor force by age 56
between 1993 and 1995 (Borsch-Supan and Schnabel 1997). A common path for
these retirements involved an abrupt transition from full-time work to retirement,
supported through the unemployment insurance system, and then followed by the
claiming of Old Age pensions. In the 1990s, Germany (as well as many other
developed countries) addressed the unsustainable early retirement patterns by
raising pensionable ages and reducing access to unemployment insurance.
Germany also introduced incentives for gradual, later, transitions from working
life to retirement through the ATZ policy.
ATZ had three goals. First, it was intended to promote gradual transitions
between work and retirement. The second was to extend working lives by offering
an alternative to abrupt (early) retirement. Third, it was intended to encourage the
employment of unemployed workers and trainees as older persons retired. We
examine the extent to which the ATZ achieved the first two of these objectives.

5

To accomplish these goals, the law set compensation and pension
contribution floors for partial retirees, aged 55 and older, who reduced work hours
by 50% over a 3 to 10 year period and had worked at least 1,080 days in the
previous 5 years in jobs covered by the social security system (though not
necessarily all with the same employer). Specifically, ATZ required partial
retirees be paid at minimum 70% of prior (pre-partial retirement) earnings and
pension benefits accrue at a minimum of 90% of the rate obtained under full-time
work. Also, wage earnings in excess of 50% of prior earnings were exempt from
income taxes. ATZ participants were eligible for full Old Age Pension benefits at
age 60. 2 While this seems too early to promote extensions of working lives in the
current German context, the modal retirement age in Germany when the ATZ was
introduced was 58.
Finally, ATZ made federal subsidies available to help employers meet the
new compensation floors. These subsidies were equivalent to 20% of former fulltime wages and 40% of full-time pension contributions, but were only paid if
employers replaced partial retirees' hours by hiring an unemployed worker or
trainee. In practice, few employers applied for subsidies and anecdotal evidence
suggests that employers offered ATZ opportunities without subsidization because
it was a legal way to reduce workforce and manage demographic transition
(Schmähl 2003).
The effects of ATZ were not immediate because the policy required
employers and employees to establish agreements that outline the terms for partial
retirement arrangements, usually as part of a collective agreement. Collective
bargaining in Germany generally takes place regionally at the industry level and
approximately 58% of the workforce is covered by collective agreements (Peter

2

After an amendment passed in 2004, the pensionable age gradually increased to 65.

6

Ellguth and Kohaut 2015). In many industries, the pay and pension contributions
negotiated exceeded the ATZ minimums. 3
Six other European countries have laws similar to Germany's ATZ, and
three others have institutionalized corresponding incentives through the collective
bargaining system (Eurofound 2014). Existing studies suggest the effects of
partial retirement policies on part-time employment vary from country to country.
Some previous investigations of Germany's law found little or no effect on parttime work because the number of subsidies paid to employers was quite low
(Trampusch 2005). Yet, other studies indicate the majority of partial retirements
were not subsidized , and so are not captured by looking only at subsidy payments
(Brussig, Knuth, and Wojtkowski 2009). Using German data , Wanger (2010)
reports approximately 16% of all newly retired individuals were ATZ
participants. Huber, Lechner, and Wunsch (2013) estimate workers ages 51 to 60
in firms that offered partial retirement opportunities spent an average of 6 to 9
months more in part-time employment than those in firms that did not.
Policies permitting work hours reductions to be made across months or
years (like Germany's did) were more popular than those requiring decreases on a
daily or weekly basis (Latulippe and Turner 2000). However, such flexible
policies also created a loophole leading to de facto early retirement arrangements
that qualified for partial retirement incentives. For example, an employee who
continued to work full-time for 1.5 years and not at all for the next 1.5 years
would meet the ATZ requirement of a 50% reduction in working time over a
minimum of 3 years. In Germany these were known as Block Model
arrangements. Critics argued that the use of ATZ for Block Model arrangements
subsidized early abrupt transitions from work rather than encouraging gradual

negotiated during our study period.

7

later retirements as desired, but to our knowledge there has been no formal
empirical evaluation of these claims (Schmähl 2003).
Previous studies provide conflicting evidence about whether partial
retirement incentives extend working life. Sunden (1994) and Wadensjö (2006)
concluded that Sweden's program led to a net increase in labor supply among
older workers. Conversely, Graf, Hofer, and Winter-Ebmer (2011) found that
Austria's partial retirement policy primarily crowded out full-time employment,
resulting in a net reduction in labor supply. Estimates of Germany's ATZ policy
are also conflicting. Brussig, Knuth, and Wojtkowski's (2009) descriptive analysis
of retirement behavior among ATZ participants in Germany indicated the average
age at retirement among participants was above that of non-participants. Using the
same data as in this paper, and analyzing firms introducing partial retirement
agreements between 2000 and 2002 in response to ATZ, Huber, Lechner, and
Wunsch (2013) found that workers spent less time unemployed before retiring
when their firm offered partial retirement opportunities, but that they used Block
Model arrangements to end work as early as others had before ATZ. 4
We contribute a new analysis of the ATZ policy that differs from existing
studies in four key ways. First, we define (part-time) partial retirement broadly to
include all part-time work, whereas many previous estimates were restricted to
federally subsidized arrangements, few of which were part-time models. Second,
we analyze a representative sample of establishment employees 50 to 65 years old
over the 1993 to 2004 period. This allows us to include early and later adopting
firms in our analysis. Third, we model age-specific policy effects for workers age
50 through 65 years old before and after ATZ, permitting a careful examination of
trends in behavior below the age 55 threshold and prior to the policy, as well as
4

Their analysis pools policy effects across workers ages 51 to 60 and excludes firms that reached
agreements prior to 2000, which as shown in Appendix Table A2 includes a substantial number of
industries. As shown below, the Block Model was less important in the earlier years of the ATZ
than in the period they study.

8

impacts of the policy up through the statutory retirement age. Modeling age
specific effects in this way is important because many firms rationed partial
retirement opportunities so that the average age of entry was 57 (Caliendo and
Hogenacker 2012), and the policy effects may persist beyond age 60. Fourth, we
separate the post ATZ period into years before the Block Model was widely used
and years after. Separating the post policy periods allows us to simulate how the
policy may have affected labor market behavior if the Block Model had not
become the dominant form of partial retirement.
3. Data and Empirical Strategy
Our analysis sample is drawn from the Linked Employer Employee Data
of the Institute for Employment Research (LIAB) cross-sectional model. 5 The
LIAB links establishment survey information to individual employment spell data
using social security records for all employees covered by the social security
system and employed in a surveyed establishment on June 30th of each year. 6
Approximately 80% of the German workforce is subject to social security;
excluded categories include civil servants, family workers, and marginal
workers. 7 The data span 1993 through 2010. Employed individuals in sampled
establishments and job seekers are included in the data; retirees are not.
The establishment sample is designed to be representative of the German
economy in each year within establishment size (employment), industry, and the
state (Bundesland) strata. The data contain survey responses from 4,000 to 14,000
establishments per year linked to employment spell data for between 1.6 and 2.6
million individuals.
5

Detailed information about the LIAB cross sectional model and associated data sets is available
in (Heining, Scholz, and Seth 2013).
6
Other linkages are available but this "cross sectional model" is based on a stratified random
sample of surveyed establishments and was chosen for this study to produce representative
estimates of the policy.
7
Marginal workers are persons with temporary employment contracts whose earnings through the
marginal employment job fall below legislated thresholds. They are exempt from many of the
employment protection and mandated benefits policies in Germany.

3.1. Analytic Sample
Our analytic sample contains data from 1993 through 2004 for 50 to 65
year olds. We exclude years after 2004 because stepwise increases in pensionable
age for partial retirees were announced in 2004, and the data suggest dramatic
changes in partial retirement participation in response to them. We end the
analysis at age 65 because so few older individuals remain in the labor force. 8 We
include 50 to 54 year olds to allow for changes in employment behavior below the
ATZ eligibility threshold since these may influence our interpretation of policy
estimates among 55 to 65 year olds. Employment information for East German
establishments is provided from 1993 onward and so both East and West German
establishments are included in our analysis, with the state in which the
establishment is located controlled for in all specifications (Heining, Scholz, and
Seth 2013).
The LIAB is organized as spell data. 9 We retain all spells of employment
and partial retirement for workers ages 50 to 65 and convert the data to a panel of
person-year observations. In doing so, we lose some information about the
specific timing of retirements, but this is necessary because employers only report
work schedule information on the annual notification, as detailed below. In cases
where an employee is employed in more than one establishment in the same year,
we include information from the longest spell only. 10 With these restrictions, our

8

The number of person-year observations in our data at age 65 is approximately 7% of the number
at age 60. At age 66, it falls to 0.8%.
9
In the cross-sectional model, administrative information from social security records for all
employment spells that include June 30th of each calendar year are included on the file. Each
observation in the data set refers to a separate spell of employment. Multiple spells per person per
year are possible, for example multiple job holders and employees who change jobs will have
multiple spells. Detailed information about the cross-sectional LIAB are provided in Heining,
Scholz, and Seth (2013)
10
Multiple spells are not common in our study population – for example, less than 3% of spells
were excluded for this reason in 1993.

10

analytic sample contains 3,643,954 person-year observations of men and
1,920,232 of women.
3.2. Construction of Dependent Variables
We focus on two binary dependent variables: part-time employment and
retirement. These measures are created from the notifications employers are
statutorily required to provide to the social security system. Employers report
part-time work on an annual basis. They do not provide precise work hours, but
rather indicate: a schedule that is less than usual full-time hours but is at least
50% of them; or a schedule that is less than 50% of usual full-time hours. Our
measure of part-time employment is equal to zero in all years employees are
reported as working full-time and one when working either of these part-time
schedules. We do not distinguish between the two part-time schedules because
ATZ allowed for a wide variety of work arrangements. Restricting focus to
arrangements where employees work less than 50% of weekly full-time hours
might exclude some portions of partial retirement spells and obscure the timing of
policy responses. It is also worth noting that Block Model participants are always
coded as zero, for this variable, because they never reduce work hours.
Retirement is defined using the notifications employers are required to file
at the end of an employment relationship. We construct a variable equal to zero in
all calendar years until an end of employment notification is filed and one in the
year it is filed. Because individuals are only included in the LIAB while employed
in sampled establishments, they are no longer in the data after this point unless
they happen to be re-employed in another sampled establishment. Thus, end of
employment need not coincide with Old Age Pension claiming, since some
individuals could take a new job in an establishment outside of the sample or
postpone pension claiming. This is unlikely to be a major concern. Although the
data do not contain information on pension benefit receipt; in our analytic sample,
observations of workers in their first year of employment with an establishment

11

constitute only 2% of person-year observations among individuals 50 and above,
suggesting that few older persons start new employment (rather than retiring)
after ending a job.
Block Model participants are classified as employed during the Release
Phase, even though they are no longer working. Our retirement measure is equal
to zero until the last year of the Release Phase to reflect the continuation of the
employment relationship. However, as explained below, we also adjust simulated
survival rates to produce survival functions that exclude Block Model Release
Phase participants, so as to differentiate between end of employment and end of
work.
3.3. Construction of the ATZ Policy Variable
Although the ATZ was introduced in 1996, and the compensation floors
took effect then, participation was very low until 1999. Figure 1 plots the ratios of
daily wages received in the first year of a part-time employment spell to the fulltime daily wage earned in the prior year. There is a discrete change in 1997,
consistent with the wage floors introduced in the law. Yet very few people began
partial retirement prior to 1999 because industries seldom had partial retirement
clauses in place before 1998. Table 1 reports the month and year clauses were
introduced into the collective bargaining contracts of selected major industries.
Appendix Table A2 provides the same information for a broader group of
industries, along with details about the terms negotiated. Our analysis of
collective bargaining agreements revealed that several industries negotiated
compensation above the ATZ floors, which explains why the ratio of part-time
wages to prior full-time wages in Figure 1 exceeds the federally required 0.7.
Figure 2 plots the trends in flows into part-time employment above and below the
age 55 threshold. The trends remain parallel until 1999, which suggests there was
no anticipation of enactment of the law and little effect for the first two years after
enactment. Figure 2 also shows that Block Model participation was negligible

12

prior to 2002, but grew rapidly thereafter. There was no change in the original
law. Instead, the Block Model interpretation of the ATZ work hours requirements
evolved primarily through the collective bargaining process and was not widely
applied until after 2001.
Given these institutional details and corresponding trends observed in the
data, our policy variable is constructed to reflect three distinct periods. We define
1993 through 1998 as the pre-ATZ period to reflect delayed implementation, 1999
to 2001 are "low Block Model" years, and 2002 through 2004 are "high Block
Model" years. Although, as shown in Figure 2, the share of new entrants using the
part-time model began to fall in 2001, Block Model participants constituted only
3% of all workers and 10% of partial retirees in 2001, and these shares rose to 7%
and 17% by 2002. 11 Distinguishing between high and low Block Model periods
allows us to examine the likely effects of a partial retirement policy on retirement
and simulated employment durations with and without the Block Model option.
We also test the robustness of our findings to excluding years 1996 through 1998
from the analysis, but given the pre-trends in part-time employment displayed in
Figure 2 our preferred specification includes these years in the pre-ATZ period.
3.4. Empirical Strategy
We estimate employment effects of the ATZ policy using a differencein-differences framework. Specifically, our control group consists of 50-54 year
olds, who are not directly affected by the program, while 55-65 year olds are
the treatment group. We compare changes in part-time work and retirement
rates for the baseline (1993-1998) and two post-policy (1991-2001 and 20022004) periods. As mentioned, effects in the two post-implementation periods
could differ because Block Model arrangements were rare in the earlier one but
more widely available subsequently.
11

Author's calculations. Partial retirees include all part-time workers ages 55 to 65, including
those that are not federally subsidized.

13

Effects of the ATZ policy may differ by age. The policy permitted
partial retirements as brief as 3 or as long as 10 years, and allowed persons
ending partial retirement spells to claim full old-age pension benefits at age 60.
Therefore, the greatest incentives for part-time employment might occur at or
near age 57 (three years prior to age 60). However, establishments were
permitted to cap the share of the workforce that could be partially retired. If
these opportunities were provided based on worker seniority, some workers
might first qualify at ages above 57 and they might then delay retirement past
60.
We allow effects of the ATZ to vary flexibly with age by interacting the
policy treatment-effects with individual age dummy variables, so that our
differences-in-differences estimation equation is:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃�𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1�𝑋𝑋�

= 𝑓𝑓�𝑏𝑏0 + 𝑏𝑏1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃1𝑡𝑡 + 𝑏𝑏2 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2𝑡𝑡 + 𝑏𝑏3 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

[1]

+ 𝑏𝑏6 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �

In Equation [1], E is one of our two dependent variables - part-time employment
or retirement, Indiv and Estab refer to individual and establishment
characteristics, Policy1 and Policy2 to the low Block Model and high Block
Model periods, Ageit is a vector of age dummy variables (with age 50 as the
excluded reference category), ε is an error term and the subscripts i, f and t index
the individual, establishment and year. When estimating Equation [1] with our
part-time dependent variable, the coefficient estimates are interpreted as changes
in part-time employment rates. When retirement is the outcome, Equation [1]
becomes a discrete time hazard model and the coefficient estimates indicate

14

changes in retirement hazard rates. All changes are relative to age 50 and the preATZ period 1993-1998.
The vector of individual characteristics, Indiv, includes age, educational
attainment, establishment tenure, and experience (since 1975 for West Germans
and 1990-1992 for East Germans), individual-specific statutory pensionable ages,
and the statutory ages for claiming early old-age pensions due to disability, long
term unemployment, or long service history. All statutory pensionable ages were
increasing during our study period as explained in the Section A1 of the
Appendix. 12 Our preferred specification omits controls for individual occupation
and daily wage because these are less plausibly exogenous than other personal
characteristics, but we conduct robustness checks with these covariates included
and results do not change materially. Estab includes the following time varying
covariates measured June 30th of each calendar year: total number of employees
in the establishment, the proportions who are trainees and employed part-time,
total establishment revenue in Euros, and vacancies. Estab also includes 17
industry dummy variables, and German federal state dummy variables
corresponding to the location of the establishment.
We stratify our estimates by gender, reflecting the very different rates of
part-time employment prior to ATZ: only 1% of men in our sample were working
part-time in 1993-1998 as compared to 31% of women. Pensionable ages also
differ for men and women during the study period and the attractiveness of ATZ
arrangements may depend on one's opportunities for abrupt retirement.
Additionally, employment across industries differs by gender. ATZ was primarily
implemented through the collective bargaining process which, in Germany,
12
As in the U.S., Germans may access reduced benefit pensions early or full benefits at the
pensionable age. We control for both ages in the analysis. These ages varied by birth month and
gender, and changed during our analysis period as documented in Appendix Table A1. Disabled
persons, the long term unemployed, and those with 35 of service had access pensions at younger
ages. These ages were also changing and are controlled for in our analysis.

15

generally produces industry level agreements. Many of the earliest partial
retirement clauses were enacted in male dominated industries (see Table 1).
We estimate Equation [1] using Probit estimation, with heteroskedasticity
robust standard errors clustered at the establishment level. Results are reported as
percentage point changes in part-time employment or retirement hazard rates,
computed as the mean of the individual marginal effects.
3.5. Simulated Employment Survival Rates and Durations
We simulated the effects of ATZ on duration of working lives as follows.
First, we take the vector of actual hazard rates in 1993-98 at ages 55 to 65 and
calculate the baseline survival function as:
𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗0 = 𝑆𝑆(𝑗𝑗−1)0 ∗ (1 − ℎ𝑗𝑗0 )

[2]

where Sj0 and hj0 are baseline employment survival and hazard rates at age j. Next,
we compute hazard rates in the two post-policy periods by adding to the baseline
hazard rates the regression-adjusted estimates of the change at each age and postpolicy period attributable to ATZ:
ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = ℎ𝑗𝑗0 + Δℎ𝑗𝑗𝑝𝑝

[3]

where p refers to the post-AZT period and Δℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the estimated change in the

hazard rate. Survival rates are then calculated analogously to equation [2] and the
computed survival rates are used to estimate changes in the duration of
employment, Dp, relative to the pre-ATZ period as:
65

𝐷𝐷𝑝𝑝 = � �𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗0 �
𝑗𝑗=55

[4]

where Sjp is the computed survival rate at age j for time period p, one of the two
post-ATZ time periods (1999-2001 or 2002-2004) and Sj0 is the corresponding
survival rate during the pre-policy period (1993-1998).
To compute full-time employment survival functions and changes in the
duration of full-time work we use actual pre-ATZ part-time employment rates at

16

each age in 1993-1998, and add to them the vector of estimated changes
attributable to ATZ in each post policy period to compute part-time employment
rates:
𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗0 + Δ𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

[5]

We then subtract the vectors of part-time employment rates in each period from
the computed survival rates to obtain the full-time employment survival rates, Fj,
and also subtract the share of workers in Block Model Release Phase, Rjp, at each
age to ensure Fjp captures only those who are actually working. Prior to 20022004, Rjp are all zero. 13
𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

[6]

Changes in the duration of full-time work, Wp, are computed as:
65

𝑊𝑊𝑝𝑝 = � �𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗0 �
𝑗𝑗=55

4. Descriptive Statistics
Table 2 contains selected descriptive statistics for our analytic sample by
time period and gender. Several of the descriptive statistics are noteworthy. First,
as mentioned previously, women have much higher rates of part-time
employment than men (31% versus 1% in 1993-1998 in the pre-ATZ period),
while the increase in part-time work following enactment of ATZ is larger in both
absolute and percentage terms for males. Annual retirement hazard rates fall by
similar amounts for both genders in the post-ATZ period.
The experience and establishment tenure figures on the table are
understated because they are measured beginning in 1975 for West Germans but
only since 1990-1992 for East Germans. The regressions control for the German

17

state to account for the differences in tenure measures and other state specific
unobservable factors. Average establishment size is smaller among women than
men, possibly leading to more limited partial retirement opportunities.
5. Econometric Results
For brevity and ease of interpretation, we present most key econometric
results graphically. However, Appendix Section A3 provides all information in
the graphs in tabular form, as well as regression coefficients for the
supplementary covariates.
5.1 Part-Time Employment
Figures 3A and 3B plot the marginal effects after Probit estimation of
Equation [1] with the part-time employment dependent variable. The estimates
suggest part-time employment rates rose for both men and women during the
post-ATZ period, but not uniformly. The increases begin at age 55 for males and
slightly earlier for females, and then peak at age 60 or 61 for both. For men, the
estimated increase at age 60 is around 17 percentage points in the 1999-2001
period, versus approximately 10 points for females. As suggested by the
descriptive statistics, estimated changes in part-time employment are generally
smaller for women than men. Prior to age 55, male part-time employment rates
were similar in the pre- and post-ATZ periods – the estimated differences are all
smaller than 0.1 percentage point although, given our large sample sizes, still
statistically significant – implying that there were no important changes in parttime employment patterns among younger men, and that the estimated increases
at age 55 and above are likely attributable to the policy. Conversely, part-time
employment did increase among younger women, raising the possibility that some
of the growth observed after age 55 higher ages might be attributable to secular
trends, rather than the ATZ. This further supports the conclusion that men's parttime employment rates increased more than women's.

18

Among men, there are few significant differences in estimated effects
between 1999-2001, when Block Model arrangements were rare, and 2002-2004
when they were widely available. For women, the results often vary across the
two periods, with the estimated increases in part-time employment generally
being higher in 2002-2004 than 1999-2001, especially at ages 60 and above. So,
although Block Model was more widely available in the second period, we do not
find a dramatic decline in part-time participation.
It is interesting that part-time employment rates do not peak until close to
or even after age 60 for both men and women, given that partial retirees could
retire with full pension benefits at age 60. A potential explanation is that some
individuals may not have begun partial retirement in time to complete the
minimum three year spell by age 60. This could reflect poor planning on their
part. However, an alternative explanation is employer rationing of partial
retirement arrangements, which seems plausible since many collective bargaining
agreements contained explicit caps on partial retirement participation of 3% to 8%
of the workforce (Eurofound 2014).
5.2 Retirement
The ATZ-induced increases in part-time employment identified above
reflect some combination of reductions in full-time work and increases in parttime job-holding among persons who would otherwise have been retired. Here,
we examine the latter, Figures 4A and 4B show the estimated changes in agespecific annual retirement hazard rates and reveal striking differences by gender.
Among men, the estimates imply a discrete drop in retirement likelihood between
age 55 and 59 in both post-policy periods. Although part-time employment rates
remained high after age 60, the retirement hazard rates are not statistically
significantly different from pre-ATZ levels at ages 60 or 61. So, it appears any
delay in retirement attributable to ATZ occurred before age 60. For women, we
find little evidence of a change in retirement behavior prior to age 60 in either

19

post-ATZ period. Interestingly, fewer women retired at age 60 in the post-policy
periods but more retired at age 61.
To more directly assess how ATZ may have changed the expected
duration of working life, Figures 5A and 5B plot the simulated employment
survival rates computed from our hazard rate models using Equation [2]. For the
2002-04 period, when use of the Block Model had become common, we
calculated employment survival in two ways. The first treats participation in
Block Model Release Phase as a continuation of employment, since the individual
formally remained attached to the employer. The second treats these persons as
retired, since they were no longer at work.
The simulations imply men were substantially more likely to be employed
between ages 55 and 59 in both post ATZ periods. When persons in the Block
Model Release Phase are treated as employed, the worklife extensions are
virtually identical in 1999-2001 and 2002-2004. With the Block Model Release
Phase treated as retirement, the probability of continued work is lower in the later
post ATZ period but still remains above baseline levels. The estimated ATZ
effects on employment survival diminish after age 60, as suggested in the hazard
rate analysis, but remain above pre-policy levels through age 65.
The results for women are quite different. In our main estimates, there is
little observed ATZ effect on employment continuation rates in either of the postpolicy periods, except for a modest increase in survival probabilities at age 60 and
61. However, since a substantial number of 55-65 year old women were in Block
Model arrangements in 2002-2004, treating those in the Release Phase as retired
implies lower employment survival rates in these years than before the policy.
To further interpret these patterns, Table 3 reports changes in expected
employment durations implied by the simulated survival rates, computed using
Equations [4] and [7]. Based on these estimates, the expected duration of male
employment was 1.8 years longer in the early years of the policy and 1.9 years

20

longer when Block Model because widely available, treating Release Phase as
continued employment. Also, the amount of time spent in full-time employment
increased by 0.8 years. This last result may have occurred because employers
rationed partial retirement opportunities. Under rationing, some employees might
prefer extend the duration of full-time work, so as to qualify for a partial
retirement arrangement, rather than retiring early and abruptly. When treating
time in the Block Model release phase as being retired, the expected duration of
working life in 2002-2004 is just 1.2 years longer than at baseline and the
duration of full-time work is 0.2 years longer.
Women's employment duration changed less than men – rising 0.3 years
in the low Block Model years and 0.2 years in the high Block Model years,
treating Release Phase participants as employed. However the duration of
employment fell 0.2 years if workers in the Release Phase were counted as retired.
Women were estimated to spend less time in full-time employment in both postperiods. From 1999-2001, the predicted reduction in full-time work was only 0.1
years which, when coupled with a 0.3 year estimated increase in employment
duration, suggests women's total hours of work increased.
To summarize, the ATZ policy appears to have extended the worklives of
men and women and led to a net increase in hours before the Block Model
became popular, though this increase was markedly larger among men than
women. When the Block Model option became available, women used it to stop
working earlier than they otherwise would have, while men continued to work
longer than prior to implementation of the ATZ, but less so than when the Block
Model had been unavailable.
5.3 Robustness Checks
We also tested how the ATZ affected durations of employment and work
using a variety of alternative specifications. The results are summarized in
columns (2) through (6) of Table 3. In column (2) controls for individual wage

21

and occupation were included as supplementary controls. 14 Second, we excluded
the period between the passage of ATZ and effective date (1996 to 1998). Third,
we restricted the analysis to a subset of industries for which we were able to
obtain information about collective bargaining agreements. For this subsample,
we use the dates when partial retirement clauses were introduced to define the pre
and post policy periods. Fourth, we restricted the sample to persons employed
within the establishment since age 50, in order to limit potential selection into (or
out of) establishments. Fifth, we added establishment fixed effects to the baseline
model.
Across these alternative specifications, we consistently find evidence of
longer employment durations among men. In all but one specification (with
controls for wage and occupation included), we also find that ATZ led to a net
increase in male lifetime work hours in both post policy periods. The magnitude
of the estimated durations change substantially when omitting 1996 to 1998 from
the sample or using collective bargaining agreement dates, but all other estimates
of employment duration remain reasonably close to the baseline estimates.
Conversely, the results are much less robust to changes of model specifications
for women, but all of the estimates indicate earlier departures from the labor force
once the Block Model became available.
6. Discussion and Conclusion
This paper investigates whether incentives for partial-retirement
introduced through Germany's federal ATZ policy successfully promoted gradual
transitions to retirement and longer working lives. Among men, our findings
suggest the policy did work as designed. ATZ was associated with substantial
increases in part-time work and reductions in retirement hazard rates that
translated into a 1.8 year extension in the expected duration of employment.
14

These variables were originally excluded from Equation [1] because they might be correlated
with unobserved attributes like productivity or labor force attachment.

22

When the Block Model option, which amounts to a form of early retirement,
became available, the ATZ-induced extension of average male working lives fell
to around 1.2 years because many men remained employed but did not work
during the Block Model Release Phase. Nevertheless, even in this period, our
analysis suggests that the ATZ led to a net increase in lifetime hours of work
among men.
For women, the results are more difficult to interpret. We do find increases
in part-time work among older women but cannot be sure they are attributable to
the ATZ policy, because part-time employment also increased for those too young
to reduce work hours through the program. Overall, we find little change in
women's expected duration of employment, during the early ATZ period, and a
0.2 year reduction in work and a 1.2 year decrease in full-time employment once
the Block Model option became available. The divergent responses to ATZ by
gender may reflect: differences in the initial prevalence of part-time work, in
implementation of the ATZ across male and female dominated industries, and in
pension rules or in preferences.
Introduction of the Block Model option provided a unique opportunity to
assess how responses to partial retirement incentives change when early abrupt
retirement is made available with the same compensation. Among 55-59 year old
men ages, part-time employment rates did not change between the 1999-2001 and
2002-2004 periods. Rates were statistically significantly lower among men aged
60 and 61 in the later time span, but still over 10 percentage points above preATZ levels. Women's rates of part-time employment were higher in 2002-2004
than 1999-2001. Both results suggest that gradual reduction of working time was
still attractive to many older workers even when early retirement through the
Block Model was feasible. This raises the possibility that partial retirement
incentives may be successful in promoting gradual transitions from working life
even in institutional environments with generous early retirement opportunities.

23

Previous studies note the most popular partial retirement policies have
flexibly defined work reduction requirements to allow part-year schedules or in
the extreme, Block Model arrangements (Latulippe and Turner 2000). Our
findings suggest that such flexibility may come at the cost of reduced
effectiveness in promoting longer working lives. The introduction of early
retirement opportunities through the Block Model was associated with earlier
departures from work for males than the policy as originally implemented.
Among women, it was associated with earlier departures than in the pre-policy
period. Nonetheless, employment relationships still lasted longer in the high
Block Model period than in the pre-ATZ period, especially among men.
Although we cannot directly compute the actual net costs of the policy, we
can use the estimates we have produced to estimate that likely net cost or savings
for a representative partial retiree and extrapolate using information from prior
studies. The costs of the policy included subsidies paid, any net loss of tax
revenue from reduced hours work, and the marginal increase in pension benefit
entitlements from postponement of retirement. Using a representative worker with
wage earnings equal to the 2004 national average of €38,100, the total subsidy
paid per year of partial retirement would be €12,908 (Boss and Elendner 2005;
OECD - Social Policy Division 2015). 15 In our data the average duration of
partial retirement was 3 years, which implies the total subsidy cost for a
subsidized arrangement would be €38,724. Prior studies estimate between 10 and
20 percent of ATZ arrangements were subsidized, depending on the year
(Brussig, Knuth, and Wojtkowski 2009). Assuming 20 percent were subsidized,
the expected total subsidy cost per partial retiree would be approximately €7,745.
15
Average earnings figure is from OECD (2004). Subsidies provided 20% of former full-time
earnings and 40% of former pension contributions. 20% of average earnings is €7,620. Assumed
pension contribution rate is 35.7% based on Boss and Elander (2005), so the pension contribution
subsidy amount is €5,288. These figures also correspond with the annual cost per subsidized
participant implied by administrative data from the Federal Employment Agency reported in
Huber, Lechner, and Wunsch (2013).

24

The simulated employment and full-time work durations, from our preferred
specification for the low Block Model period (1999-2001), imply a net gain in
income tax revenue among men of approximately €7,500 per male partial retiree
and €160 per female. 16 Previous studies indicate 56% of partial retirees were
male, so the average gain in tax revenue is approximately €4,270 per partial
retiree (Huber, Lechner, and Wunsch 2013). Using simulated durations from the
high Block Model period (2002-2004), the tax savings falls to an average of €470
per partial retiree. Working longer increases the pension benefit received when
retired, but accrual is 10% lower during partial retirement. In total, the
hypothetical male partial retiree would earn a net increase in annual pension
benefits of approximately €560 associated with 2 years of additional years of
work, which over a 20 year retirement is approximately equivalent to €7,870 in
present value terms. 17 Gains for females are negligible because the estimated
increase in years of work is so small, so the average additional pension costs per
partial retiree are €4,400.
Because ATZ led to a postponement of retirement, it also created savings
to the pension system. During this time period, most early retirees used
unemployment insurance benefits equal to 60% of former net earnings, for up to
960 days, to bridge the period between the end of work and claiming of an Old
Age Pension (“Social Security Programs Throughout the World: Europe, 2004 Germany” 2015). Assuming that unemployment benefits would have otherwise
been claimed, a 1.8 year extension of working life would have saved the
unemployment insurance system approximately €41,150 for the representative
male partial retiree, and a 0.3 year extension saves approximately €6,860 for the
16
Calculations assume €38,100 in annual full-time wage earnings for both men and women, a
marginal income tax rate of 24.5 percent income earned beyond 50 percent of full-time earnings,
and an average annual tax rate of 11 percent when working part-time (Boss and Elandner 2005).
17
Figures are based on the 2004 pension value reported in “Social Security Programs Throughout
the World: Europe, 2004 - Germany” (2015) and assume a worker with an average earnings
history works 2 additional years and receives 90% of full-time benefits.

25

representative female. So the expected savings to the unemployment insurance
system per partial retiree is approximately €26,000 in the low Block Model
period. Using the same calculations with high Block Model period simulated
durations of employment, the savings is €26,300 per partial retiree.
In total, these calculations imply an average net savings per partial retiree
of €18,125 in the low Block Model period and €17,625 in the high Block Model
period. Wanger (2010) reports approximately 500,000 partial retirees in 2004,
which using these calculations imply a total savings of €9.1 billion attributable to
that cohort alone if the policy had continued to operate as it did in the low Block
Model period. Using the high Block Model figures, the estimated savings is €8.8
billion. So, although ATZ may not have achieved the aim of promoting actual
gradual transitions from work as effectively after the Block Model was available,
it likely still created a substantial net savings.
Notably, the savings in unemployment insurance benefits is responsible
for the large estimated gains in both periods. In environments with less generous
unemployment benefits, or where workers were not originally financing early
retirements with public benefits, the savings from partial retirement may be much
smaller or even negative. Also, if all partial retirees had been subsidized the
policy may have led to a net loss. However, the subsidies were contingent upon
the employment of an unemployed worker or trainee to fill the reduced hours, and
our calculations do not account for unemployment benefit savings or additional
tax revenue associated with hiring these workers.
The extensions in employed life attributable to ATZ, among men, appear
large when compared to the corresponding effects from increasing the normal
retirement age, another common policy for extending worklives. For example,
Gustman and Steinmeier (1985) estimate the percentage of the labor force retiring
at age 65 will fall by 6.3 percentage points when the increase in normal U.S.
retirement age from 65 to 67 legislated in 1983 is fully phased in. For comparison,

26

our estimates imply the percentage of men who retired at age 55 fell by 8
percentage points in 1999-2001, and the percentage who retired between ages 55
and 59 fell by 24 percentage points. 18 Among women, however, our estimates
imply that retirement probabilities between 55 and 59 fell by only 3 percentage
points.
Because few employers took advantage of ATZ subsidies it may seem that
the results of the policy could have been achieved without the policy. Yet, finding
ways to manage demographic transition in the workforce that do not violate age
discrimination protection can be difficult for employers. For example, this is the
reason that U.S. employers define eligibility for buyouts based on tenure rather
than age. ATZ offered German employers a way to legally target a specific age
group for transition out of the establishment when pension system reforms had
increased statutory retirement ages and made buyouts or other mechanisms more
expensive.
Our analysis is subject to several limitations. First, although we have
attempted to parse out the effects of pension reforms occurring at the same time as
the ATZ policy, the relationship between these reforms and labor supply could be
complex such that our estimates may misattribute some of the effects of the
pension reforms to ATZ. We believe this is unlikely because we find very small
changes in employment durations among women. Women experienced the same
changes in statutory ages of eligibility for Old Age benefits due to unemployment
and disability as men did and their age of eligibility for regular access to Old Age
benefits increased from 60 to 65 whereas men's remained at 65. Second, as
mentioned, individuals leaving a sampled establishment will generally no longer
be observed in the data, so we are unable to examine retirement transitions that

18

Probabilities computed by multiplying estimated hazard and computed survival rates for each
age. Our simulations imply a 16 percentage point decline in retirement probabilities between ages
55 and 59 and a 20 percentage point decline in 2002-2004.

27

involve job changes. However, we have also provided evidence (the small number
of person-year observations in their first year of employment) that this limitation
is likely to minor. Third, we do not observe exact hours of work, limiting our
ability to quantify changes in hours of labor supplied implied by our analysis. We
also miss partial retirements occurring among those who were already part-time
workers. This may help to explain why we find smaller policy responses in
women's part-time employment rates than men's. Finally, we are unable to link
spouses in the LIAB data and so cannot account for any joint decision-making or
the influence of spousal incentives on retirement decisions. However, since
Germany does not have a spousal entitlement to pension benefits, this limitation
may be less troubling than it would be for analyses of other countries.

Appendix
A1. Changes in Pensionable Ages
In 1992, the German government announced gradual increases in
pensionable age. These changes are outlined in Table A1, with pre-reform
pensionable ages displayed in the first row. Prior to the reforms, German men
could claim full old age pensions at age 60 if they were receiving unemployment
or disability benefits, and many Germans did so because the requirements for
receiving these benefits were minimal. Employers subsidized exits as early as age
56 or 57 through "dismissal contracts" which were essentially buy-out
agreements. Individuals would finance early retirement with a combination of
payments from their employers and disability/unemployment benefits until they
could claim their pensions age 60. Women were eligible for pensions at age 60
even without receiving unemployment or disability benefits.
The first of the 1992 reforms became binding in 1998, but were known to
all cohorts in 1992. As shown in Table A1, these reforms affected cohorts across
all three of our study periods. To control for these changes in the results presented
in Table 2, we created a variable for each pension "pathway" (reduced
unemployment, reduced disability, reduced long service, full men's, full women's,
full unemployment, full disability, and full long service) equal to the age the
cohort could claim benefits as displayed in Table A1.

a

Before the 1993 reforms there was no actuarial adjustment for early receipt of pension benefits. Full benefits

were available at age 60 for reason of unemployment or disability and at age 63 for those with long service
histories (35 years or more).

A2. Collective Agreement Clauses on Partial Retirement
Partial retirement was a major topic of bargaining in many industries in
1998 (Eurofound 2014). In Germany, collective bargaining primarily occurs
regionally and within industries. While it was technically feasible for firms and
individuals to specify partial retirement arrangements, the vast majority of
opportunities were governed by collective bargaining agreements. Table A2
provides the key details of all available collective bargaining agreements reached
from 1996 through 2004. Notably, many agreements contained wage and pension
benefit minimums that exceeded the ATZ floors, and several agreements also
included explicit caps on participation. Also, most of the early adopting industries
were male dominated.
In one of our robustness checks, we use the effective dates from a subset
of collective agreements to define pre and post policy periods. The subset used is

40

reported in Table 1. Bargaining unit designations do not always directly
correspond to industry definitions used in the administrative pension system. This
subset of agreements included only those where we were confident in our ability
to identify the likely group of covered establishments using the industry and
region information available in the LIAB and where the agreement applied to all
employees within the establishment to avoid errors in identifying covered and
excluded employees. The results of this analysis and other robustness checks are
presented in Table 3 as simulated employment and full-time work durations. The
underlying regression results are available upon request.

Notes: Dependent variable is equal to 0 for all persons still employed at all (including Block Model
participants) until the last year of employment when dependent variable equals 1. Last year of employment is
only counted if an end of employment notification is filed. All regressions include year, industry, and German
state dummies. Estimates are means of marginal effects computed after Probit estimation and interpreted as
changes in the retirement (defined as end of the employment relationship) hazard rate. These regressions are
the source of changes in age specific retirement hazard rates plotted in Figures 4A and 4B, too.

Age of eligibility for full benefits from old age pension remained constant at 65 for all men during this time
period. See Appendix Section A1 for detailed explanation of changes in pensionable age that occurred during
study period.

Notes: Rates in 1999-2001 and 2002-2004 are calculated as the sum of baseline rates (1993-1998) computed
from LIAB data and estimated changes in hazard rates associated with ATZ policy. Survival rates computed
from hazard rates for individuals employed at age 50.
