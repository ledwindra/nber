HOW DO FIXED-EXCHANGE-RATES REGIMES WORK:
THE EVIDENCE FROM THE GOLD STANDARD, BRETTON WOODS AND THE EMS

ABSTRACT

This paper defines two competing hypotheses on the working of fixed
exchange rates.

The "symmetry" hypothesis states that every country is

concerned with the good functioning of the system, and cannot afford to
deviate from world averages.

Every country is just left to follow the

rules of the game," that is to avoid sterilizing balance of payments
flows.

The world price level is pegged down either by an external

numeraire like gold, or by cooperation among central banks, in a fiat
currency system.

The competing hypothesis states that fixed-exchange-

rates regimes are inherently asymmetric: they are characterized by a
'center country" which provides the nominal anchor for the others,
either by managing the gold parity in a centralized fashion, or by
arbitrarily setting some other nominal anchor.

I discuss the empirical

evidence to discriminate between the two hypotheses, by studying the
institutional features and the data on three experiences of fixed rates:
the International Gold Standard, the Bretton Woods regime, and the
European Monetary System.

Introduction
Few countries freely float their currencies: the International

Financial Statistics Supplement on Exchange Rates (1985) lists only 12
out of 147 members of the IMF as "independently floating". While this
list includes large countries like the United States, Japan and the
United Kingdom, as many as 34 countries, for example, peg their
currencies to the US dollar.

Even so, in the current open-economy

macroeconomics literature most theoretical and empirical papers deal
with aspects of flexible-exchange-rates regimes.
There exist two competing hypotheses on the working of fixed
exchange rates.

The 'symmetry" hypothesis states that every country is

concerned with the good functioning of the system, and cannot afford to
deviate from world averages.

Every country is just left to follow the

"rules of the game," that is to avoid sterilizing balance of payments
flows.

This hypothesis is masterfully described by McCloskey and Zecher

[1976].
If every country is just concerned with accomodating reserve flows
in order to maintain its exchange-rate parities, however, the
international monetary system as a whole suffers from an indeterminacy:
there is no system-wide nominal anchor.

According to the proponents of

the symmetry hypothesis, this nominal anchor is provided by an external
numeraire like gold, or is agreed upon by member countries through a
process of international cooperation.

Hence Helpman's [1981] labeling

of this regime as a "cooperative peg".
The competing hypothesis states that fixed-exchange-rates regimes

S

With gold as an external numeraire, the gold standard and the
Bretton Woods system provide, in different degrees, an official nominal
anchor for all member countries.

In the EMS, by contrast, this official

nominal anchor is altogether absent.

Each EMS currency, and each

currency in the European Community, has a central rate determined in
terms of the European Currency Unit (ECU), a basket unit of account that
comprises a specified quantity of every currency in the European
Community.

The ratio of any two ECU central rates is used to obtain

bilateral central rates, which are the target rates for monetary
authorities.

Given that the ECU is just a weighted average of the

member countries' currencies, if

n

is the number of currencies in the

ECU, there are only n-i bilateral exchange rates to be pegged: for this
reason a nominal anchor is absent from the rules governing the EMS.3

2.2

Bands
In the gold standard regime, individual currencies' gold parities,

and the costs of shipping gold internationally, jointly implied
bilateral bands within

which exchange rates could fluctuate without

requiring any action by monetary authorities.

Whenever bilateral

Since some currencies like the pound and the drachma are not part of

2.3

Adlustment and Financing
During the gold standard central banks were compelled to take

corrective actions by

a

combination of two mechanisms:

the

convertibility of banknotes into gold coins, which encouraged arbitrage

by the private sector whenever exchange rates exceeded bilateral
fluctuation limits, and the coverage of banknotes by gold, which forced
central banks to maintain

a

certain ratio of gold reserves to

circulating banknotes, thus reacting to fluctuations of their gold
reserve.12

Changes in the discount rate and open market operations

(Bloomfield [1959]) were the standard corrective actions.

Various

central banks also resorted to the so called "manipulation of gold
points" which I discuss below in section 3.
No central-bank financing arrangement was part of the institutional
setup of the gold standard.

However, a number of instances are recorded

when central banks granted bilateral credit to each other.

Ford [1962]

notes that the Bank of France discounted Sterling bills to ease the

As Eichengreen [1985] notes, England, among others, was on a
fiduciary system, requiring full backing of note issue after a
certain limit (the fiduciary issue) was reached. In Germany the Bank
Act required that note circulation could not exceed a limit above
three times the value of gold reserves, and if it did, the Reichsbank
had to pay a 5 percent tax on the excess circulation. See US
National Monetary Commission [1911).

Kindleberger

[1984] describes the cooperation between European central banks in the

crisis of 1890, when the Bank of England asked the Russian State Bank
not to draw on its deposits in London, obtained from the State 3ank a
800,000 sterling gold loan, and from the Bank of France a loan of
3,000,000 sterling in gold.13
The Bretton Woods system and the EMS, by contrast, are
characterized by a complex structure of loans available to finance
balance-of-payments needs.

These financial resources support the

foreign exchange market intervention required to keep currencies within
their fluctuation bands.

Neither the IMF Articles of Agreement, nor the

rules governing the EMS, spell Out the actions that central banks have
to take when exchange rates reach bilateral fluctuation margins.

In

both systems the modality of adjustment to external disequilibria is
only specified through the rules governing the financing of central
banks' external imbalances, though there are some concessions to the
principle of symmetry (in the Bretton Woods regime through the clauses

on 'scarce' currencies, see Argy

[1981],

in the EMS

with

the divergence

indicator, and the Very Short Financing Facility, described below).
Under the Bretton Woods regime member countries could draw on
various tranches of their IMF "quota". These tranches are characterized

by different degrees of "conditionality", that imposes progressively

13

[1959]..

10

tighter constraints on monetary and fiscal policies: resources are made
available to the borrowers subject to their meeting certain prespecified
performance criteria.
The EMS

rules

14

for balance-of-payments financing appear to be

designed to avoid crises: the central banks of the currencies reaching
bilateral intervention margins are supposed to grant each other
automatic credit (not subject to authorization) in unlimited amounts
under the Very Short Term Financing Facility.15

The Very Short Term

Financing Facility can also be used to support foreign exchange market
intervention within the marginal fluctuation bands, subject to the
authorization of the central bank whose currency is being drawn.

The

Short Term Monetary Support, another form a financial assistance
available to EMS central banks experiencing temporary balance-ofpayments difficulties, is instead governed by a "quota" system similar
to that used by the IMF.

14

In the 1960s even the lowest conditionality resources, however, were
not obtainable quickly enough to be usable to fend-off balance-ofpayments crises.

Is Asymmetry Induced by the Institutions?
The very brief survey of institutional features of the three fixed-

exchange-rates regimes suggests two observations.

First, the basic

structure of internationa] monetary systems has not changed dramatically
in the last century.

In particular, despite the efforts of policymakers

to improve upon the IMF Articles of Agreement, the features of the
Bretton Woods system and the EMS are noticeably similar.

(given the minor role played by gold during the Bretton Woods regime),
and by elaborate structures of balance of payments financing
arrangements, which stand in contrast to the absence of any explicit
rules for central banks to follow when bilateral fluctuations margins
are reached.

The added complications of the EMS, regarding the

divergence indicator, have proved impractical.16

In the gold standard,

instead, adjustment rules were provided by the market mechanism, and by
each country's coverage system.
The second observation suggested by my survey is that the rules of
the gold standard, Bretton Woods and the EMS do not seem per se to
induce an asymmetric working of international adjustment.

Except in the

case of Bretton Woods- -where the bilateral fluctuation bands of the
dollar are narrower than those of the other currencies- -none of the
basic institutional features of the three fixed-exchange-rate regimes

14

devices were used by the Bank of France and the Reichsbank (Bloomfield
[1959J),
The use of regulatory controls as emergency measures is common also
in the Bretton Woods and EMS years.

Article VI of the IMF Articles of

Agreement even allows the Fund to request countries with balance of
payments problems to impose capital controls for a limited time, in
order to prevent the use of Fund resources.

In response to capital

account deficits, the Kennedy Administration proposed an investment tax
credit in 1961,

and passed the Interest Equalization Tax in 1963--a tax

on US residents' purchases of foreign securities--followed by the
Foreign Credit Restraint Program and the Foreign Direct Investment
Program--aimed at limiting foreign investments by commercial banks,
other financial institutions, and industrial companies.

French and

Italian authorities tightened various measures to prevent capital
outflows after the Summer of 1968 and the Fall of 1969.
The practice of using capital controls as a fine-tuEiig device to
stem speculative flows has survived im the EMS.

Countries like France

and Italy, which until recently have prohibited the non-firm private
sector to trade on financial assets with the rest of the world, have

used restrictions on international trade credits to slow down or speed
up the response of short term capital flows.19

19

In Giavazzi and Giovannini forthcoming] we show that the tightening
and release of controls on international trade credits by France and
Italy can be explained by the occurence of balance of payments
difficulties, and is used very frequently by central banks. We also

15

Giavazzi and Giovannini [1986] argue that in the EMS countries like
France and Italy crucially rely on capital controls, witness the large
divergences between domestic and offshore interest rates on franc and
lira assets.

They see asyuunetries of capital controls as just a

reflection of the central role played by the Bundesbank, and capital
controls as instrumental for countries other than Germany to maintain
their exchange rate targets in the EMS,

without

completely their monetary sovereignty.

This observation raises two

related questions.

a

There is ample qualitative

evidence and opinion (see, for example, Bloomfield [1959], Ford (1962],
Scanimell

[1965])

that the Bank of England tended to use administrative

devices less frequently than its counterparts in the continent.

It is

well known that the convertibility of banknotes into gold was not
guaranteed by law in France, but was left to the central bank's
discretion.

The much less frequent changes of the discount rate by the

Bank of France, relative to the Bank of England and the Reichsbank,
tends to imply the effectiveness of the threat of inconvertibility,

which was accompanied by numerous changes of the gold points.

In

Germany international shipments of gold were apparently discouraged by
moral suasion.

As Bloomfield [1959] reported, Reichsbsnk officials

questioned at the United States National Monetary Commission denied that
the central bank discouraged commercial banks to obtain gold for export
when the gold export point was reached, but admitted that at certain
times German banks refrained from shipping gold when it was profitable
to do so.

This phenomenon is independently confirmed by Birch [1887]

in his presidential address to the London Institute of Bankers:
"I was raising the question, only a few days since, with some of
the leading bankers in Berlin, whether the Bank of Germany would
give large amounts of gold in exchange for its notes, and rhey
explained to me that, if gold was required to use as currency, they
had no difficulty in getting what they wanted, but that they were
too Patriotic to think of going to the bank for gold with a view to
making a profit on the export." (Birch [1887, p. 510])

The evidence nn asymmetric use of capital controls during the
Bretton Woods years is, to some extent, less clearcut.

While in the

second postwar period as a whole the United States have regulated
international capital flows less than their European counterparts,
episodes like the Interest Equalization Tax were clearly motivated by
the concern of the external influence on domestic monetary management.
The imposition of capital controls was not only resorted to by
deficit countries.

In the months preceding the revaluation of the

Deutsche mark of March 1961, the Bundesbank struggled with capital
inflows by imposing a series of discriminatory measures meant to

17

discourage foreign residents' purchases of German assets,2°

These

measures included higher reserve requirements on foreign owned deposits
at German commercial banks, the prohibition to pay interest on foreign—
owned sight and time deposits, and the prohibition to sell money-market
paper to nonresidents.
In summary, both the evidence on the gold standard and the EMS
suggest that countries other than England (during the gold standard) and
Germany (in the EMS) imposed regulations in order avoid compliance to
the "rules of the game": in an asymmetric system the rules of the game
consist in accomodating fully the center-country's monetary policies.21
Hence these regulations might have been suggesetd by a desire of
maintaining some degree of monetary sovereignty.

The evidence on the

Bretton Woods seems to indicate that capital controls were resorted to
more often outside of the US, although even the US experimented with
them in a number of cases.

Symmetric and Asymmetric Fixed Exchange Rates Regimes: A Definition
The alternative hypotheses about the working of fixed exchange

rates can be illustrated using the canonical model of the gold
standard.22

This model concentrates on the external influences on

domestic monetary policy, and on domestic aggregate variables.

It

relies on the assumption that monetary policy is powerless in affecting
real variables, so that real and nominal variables are determined
independently.

This assumption, which is probably not accurate in

practice, is not essential for the conclusions I will draw here, but is
quite helpful to sharpen the distinction between the alternative
hypotheses on the working of the international monetary system.
There are two countries, a domestic and a foreign country--whose
variables are identified by an asterisk.

The rate of inflation in each

country is determined by the rate of money growth and a velocity shock,
that is independent of monetary factors:

represents the rate of growth of velocity.

version of the model used by Barsky et al. [l988, who analyzed the
international implications of the creation of the Federal Reserve
System.

Hence the rates of inflation at home and abroad

are the same in equilibrium.

Real rates of return on domestic and

foreign securities are equalized except for a variable, x, representing
international portfolio shifts.

In a fiat currency system, d could be interpreted as the change in
domestic credit relative to the initial stock of nominal money.

f is

the outflow of foreign exchange reserves, also measured in terms of the
initial stock of money.

Under the gold standard, d and f are the rate

of growth of the fiduciary issue and the outflow of gold, respectively.
Since there are only two countries in the model, one country's gold

and Hubbard [1987] for a careful evaluation of the law

.

24 It can be shown that in this model a variable real
exchange rate, not
affected by monetary policy, is equivalent to x. Hence x can be
intepreted as a general idiosyncratic shock in goods and assets
markets.

or reserve outflows are the other country's inflows.

Assuming that the

two countries are of equal size, we have:

As equations (6) and (7) show, the world rate of inflation is a weighted
average of the domestic and foreign rates of growth of domestic credit
(adjusted for velocity shocks), while reserve flows are determined by
the deviations of the domestic and foreign monetary policies, and money
demand shocks.

Nominal interest rates are determined by the Fisher

equation:

i=r+p,

i

*

r* +p*

(8)

I define the symmetric fixed-exchange-rateange-rate regime as
follows.

Under a symmetric fixed-exchange-rates regime each central

bank attempts to control a domestic target and a foreign target,
represented by the nominal interest rate, and the rate of change of

21

foreign exchange reserves: the two target variables have the same
weights and desired values in central banks' objectives.

I borrow the

assumption that central bankers' objectives can be described by a
domestic target and a foreign target from Ciovannini [1986), Eichengreen
[1987].,

Giavazzi and Giovannini [forthcoming], and Barsky et al.

[1988).

The specification of the domestic target in terms of the nominal rate of
interest is due to Barro [1988], and Barsky et al. [1988].

(10)

In a commodity-based system like the gold standard, the similarity of
the two objective functions would arise from the common rules on the
convertibility of banknotes into gold coins, and on the similarity of
the rules about specie coverage of banknote circulation.

In a fiat

system like the EMS, the similarity of the two objective functions would
arise as a result of systematic international consultations among member
countries, whose objective is to define common guidelines for monetary
policy.

(12)

International disturbances are equally shared by the two countries, and
international reserve flows are inversely proportional to the importance
of the external target in the two countries' objectives.
By contrast, I define the asymmetric system as follows: the center
country targets the domestic interest rate, while the other country
minimizes the fluctuations of international reserves.

Hence cointries

Equations (13) and (14) show that the center country accomodates world
money demand shocks, but--given the real rate of interest and money
demand- -

it offsets any changes of domestic credit policy in

periphery.

the

The country at the periphery accomodates the center

country's policy, and offsets differences in money demand shocks, which
tend to give rise to international reserve flows.

(16)

Equations (15) and (16) reveal most clearly the fundamental difference
between symmetric and asymmetric fixed-exchange-rates systemstes
systems: in an asymmetric system countries at the periphery give up
control of their domestic target to achieve stability of foreign reserve
flows.

In equilibrium all international portfolio shifts are fully

reflected in changes in the interest rates at the periphery, but do not
change the interest rate in the center country.
The illustration of the symmetric and asymmetric regimes adopted in
this section--based on postulated asymmetries in the objectives of
central bankers--was preferred to an alternative specification, based on
the hypothesis that the center-country is a "Stackelberg leader".

That

model relies on the assumption that changes in monetary policies by
countries other than the leader cannot elicit the leader's reaction.

By

contrast, the model I use has in my opinion the virtue of being based on
a symmetric game structure, but is silent on what gives rise to the
asymmetries in the objective functions.

The asymmetries could be

generated by four different phenomena, which I briefly review below.
They include Mundell's [1968] "proper division of the burden of
international adjustment", the presence of a "reserve currency" country,

24

liquidity constraints affecting differently surplus and deficit
countries, and the issue of "imported reputation".
Robert Mundell [1968J demonstrates that the adjustment to countryspecific disturbances should be divided in inverse proportion to the
sizes of the countries involved.

In our problem, the adjustment to

relative interest-rate shocks is carried out by the small country: the
interest rate in the large country is unaffected.

This result can be

illustrated considering a world made up by two equally-sized regions:
one occupied by a single large country (the "domestic country"), and the
*
other by a large nunber of small countries (denoted by an asterisk, ),

In this world, the rate of inflation is:26

(17)

Each small country's domestic credit policy has a negligible effect on
its own rate of inflation.

By contrast, the small countries' reserve

flows are:

(18)

In equilibrium, deviations of the two target variables from their
desired values are inversely related to the relative effectiveness of
the instrument: hence the small countries end up nearly pegging their
foreign exchange reserves, while the task of pegging the world interest
rate is left to the center country: this corresponds to the the
asymmetric regime postulated above.

A

similar result would obtain if one of the two countries issues a

"reserve" currency: this case is discussed by Swoboda [1978] and Genberg
and Swoboda [1982].

An increase in high-powered money by the reserve-

currency country has a larger effect on world inflation than the same
increase from a non-reserve-currency country.

The foreign exchange

reserves of the other country increase by a multiple of the original
monetary expansion, equal to the money multiplier of the reserve
currency.

Hence the non-reserve-currency central bank would be

relatively ineffective at targeting the rate of interest, and, as above,
would end up targeting foreign exchange reserves.
A third reason for the endogenous establishment of an asymmetric
regime is the presence of constraints on the size of balance-of-payments
deficits, justified, for example, by liquidity constraints.

With

identical objective functions, the equilibrium reserve outflow from the
domestic country is given by equation (12).

If the domestic country

faces systematically positive realizations of x, i.e. it is a "deficit

26

country", and if the Costs of financing reserve outflows are large, the
domestic country would find it advantageous to forego interest rate
stability by accomodating fully the monetary policy of the center
country.
Finally, asymmetric exchange rate regimes could arise in the
"imported credibility" models of Giavazzi and Giovannini [1987] and
Giavazzi and Pagano [1988].

These authors show that, when exchange-rate

targets are fully credible, inflation-prone central banks might find it
advantageous to accomodate fully to a central bank which has an
"inflation fighter" reputation.27

27 As
Giavazzi and Giovannini [forthcoming] stress, however, these
models do not provide a justification as to why the center-country
would prefer such an arrangement over, for example, a flexible
exchange rate regime.

Empirical Evidence
In this section I discuss the empirical evidence on the hypothesis

that the three fixed-exchange-rates regimes worked asymmetrically.

I

first review the evidence on the timing of discount rate changes during
the gold standard.

Then I study the behavior of interest rates in

Woods and
correspondence of parity realignments, both during the Bretton
the EMS.

And finally I derive and test some stochastic implications of

the model of section 4.

5.1

The Timing of Discount-Rate Changes During the Gold Standard
considered
During the gold standard, changes in the bank rate were

the main policy instruments used

by central banks to affect their gold

reserves and international capital flows.
Eichengreen

1987

Bloomfield [1959] and

argue that British rate changes immediately followed

of the
by changes changes in the continent are evidence suggestive
central role of the Bank of England in the gold standard.

To verify

this hypothesis, I have looked at the data published by the US National
Monetary Commission[l9lO],

reporting dates and amounts of discount rate

1989
changes for Britain, France and Germany in the period from January
to December 1907.
First, I have computed the number of occurrences when a change in
the British discount rate was followed (within 1 week) by

a

change in

28

the discount rate in France or Germany.

During that period, the Bank of

England changed the discount rate 104 times, increasing it 59 times, and
decreasing it 45 times.

The Reichsbank followed the increases in the

British discount rate 11 times, and followed the rate decreases 14
times.

There are also 14 cases when the Reichsbank discount rate

changes preceded those of the Bank of England.28

France, by contrast,

followed changes of the bank rate much less frequently (a reflection of
the less intensive use of discount rate policy by the Bank of France).
Only three British rate changes were followed by France within a week (2
negative and 1 positive), while France's discount rate adjustments were
also followed by the Bank of England in three occasions (2 negative
changes 1 positive).

In the case of France, there are also three

correlated with the Bank rate and the French discount rate.°

In

summary, there is very little evidence in support of the hypothesis that
Bank rate changes preceded changes in discount rates in the continent.
As I argue in Giovannini [1986], at least in the monthly data,

there is

a strong contemporaneous correlation between the British and the German
rate.3'

This correlation, however, is almost entirely due to the common

seasonal component in discount rate policies, and therefore cannot be
interpreted as supporting the hypothesis of the leadership of the Bank
32
of England.
How should we interpret these results?

The temporal pattern of

discount-rate changes being tested in this section is consistent with a
leader-follower structure, where the center country's central bank
always moves first, independently of the other central banks' actions,
and taking their reactions into account.

The empirical evidence

these results, by reconstructing Eichengreen's sample. While my

This evidence, however, has

no conclusive implications for the asymmetric model of the gold standard
in section 4.

The Asymmetric Behavior of Interest Rates

A

rather general implication of the model in section 4 regards the

behavior of interest rates.

While in a symmetric regime international

portfolio shifts are reflected in both countries' interest rates, in an
asymmetric regime the center country's rate is unaffected, and
international portfolio disturbances perturb only the other countries'
rates.

35

This result suggests a simple test of the asymmetry hypothesis,

Evidence on the timing structure of discount rates during the EMS is
provided by Roubini [1988]. Using quarterly data, he finds that
lagged values of the German discount rate are correlated with
Italian, Belgian and Danish rates, which he inteprets as evidence of
German leadership. Genberg Saidi and Swoboda [1982] test the
temporal precedence of US monetary policies during the Bretton Woods
years: their evidence does not consistently support the hypothesis
that US monetary policy changes preceded those in the rest of the
world.
The limited use of Granger causality tests is argued in detail by
Cooley and Leroy [1985].
Giavazzi and Giovannini [1987] show that the asymmetric behavior of
interest rates is also an implication of models where prices are
sticky.

31

based on the observation of countries' interest rates in correspondence
of observable international portfolio shifts.

The most natural choice

of episodes of shifts between countries' assets is the periods preceding
devaluations.

Both under the Bretton Woods regime and in the EMS there

have been several realignments of central parities, which have been
prompted by countries' inability to withstand balance-of-payments
difficulties, and have been anticipated--though to different degrees--by
financial markets.

In this section I analyze the behavior of interest

rates around the Bretton Woods realignments of March 1961 (Deutsche mark
revalued), November 196] (devaluation of sterling), August 1969 (French
franc devalued), and October 1969 (Deutsche mark revalued).
Figures 1, 2 and 3 report monthly observations of the 1-month
eurodollar deposit rates, and of the differential between the eurodollar
rate and a domestic money market rate in the US, during an interval of
two years around the realignments of 1961,

Figure 2 shows a large

peak in the Eurodollar interest rate and the offshore-domestic
differential for the dollar in the month of November- - suggesting that
the sterling crisis had some repercussion on the dollar (evidence
against the asymmetry hypothesis).

Figure 5 shows wide swings in the

forward discount on sterling, especially after the date of the
devaluation, and a slight increase in the US TEill rate in the weeks
preceding the devaluation.
Finally, figures 3, 6 and 7 illustrate the data for the August 11,
1969 devaluation of the franc, and the October 24 revaluation of the UN.

33

As figure 3 shows, 1969 is a year of high and volatile Eurodollar
interest rates.

Figure 6 presents the data for the French devaluation.

It shows that the forward market implied a very high differential
between French and US interest rates at the end of June, without any
large swings in the US Thills rate.

The TBill rate, however, falls from

7.4 to 6.05 percent in the week preceding the devaluation.

Figure 7

contrasts the relative stability of the US Thills rate with a sharp
increase of the dollar-DM interest rate differential implied by the
forward premium, which reached 13 percent on September 19.
Figures 8 and 9 report domestic and offshore interest rates for the
lira, the French franc and the Deutsche mark, in the weeks preceding and
immediately following the ENS realignment of April 7, 1986, when both
the lira and the French franc were devalued relative to the Deutsche
mark.

This episode was first studied by Giavazzi and Giovannini [1987].

The sharp movements of dollar rates in correspondence of the

the external target variable.

Under the alternative hypothesis, lagged

realizations of the external target variable- -presumably correlated with
the right-hand side of equation (22)--are correlated with the term on
left-hand side.

Intuitively, in the center country the deviations of

the domestic target from its desired value are white-noise errors.37
In order to derive testable implications, I need identifying

should be uncorrelated with the domestic target.

apparently similar to those performed by Pippenger [1984] and Dutton

These specifications,

are not linked to an underlying optimization problem of central

banks: hence the tests of the significance of individual parameters
proposed by these authors are difficult to interpret.
Tables 3, 4 and 5 report the results of some exploratory tests of
the asymmetry hypothesis.

Table 3 contains the results for the gold

standard data (monthly). I assume that the domestic target variable for
each central bank is an index of coverage of the central bank's
liabilities:

the proportion of the gold reserve to total deposit

liabilities in the Banking Department of the Bank of England, the
proportion of cash to total demand liabilities in the Reichsbank,38 and
the ratio of the gold reserve to circulation in the Bank of France.
addition, I assume that the desired value of the target variable is

notes, divided by the sum of notes in circulation and other demand
liabilities.

constant (plausibly determined by national regulations on coverage, and
banking practice).

For all three countries, I test whether lagged

values of net imports of gold are significantly correlated with the
target variable (in first difference), beyond a set of seasonal
dummies.39

The table shows that the null hypothesis of no correlation

is rejected at the 5 percent level in the case of Germany and France
(the marginal significance level, the probability that the test
statistic exceeds the reported value when the null hypothesis is true,
is actually less than 1 percent in the case of Germany), but it is not
rejected for England.
Table 4 contains the results for the Bretton Woods data
(quarterly).

The domestic target variable is assumed to be the domestic

money-market interest rate, while the foreign target variable is the
change in foreign exchange reserves relative to high-powered money.4°
As before, I include seasonal dummies in the regression.
I find that past balance of payments flows are highly significantly
correlated with the domestic money market rate in the United States and
in the United Kingdom.

This correlation is insignificant in France and

Since the theory does not predict that the disturbances should be

Concluding Observations
The data seems to support the hypothesis of asymmetry

the case of the gold standard and the EMS.

at least in

Although the institutional

setup in both regimes is clearly not inducing asymmetry, there are
striking similarities in the use of capital controls.

Furthermore, the

evidence on interest rate behavior and the statistical tests both
support the asymmetric model,
In

the

case of Bretton Woods, the statistical model rejects the

asymmetry hypothesis, and the evidence on interest rates is--at least in

some cases--not as clearcut as in the case of the

EMS.

In this paper I have followed the strategy of trying to uncover
evidence of asymmetry without exploiting the implications of specific

39

models of asymmetric international monetary systems, like those
mentioned in section 4.

None of the factors giving rise to asymmetries

described above, in my opinion, can alone fully explain all three
historical experiences studied in this paper.

I do believe, though,

that further empirical work should help to identify which of the
alternative models of an asymmetric international monetary system best
fit the individual historical experiences.
