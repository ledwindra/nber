Undergraduate Econometrics Instruction: Through Our Classes, Darkly
Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke
NBER Working Paper No. 23144
February 2017
JEL No. A22
ABSTRACT
The past half-century has seen economic research become increasingly empirical, while the
nature of empirical economic research has also changed. In the 1960s and 1970s, an empirical
economist’s typical mission was to “explain” economic variables like wages or GDP growth.
Applied econometrics has since evolved to prioritize the estimation of specific causal effects and
empirical policy analysis over general models of outcome determination. Yet econometric
instruction remains mostly abstract, focusing on the search for “true models” and technical
concerns associated with classical regression assumptions. Questions of research design and
causality still take a back seat in the classroom, in spite of having risen to the top of the modern
empirical agenda. This essay traces the divergent development of econometric teaching and
empirical practice, arguing for a pedagogical paradigm shift.

As	   the	   Stones’	   Age	   gave	   way	   to	   the	   computer	   age,	   applied	   econometrics	   was	  
mostly	   concerned	   with	   estimating	   the	   parameters	   governing	   broadly	   targeted	  
theoretical	  description	  of	  the	  economy.	  Canonical	  examples	  include	  multi-­‐equation	  
macro	   models	   describing	   economy-­‐wide	   variables	   like	   unemployment	   and	   output,	  
and	   micro	   models	   characterizing	   the	   choices	   of	   individual	   agents	   or	   market	   level	  
equilibria.	  	  The	  empirical	  framework	  of	  the	  sixties	  and	  seventies	  typically	  sought	  to	  
explain	   economic	   outcomes	   with	   the	   aid	   of	   a	   long	   and	   diverse	   list	   of	   explanatory	  
variables,	  but	  no	  single	  variable	  of	  special	  interest.	  	  
Much	  of	  the	  contemporary	  empirical	  agenda	  looks	  to	  answer	  specific	  questions,	  
rather	   than	   provide	   a	   general	   understanding	   of,	   say,	   GDP	   growth.	   This	   agenda	  
targets	   the	   causal	   effects	   of	   a	   single	   factor,	   such	   as	   the	   effects	   of	   immigration	   on	  
wages	   or	   the	   effects	   of	   democracy	   on	   GDP	   growth,	   often	   focusing	   on	   policy	  
questions	  like	  the	  employment	  effects	  of	  subsidies	  for	  small	  business	  or	  the	  effects	  
of	  monetary	  policy.	   Applied	  researchers	  today	  look	  for	  credible	  strategies	  to	  answer	  
such	  questions.	  
Empirical	   economics	   has	   changed	   markedly	   in	   recent	   decades,	   but,	   as	   we	  
document	   below,	   econometric	   instruction	   has	   changed	   little.	   Market-­‐leading	  
econometrics	  texts	  still	  focus	  on	  assumptions	  and	  concerns	  motivated	  by	  a	  model-­‐
driven	  approach	  to	  regression,	  aimed	  to	  help	  students	  produce	  a	  statistically	  precise	  
account	   of	   the	   processes	   generating	   economic	   outcomes.	   Much	   of	   this	   material	  
prioritizes	   technical	   concerns	   over	   conceptual	   matters.	   We	   still	   see,	   for	   example,	  
extended	   textbook	   discussions	   of	   functional	   form,	   whether	   error	   terms	   are	  
independent	   and	   identically	   distributed,	   and	   how	   to	   correct	   for	   serial	   correlation	  
and	   heteroskedasticity.	   Yet	   this	   instructional	   edifice	   is	   not	   of	   primary	   importance	  
for	  the	  modern	  empirical	  agenda.	  At	  the	  same	  time,	  newer	  and	  widely-­‐used	  tools	  for	  
causal	   analysis,	   like	   differences-­‐in-­‐differences	   and	   regression	   discontinuity	  
methods,	  get	  cursory	  textbook	  treatment	  if	  they’re	  mentioned	  at	  all.	  	  
How	   should	   changes	   in	   our	   use	   of	   econometrics	   change	   the	   way	   we	   teach	  
econometrics?	  	  
Our	   take	   on	   this	   is	   simple.	   	   We	   start	   with	   empirical	   strategies	   based	   on	  
randomized	  trials	  and	  quasi-­‐experimental	  methods	  because	  they	  provide	  a	  template	  
that	   reveals	   the	   challenges	   of	   causal	   inference,	   and	   the	   manner	   in	   which	  
econometric	  tools	  meet	  these	  challenges.	  	  We	  call	  this	  framework	  the	  design-­‐based	  
approach	   to	   econometrics	   because	   the	   skills	   and	   strategies	   required	   to	   use	   it	  
successfully	   are	   related	   to	   research	   design.	   	   This	   viewpoint	   leads	   to	   our	   first	  
concrete	  prescription	  for	  instructional	  change:	  a	  revision	  in	  the	  manner	  in	  which	  we	  
teach	  regression.	  	  	  
Regression	   should	   be	   taught	   the	   way	   it’s	   now	   most	   often	   used:	   as	   a	   tool	   to	  
control	  for	  confounding	  factors.	  This	  approach	  abandons	  the	  traditional	  regression	  
framework	  in	  which	  all	  regressors	  are	  treated	  equally.	  The	  pedagogical	  emphasis	  on	  
statistical	  efficiency	  and	  functional	  form,	  along	  with	  the	  sophomoric	  narrative	  that	  
sets	   students	   off	   in	   pursuit	   of	   “true	   models”	   as	   defined	   by	   a	   seemingly	   precise	  
statistical	   fit,	   is	   ready	   for	   retirement.	   	   Instead,	   the	   focus	   should	   be	   on	   the	   set	   of	  
control	   variables	   needed	   to	   insure	   that	   the	   regression-­‐estimated	   effect	   of	   the	  
variable	  of	  interest	  has	  a	  causal	  interpretation.	  

In	  addition	  to	  a	  radical	  revision	  of	  regression	  pedagogy,	  the	  exponential	  growth	  
in	  economists’	  use	  of	  quasi-­‐experimental	  methods	  and	  randomized	  trials	  in	  pursuit	  
of	   causal	   effects	   should	   move	   these	   tools	   to	   center	   stage	   in	   the	   classroom.	   The	  
design-­‐based	   approach	   emphasizes	   single-­‐equation	   instrumental	   variables	  
estimators,	   regression-­‐discontinuity	   methods,	   and	   variations	   on	   differences-­‐in-­‐
differences	  strategies,	  while	  focusing	  on	  specific	  threats	  to	  a	  causal	  interpretation	  of	  
the	  estimates	  generated	  by	  these	  fundamental	  tools.	  	  
Finally,	  real	  empirical	  work	  plays	  a	  central	  role	  in	  our	  classes.	  	  Econometrics	  is	  
better	  taught	  by	  example	  than	  abstraction.	  
Causal	  questions	  and	  research	  design	  are	  not	  the	  only	  sort	  of	  econometric	  work	  
that	  remains	  relevant.	  	  But	  our	  experience	  as	  teachers	  and	  researchers	  leads	  us	  to	  
emphasize	  these	  skills	  in	  the	  classroom.	  	  For	  one	  thing,	  such	  skills	  are	  now	  much	  in	  
demand:	   Google	   and	   Netflix	   post	   positions	   flagged	   by	   keywords	   like	   causal	  
inference,	   experimental	   design,	   and	   advertising	   effectiveness;	   Facebook’s	   data	  
science	  team	  focuses	  on	  randomized	  controlled	  trials	  and	  causal	  inference;	  Amazon	  
offers	  prospective	  employees	  a	  reduced	  form/causal/program	  evaluation	  track.1	  	  
Of	   course,	   there’s	   econometrics	   to	   be	   done	   beyond	   the	   applied	   micro	  
applications	   of	   interest	   to	   Silicon	   Valley	   and	   the	   empirical	   labor	   economics	   with	  
which	  we’re	  personally	  most	  engaged.	  	  But	  the	  tools	  we	  favor	  are	  foundational	  for	  
almost	  any	  empirical	  agenda.	  Professional	  discussions	  of	  signal	  economic	  events	  like	  
the	   great	   recession	   and	   important	   telecommunications	   mergers	   are	   almost	   always	  
arguments	   over	   causal	   effects.	   	   Likewise,	   Janet	   Yellen	   and	   the	   hundreds	   of	  
researchers	  who	  support	  her	  at	  the	  Fed	  crave	  reliable	  evidence	  on	  whether	  X	  causes	  
Y.	  Purely	  descriptive	  research	  remains	  important,	  and	  there’s	  a	  role	  for	  data-­‐driven	  
forecasting.	   Applied	   econometricians	   have	   long	   been	   engaged	   in	   these	   areas,	   but	  
these	   valuable	   skills	   are	   the	   bread	   and	   butter	   of	   disciplines	   like	   statistics	   and,	   in	   the	  
case	   of	   prediction,	   computer	   science.	   	   These	   endeavors	   are	   not	   where	   our	  
comparative	   advantage	   lies.	   	   Econometrics	   at	   its	   best	   is	   distinguished	   from	   other	  
data	   sciences	   by	   clear	   causal	   thinking.	   	   This	   sort	   of	   thinking	   is	   therefore	   what	   we	  
emphasize	  in	  our	  classes.	  
Following	   a	   brief	   description	   of	   the	   shift	   toward	   design-­‐based	   empirical	   work,	  
we	  flesh	  out	  the	  argument	  for	  change	  by	  considering	  the	  foundations	  of	  econometric	  
instruction,	   focusing	   on	   old	   and	   new	   approaches	   to	   regression.	   We	   then	   look	   at	   a	  
collection	   of	   classic	   and	   contemporary	   textbooks,	   and	   a	   sample	   of	   contemporary	  
reading	   lists	   and	   course	   outlines.	   Reading	   lists	   in	   our	   sample	   are	   more	   likely	   to	  
cover	  modern	  empirical	  methods	  than	  are	  today’s	  market-­‐leading	  books.	  But	  most	  
courses	  remain	  bogged	  down	  in	  boring	  and	  obsolete	  technical	  material.	  	  
	  
	  
Good	  Times,	  Bad	  Times	  
	  
The	  exponential	  growth	  in	  economists’	  use	  of	  quasi-­‐experimental	  methods	  and	  
randomized	   trials	   is	   documented	   in	   Panhans	   and	   Singleton	  (2016).	   Angrist	   and	  
Krueger	  (1999)	   described	   an	   earlier	   empirical	   trend	   for	   labor	   economics,	   but	   this	  
trend	   is	   now	   seen	   in	   applied	   microeconomic	   fields	   more	   broadly.	   In	   an	   essay	   on	  

2

changing	   empirical	   work	   (Angrist	   and	   Pischke,	  2010),	   we	   complained	   about	   the	  
modern	  macro	  research	  agenda,	  so	  we’re	  happy	  to	  see	  recent	  design-­‐based	  inroads	  
even	   in	   empirical	   macroeconomics	   (described	   in	   Fuchs-­‐Schuendeln	   and	  
Hassan,	  2016).	  Bowen,	  Frésard,	  and	  Taillard	  (forthcoming)	  report	  on	  the	  accelerating	  
adoption	  of	  quasi-­‐experimental	  methods	  in	  empirical	  corporate	  finance.	  	  
Design-­‐based	  empirical	  analysis	  naturally	  focuses	  the	  analyst’s	  attention	  on	  the	  
econometric	  tools	  featured	  in	  this	  work.	  A	  less	  obvious	  intellectual	  consequence	  of	  
the	   shift	   towards	   design-­‐driven	   research	   is	   a	   change	   in	   the	   way	   we	   use	   our	   linear	  
regression	  workhorse.	  	  
	  
Yesterday’s	  Papers	  (and	  Today’s)	  
The	  changed	  interpretation	  of	  regression	  estimates	  is	  exemplified	  in	  the	  contrast	  
between	  two	  studies	  of	  education	  production,	  Summers	  and	  Wolfe	  (1977)	  and	  Dale	  
and	   Krueger	  (2002).	   Both	   papers	   are	   concerned	   with	   the	   role	   of	   schools	   in	  
generating	  human	  capital:	  Summers	  and	  Wolfe	  with	  the	  effects	  of	  elementary	  school	  
characteristics	   on	  student	   achievement;	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	   with	   the	   effects	   of	   college	  
characteristics	   on	   post-­‐graduates’	   earnings.	   These	   questions	   are	   similar	   in	   nature,	  
but	  the	  analysis	  in	  the	  two	  papers	  differs	  sharply.	  	  
Summers	   and	   Wolfe	  (1977)	   interpret	   their	   mission	   to	   be	   one	   of	   modeling	   the	  
complex	   process	   that	   generates	   student	   achievement.	   They	   begin	   with	   a	   general	  
model	   of	   education	   production	   that	   includes	   unspecified	   student	   characteristics,	  
teacher	   characteristics,	   school	   inputs,	   and	   peer	   composition.	   The	   model	   is	   loosely	  
motivated	  by	  an	  appeal	  to	  the	  theory	  of	  human	  capital,	  but	  the	  authors	  acknowledge	  
that	  the	  specifics	  of	  how	  achievement	  is	  produced	  remain	  mysterious.	  What	  stands	  
out	  in	  this	  framework	  is	  lack	  of	  specificity:	  the	  Summers	  and	  Wolfe	  regression	  puts	  
the	  change	  in	  test	  scores	  from	  3rd	  to	  6th	  grade	  on	  the	  left	  hand	  side,	  with	  a	  list	  of	  29	  
student	   and	   school	   characteristics	   on	   the	   right.	   This	   list	   includes	   family	   income,	  
student	   IQ,	   sex,	   and	   race;	   the	   quality	   of	   the	   college	   attended	   by	   the	   teacher	   and	  
teacher	   experience;	   class	   size	   and	   school	   enrollment;	   and	   measures	   of	   peer	  
composition	  and	  behavior.	  	  
The	  Summers	  and	  Wolfe	  paper	  is	  true	  to	  the	  1970s	  empirical	  mission,	  the	  search	  
for	  a	  true	  model	  with	  a	  large	  number	  of	  explanatory	  variables:	  	  
	  
We	   are	   confident	   that	   the	   coefficients	   describe	   in	   a	   reasonable	   way	   the	  
relationship	   between	   achieving	   and	   GSES	   [genetic	   endowment	   and	  
socioeconomic	   status],	   TQ	   [teacher	   quality],	   SQ	   [non-­‐teacher	   school	   quality],	  
and	  PG	  [peer	  group	  characteristics],	  for	  this	  collection	  of	  627	  elementary	  school	  
students.	  
	  
In	   the	   spirit	   of	   the	   wide-­‐ranging	   regression	   analyses	   of	   their	   times,	   Summers	   and	  
Wolfe	   offer	   no	   pride	   of	   place	   to	   any	   particular	   set	   of	   variables.	   At	   the	   same	   time,	  
their	   narrative	   interprets	   regression	   estimates	   as	   capturing	   causal	   effects.	   They	  
draw	   policy	   conclusions	   from	   empirical	   results,	   suggesting,	   for	   example,	   that	  
schools	  not	  use	  the	  National	  Teacher	  Exam	  Score	  to	  guide	  hiring	  decisions.

This	   interpretation	   of	   regression	   is	   in	   the	   spirit	   of	   Stones’	   Age	   econometrics,	  
which	   typically	   begins	   with	   a	   linear	   regression	   equation	   meant	   to	   describe	   an	  
economic	   process,	   what	   some	   would	   call	   a	   “structural	   relation.”	   	   Many	   authors	   of	  
this	   Age	   go	   on	   to	   say	   that	   in	   order	   to	   obtain	   unbiased	   or	   consistent	   estimates,	   the	  
analyst	   must	   assume	   that	   regression	   errors	   are	   mean-­‐independent	   of	   regressors.	  
But	  since	  all	  regressions	  produce	  a	  residual	  with	  this	  orthogonality	  property,	  for	  any	  
regressor	   included	   on	   the	   right	   hand	   side,	   it’s	   hard	   to	   see	   how	   this	   statement	  
promotes	  clear	  thinking	  about	  causal	  effects.	  
The	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	  (2002)	   investigation	   likewise	   begins	   with	   a	   question	  
about	   schools,	   asking	   whether	   students	   who	   attend	   a	   more	   selective	   college	   earn	  
more	  as	  a	  result,	  and,	  like	  Summers	  and	  Wolfe	  (1977),	  uses	  OLS	  regression	  methods	  
to	  construct	  an	  answer.	  Yet	  the	  analysis	  here	  differs	  in	  three	  important	  ways.	  	  The	  
first	   is	   a	   focus	   on	   specific	   causal	   effects:	   there’s	   no	   effort	   to	   “explain	   wages.”	   The	  
Dale	   and	   Krueger	   study	   compares	   students	   who	   attend	   more	   and	   less	   selective	  
colleges.	  College	  quality	  (measured	  by	  schools’	  average	  SAT	  score)	  is	  but	  one	  factor	  
that	  might	  change	  wages,	  surely	  minor	  in	  an	  R2	  sense.	  	  This	  highly-­‐focused	  inquiry	  is	  
justified	   by	   the	   fact	   that	   it	   aspires	   to	   answer	   a	   causal	   question	   of	   concern	   to	  
students,	  parents,	  and	  policy-­‐makers.	  
The	   second	   distinguishing	   feature	   is	   a	   research	   strategy	   meant	   to	   eliminate	  
selection	  bias:	  Graduates	  of	  elite	  schools	  undoubtedly	  earn	  more	  (on	  average)	  than	  
those	   who	   went	   elsewhere.	   Given	   that	   elite	   schools	   select	   their	   students	   carefully,	  
however,	   it’s	   clear	   that	   this	   difference	   may	   reflect	   selection	   bias.	   The	   Dale	   and	  
Krueger	   paper	   outlines	   a	   selection-­‐on-­‐observables	   research	   strategy	   meant	   to	  
overcome	  this	  central	  problem.	  	  
The	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	   research	   design	   compares	   individuals	   who	   sent	  
applications	  to	  the	  same	  set	  of	  colleges	  and	  received	  the	  same	  admission	  decisions.	  
Within	   groups	   defined	   by	   application	   and	   admission	   decisions,	   students	   who	   attend	  
different	   sorts	   of	   schools	   are	   far	   more	   similar	   than	   they	   would	   be	   in	   an	   unrestricted	  
sample.	   The	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	   study	   argues	   that	   any	   remaining	   within-­‐group	  
variation	  in	  the	  selectivity	  of	  the	  school	  attended	  is	  essentially	  serendipitous	  —	  as	  
good	  as	  randomly	  assigned	  —	  and	  therefore	  unrelated	  to	  ability,	  motivation,	  family	  
background,	   and	   other	   factors	   related	   to	   intrinsic	   earnings	   potential.	   This	   argument	  
constitutes	  the	  most	  important	  econometric	  content	  of	  the	  Dale	  and	  Krueger	  paper.	  	  
The	   third	   difference	   of	   the	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	   study	   is	   a	   clear	   distinction	   between	  
causes	   and	   controls	   on	   the	   right	   hand	   side	   of	   the	   regression.	   	   In	   the	   modern	  
paradigm,	  regressors	  are	  not	  all	  created	  equal.	  	  Rather,	  only	  one	  variable	  at	  a	  time	  is	  
seen	   as	   having	   causal	   effects.	   All	   others	   are	   controls	   included	   in	   service	   of	   this	  
focused	  causal	  agenda.2	  	  	  
In	   education	   production,	   for	   example,	   coefficients	   on	   demographic	   variables	   and	  
other	   student	   characteristics	   are	   unlikely	   to	   have	   a	   clear	   economic	   interpretation.	  
What	   should	   we	   make	   of	   the	   coefficient	   on	   IQ	   in	   the	   Summers-­‐Wolfe	   regression?	  
This	   coefficient	   reveals	   only	   that	   two	   measures	   of	   intellectual	   ability,	   IQ	   and	   the	  
dependent	   variable,	   are	   positively	   correlated	   after	   regression-­‐adjusting	   for	   other	  
factors.	  On	  the	  other	  hand,	  features	  of	  the	  school	  environment,	  like	  class	  sizes,	  can	  
sometimes	  be	  changed	  by	  school	  administrators.	  	  We	  might	  indeed	  want	  to	  consider	  
the	  implications	  of	  class	  size	  coefficients	  for	  education	  policy.

The	  modern	  distinction	  between	  causal	  and	  control	  variables	  on	  the	  right	  hand	  
side	  of	  a	  regression	  equation	  requires	  more	  nuanced	  assumptions	  than	  the	  blanket	  
statement	   of	   regressor-­‐error	   orthogonality	   that’s	   emblematic	   of	   the	   traditional	  
presentation	   of	   regression.	   	   This	   difference	   in	   roles	   between	   right-­‐hand	   variable	  
that	   might	   be	   causal	   and	   those	   that	   are	   just	   controls	   should	   emerge	   clearly	   in	   the	  
regression	  stories	  we	  tell	  our	  students.	  	  
	  
Out	  of	  Control	  
The	   modern	   econometric	   paradigm	   exemplified	   by	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	  (2002)	  
treats	  regression	  as	  an	  empirical	  control	  strategy	  designed	  to	  capture	  causal	  effects.	  
Specifically,	   regression	   is	   an	   automated	   matchmaker	   that	   produces	   within-­‐group	  
comparisons:	   there’s	   a	   single	   causal	   variable	   of	   interest,	   while	   other	   regressors	  
measure	   conditions	   and	   circumstances	   that	   we	   would	   like	   to	   hold	   fixed	   when	  
studying	  the	  effects	  of	  this	  cause.	  By	  holding	  the	  control	  variables	  fixed—that	  is,	  by	  
including	   them	   in	   a	   multivariate	   regression	   model,	   we	   hope	   to	   give	   the	   regression	  
coefficient	   on	   the	   causal	   variable	   a	   ceteris	  paribus,	   apples-­‐to-­‐apples	   interpretation.	  
We	   tell	   this	   story	   to	   undergraduates	   without	   elaborate	   mathematics,	   but	   the	   ideas	  
are	   subtle	   and	   our	   students	   find	   them	   challenging.	   Detailed	   empirical	   examples	  
showing	  how	  regression	  can	  be	  used	  to	  generate	  interesting,	  useful,	  and	  surprising	  
causal	  conclusions	  help	  make	  these	  ideas	  clear.	  	  
Our	   instructional	   version	   of	   the	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	   (2002)	   application	   asks	  
whether	   it	   pays	   to	   attend	   a	   private	   university,	   Duke,	   say,	   instead	   of	   a	   state	   school	  
like	  the	  University	  of	  North	  Carolina.	  This	  converts	  college	  selectivity	  into	  a	  simpler,	  
binary	  treatment,	  so	  that	  we	  can	  cast	  the	  effects	  of	  interest	  as	  generated	  by	  simple	  
on/off	  comparisons.	  Specifically,	  we	  ask	  whether	  the	  money	  spent	  on	  private	  college	  
tuition	  is	  justified	  by	  future	  earnings	  gains.	  This	  leads	  to	  the	  question	  of	  how	  to	  use	  
regression	  to	  estimate	  the	  causal	  effect	  of	  private	  college	  attendance	  on	  earnings.	  	  
For	   starters,	   we	   use	   notation	   that	   distinguishes	   between	   cause	   and	   control.	   In	  
this	   case,	   the	   causal	   regressor	   is	  𝑃! ,	   a	   dummy	   variable	   that	   indicates	   attendance	   at	   a	  
private	   college	   for	   individual	  𝑖 .	   Control	   variables	   are	   denoted	   by  𝑋! ,	   or	   given	   other	  
names	   when	   specific	   controls	   are	   noteworthy,	   but	   in	   all	   cases	   distinct	   from	   the	  
privileged	   causal	   variable,	  𝑃! .	   The	   outcome	   of	   interest,	  𝑌! ,	   is	   a	   measure	   of	   earnings	  
roughly	  20	  years	  post-­‐enrollment.	  	  
The	   causal	   relationship	   between	   private	   college	   attendance	   and	   earnings	   is	  
described	  in	  terms	  of	  potential	  outcomes:	  𝑌!! 	  represents	  the	  earnings	  of	  individual	  𝑖 	  
were	   he	   or	   she	   to	   go	   private	   (𝑃! = 1),	   and	  𝑌!! 	  represents	  𝑖′s	  earnings	   after	   a	   public	  
education	   (𝑃! = 0).	   The	   causal	   effect	   of	   attending	   a	   private	   college	   for	   individual	  𝑖 	  is	  
the	   difference,	  𝑌!! − 𝑌!! .	   This	   difference	   can	   never	   be	   seen;	   rather,	   we	   see	   only	  𝑌!! 	  or	  
𝑌!! ,	   depending	   on	   the	   value	   of  𝑃! .	   The	   analyst’s	   goal	   is	   therefore	   to	   measure	   an	  
average	  causal	  effect,	  like	  E(𝑌!! − 𝑌!! ).	  	  
At	   MIT	   (where	   we	   have	   both	   taught),	   we	   ask	   our	   private-­‐college	   econometrics	  
students	  to	  consider	  their	  personal	  counterfactual	  𝑌!! 	  had	  they	  made	  a	  public-­‐school	  
choice	  instead	  of	  coming	  to	  MIT.	  Some	  of	  our	  students	  are	  seniors	  who	  have	  lined	  up	  
jobs	   with	   the	   likes	   of	   Google	   and	   Goldman.	   Many	   of	   the	   people	   they	   work	   with	   at	  
these	  firms	  —perhaps	  the	  majority	  —	  will	  have	  gone	  to	  state	  schools.	  	  In	  view	  of	  this	  

5

fact,	  we	  ask	  our	  students	  to	  consider	  whether	  MIT-­‐style	  private	  colleges	  really	  make	  
a	  difference	  when	  it	  comes	  to	  career	  success.	  
The	  first	  contribution	  of	  a	  causal	  framework	  based	  on	  potential	  outcomes	  is	  to	  
explain	  why	  naive	  comparisons	  of	  public	  and	  private	  college	  graduates	  are	  likely	  to	  
be	   misleading.	   The	   second	   is	   to	   explain	   how	   an	   appropriately	   constructed	  
regression	  strategy	  leads	  us	  to	  something	  better.	  	  
Naïve	   comparisons	   between	   private	   and	   public	   alumni	   confound	   the	   average	  
causal	   effect	   of	   private	   attendance	   with	   selection	   bias.	   The	   selection	   bias	   here	  
reflects	   the	   fact	   that	   students	   who	   go	   to	   private	   colleges	   are,	   on	   average,	   from	  
stronger	   family	   backgrounds	   and	   probably	   more	   motivated	   and	   better	   prepared	   for	  
college.	  These	  characteristics	  are	  reflected	  in	  their	  potential	  earnings,	  that	  is,	  in	  how	  
much	  they	  could	  earn	  without	  the	  benefit	  of	  a	  private	  college	  degree.	  If	  those	  who	  
end	  up	  attending	  private	  schools	  had	  instead	  attended	  public	  schools,	  they	  probably	  
would	   have	   had	   higher	   incomes	   anyway.	   	   This	   reflects	   the	   fact	   that	   public	   and	  
private	  students	  have	  different  𝑌!! ’s,	  on	  average.	  	  	  
To	   us,	   the	   most	   natural	   and	   useful	   presentation	   of	   regression	   is	   as	   a	   model	   of	  
potential	  outcomes.	  	  Write	  potential	  earnings	  in	  the	  public	  college	  scenario	  as	  𝑌!! =	  
𝛼 + 𝜂! ,	   where	  𝛼 	  is	   the	   mean	   of	  𝑌!! 	  and	  𝜂! 	  is	   the	   difference	   between	   this	   potential	  
outcome	  and	  its	  mean.	  	  Suppose	  further	  that	  the	  difference	  in	  potential	  outcomes	  is	  
a	   constant,	  𝛽,	   so	   we	   can	   write	  𝛽 = 𝑌!! − 𝑌!! .	   	   Putting	   the	   pieces	   together	   gives	   a	  
causal	  model	  for	  observed	  earnings	  
	  	  
𝑌! = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑃! + 𝜂! .	  
	  
	  
Selection	   bias	   amounts	   to	   the	   statement	   that	  𝑌!! 	  (potential	   earnings	   after	   public	  
college	  attendance)	  and	  hence	  𝜂! 	  depends	  (in	  a	  statistical	  sense)	  on	  𝑃! .	  	  
The	  road	  to	  a	  regression-­‐based	  solution	  to	  the	  problem	  of	  selection	  bias	  begins	  
with	   the	   claim	   that	   the	   analyst	   has	   information	   that	   can	   be	   used	   to	   eliminate	  
selection	   bias,	   that	   is,	   to	   purge	   𝑌!! 	  of	   it’s	   correlation	   with	   𝑃! .	   In	   particular,	   the	  
regression	   matchmaker	   postulates	   a	   control	   variable	   𝑋! 	  (or	   perhaps	   a	   set	   of	  
controls).	   Conditional	   on	   this	   control	   variable,	   the	   private	   and	   public	   earnings	  
comparison	  is	  apples-­‐to-­‐apples,	  at	  least	  on	  average,	  so	  those	  being	  compared	  have	  
the	   same	   average	  𝑌!! ’s	   or	  𝜂! ’s.	   	   	   This	   ceteris	   paribus-­‐type	   claim	   is	   embodied	   in	   the	  
conditional	   independence	   assumption	   that	   ultimately	   gives	   regression	   estimates	   a	  
causal	  interpretation:	  	  
	  
𝐸 𝜂! 𝑃! , 𝑋! = 𝐸 𝜂! 𝑋! .  	  
	  
	  
Notice	   that	   this	   is	   a	   weaker	   and	   more	   focused	   assumption	   than	   the	   traditional	  
presentation,	  which	  says	  that	  the	  error	  term	  is	  mean-­‐independent	  of	  all	  regressors,	  
that	  is	  𝐸 𝜂! 𝑃! , 𝑋! = 0.	  	  	  
In	   the	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	   study,	   the	   variable	  𝑋! 	  identifies	   the	   schools	   to	   which	   the	  
college	   graduates	   in	   the	   sample	   had	   applied	   and	   were	   admitted.	   The	   conditional	  
independence	   assumptions	   says	   that,	   having	   applied	   to	   Duke	   and	   UNC	   and	   having	  
been	   admitted	   to	   both,	   those	   who	   chose	   to	   attend	   Duke	   have	   the	   same	   earnings	  

6

potential	  as	  those	  who	  went	  to	  the	  state	  school.	  Although	  such	  conditioning	  does	  not	  
turn	  college	  attendance	  into	  a	  randomized	  trial,	  it	  provides	  a	  compelling	  source	  of	  
control	  for	  the	  major	  forces	  confounding	  causal	  inference.	  	  Students	  pick	  schools	  in	  
view	  of	  their	  ambition	  and	  willingness	  to	  do	  the	  required	  work;	  admissions	  offices	  
look	  carefully	  at	  ability.	  
We	  close	  the	  loop	  linking	  causal	  inference	  with	  linear	  regression	  by	  introducing	  
a	   functional	   form	   hypothesis,	   specifically	   that	   the	   conditional	   mean	   of	   potential	  
earnings	   when	   attending	   a	   public	   school	   is	   a	   linear	   function	   of	  𝑋! .	   This	   can	   be	  
written	  formally	  as	  𝐸 𝜂! 𝑋! =   𝛾𝑋! .	  Econometrics	  texts	  fret	  at	  length	  about	  linearity	  
and	   its	   limitations,	   but	   we	   see	   such	   hand-­‐wringing	   as	   misplaced.	   In	   the	   Dale	   and	  
Krueger	   research	   design,	   the	   controls	   are	   a	   large	   set	   of	   dummies	   for	   all	   possible	  
applicant	   groups.	   	   The	   key	   controls	   in	   this	   case	   come	   in	   the	   form	   of	   a	   saturated	  
model,	   that	   is	   an	   exhaustive	   set	   of	   dummies	   for	   all	   possible	   values	   of	   the	  
conditioning	   variable.	   	   Such	   models	   are	   inherently	   linear.	   	   In	   other	   cases,	   we	   can	  
come	   as	   close	   as	   we	   like	   to	   the	   underlying	   conditional	   mean	   function	   by	   adding	  
polynomial	   terms	   and	   interactions.	   When	   samples	   are	   small,	   we	   happily	   use	  
linearity	  to	  interpolate,	   using	   the	   data	   we	   have	   more	   efficiently.	   In	   some	   of	   the	   Dale	  
and	  Krueger	  models,	  for	  example,	  dummies	  for	  groups	  of	  schools	  are	  replaced	  by	  a	  
linear	  control	  for	  selectivity,	  that	  is,	  the	  average	  SAT	  scores	  of	  their	  students.	  
Combining	   these	   three	   ingredients,	   constant	   causal	   effects,	   conditional	  
independence,	   and	   a	   linear	   model	   for	   potential	   outcomes	   conditional	   on	   controls,	  
produces	  the	  regression	  model	  
	  
𝑌! = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑃! + 𝛾𝑋! + 𝑒! ,	  
	  
	  
which	   can	   be	   used	   to	   construct	   unbiased	   and	   consistent	   estimates	   of	   the	   causal	  
effect	   of	   private	   school	   attendance,	   𝛽.	   The	   causal	   story	   that	   brings	   us	   to	   this	   point	  
reveals	  what	  we	  mean	  by	  𝛽 	  and	  why	  we’re	  using	  regression	  to	  estimate	  it.	  	  
This	   final	   equation	   looks	   like	   many	   seen	   in	   market-­‐leading	   texts.	   But	   the	  
apparent	   similarity	   here	   is	   misleading.	   In	   our	   experience,	   simply	   reciting	  
assumptions	   about	   the	   correlation	   of	   regressors	   and	  𝑒! 	  clouds	   more	   than	   clarifies	  
the	  basis	  for	  causal	  inference.	  	  As	  far	  as	  the	  control	  variables	  go,	  regressor-­‐residual	  
orthogonality	  is	  assured	  rather	  than	  assumed;	  that	  is,	  regression	  algebra	  assuredly	  
makes	   this	   happen.	   At	   the	   same	   time,	   while	   the	   controls	   are	   surely	   uncorrelated	  
with	  the	  residual	  term,	  it’s	  unlikely	  that	  the	  regression	  coefficients	  multiplying	  the	  
controls	  have	  a	  causal	  interpretation.	  We	  don’t	  imagine	  that	  the	  controls	  are	  as	  good	  
as	  randomly	  assigned	  and	  we	  needn’t	  care	  whether	  they	  are.	  The	  controls	  have	  a	  job	  
to	   do:	   they	  are	  the	  foundation	   for	  the	  conditional	  independence	  claim.	   Provided	   the	  
controls	  make	  this	  claim	  plausible,	  the	  coefficient	  𝛽	  can	  be	  seen	  as	  a	  causal	  effect.	  	  
The	  modern	  regression	  paradigm	  turns	  on	  the	  notion	  that	  the	  analyst	  has	  data	  
on	  control	  variables	  that	  generate	  apples-­‐to-­‐apples	  comparisons	  for	  the	  variable	  of	  
interest.	  Dale	  and	  Krueger	  (2002)	  explain	  what	  this	  means	  in	  their	  study:	  	  
	  
If,	   conditional	   on	   gaining	   admission,	   students	   choose	   to	   attend	   schools	   for	  
reasons	   that	   are	   independent	   of	   [unobserved	   determinants	   of	   earnings]	   then

students	   who	   were	   accepted	   and	   rejected	   by	   the	   same	   set	   of	   schools	   would	  
have	   the	   same	   expected	   value	   of	   [these	   determinants,	   the	   error	   term	   in	   their	  
model].	   Consequently,	   our	   proposed	   solution	   to	   the	   school	   selection	   problem	   is	  
to	  include	  an	  unrestricted	  set	  of	  dummy	  variables	  indicating	  groups	  of	  students	  
who	   received	   the	   same	   admissions	   decisions	   (i.e.,	   the	   same	   combination	   of	  
acceptances	  and	  rejections)	  from	  the	  same	  set	  of	  colleges.	  
	  
In	   our	   analysis	   of	   the	   Dale	   and	   Krueger	   data	   (reported	   in	   Chapter	   2	   of	   Angrist	  
and	   Pischke,	  2015),	   estimates	   from	   a	   regression	   with	   no	   controls	   show	   a	   large	  
private	   school	   effect	   of	   13.5	   log	   points.	   This	   shrinks	   to	   8.6	   log	   points	   after	  
controlling	   for	   the	   student’s	   own	   SAT	   scores,	   his	   or	   her	   family	   income,	   and	   a	   few	  
more	   demographic	   variables.	   But	   controlling	   for	   the	   schools	   to	   which	   a	   student	  
applied	   and	   was	   admitted	   (using	   many	   dummy	   variables)	   yields	   a	   small	   and	  
statistically	  insignificant	  private	  school	  effect	  of	  less	  than	  1	  percent.	  	  
Comparing	   regression	   results	   with	   increasing	   numbers	   of	   controls	   in	   this	   way—
that	  is,	  uncontrolled	  results,	  results	  with	  crude	  controls,	  and	  results	  with	  a	  control	  
variable	  that	  more	  plausibly	  addresses	  the	  issue	  of	  selection	  bias—offers	  powerful	  
insights.	  These	  insights	  help	  students	  understand	  why	  the	  last	  model	  is	  more	  likely	  
to	  have	  a	  causal	  interpretation	  than	  the	  first	  two.	  	  
First,	   we	   note	   in	   discussing	   these	   results	   that	   the	   large	   uncontrolled	   private	  
differential	   in	   wages	   is	   apparently	   driven	   entirely	   by	   selection	   bias.	   We	   learn	   this	  
from	  the	  fact	  that	  the	  raw	  effect	  vanishes	  after	  controlling	  for	  students’	  pre-­‐college	  
attributes,	   in	   this	   case	   ambition	   and	   ability	   as	   reflected	   in	   the	   set	   of	   schools	   a	  
student	  applies	  to	  and	  qualifies	  for.	  Of	  course,	  there	  may	  still	  be	  selection	  bias	  in	  the	  
private-­‐public	   contrast	   conditional	   on	   these	   controls.	   But	   because	   the	   controls	   are	  
coded	   from	   application	   and	   admissions	   decisions	   that	   predate	   college	   enrollment	  
decisions,	   they	   cannot	   themselves	   be	   a	   consequence	   of	   private	   school	   attendance.	  	  
They	   must	   be	   associated	   with	   differences	   in	   𝑌!! 	  that	   generate	   selection	   bias.	  
Eliminating	   these	   differences,	   that	   is,	   comparing	   students	   with	   similar	  𝑌!! ’s,	   is	  
therefore	   likely	   to	   generate	   private	   school	   effects	   that	   are	   less	   misleading	   than	  
simpler	  models	  omitting	  these	  controls.	  	  
We	  also	  show	  our	  students	  that	  after	  conditioning	  on	  application	  and	  admissions	  
variables,	   ability	   and	   family	   background	   variables	   in	   the	   form	   of	   SAT	   scores	   and	  
family	  income	  are	  uncorrelated	  with	  private	  school	  attendance.	  The	  finding	  of	  a	  zero	  
private-­‐school	   return	   is	   therefore	   insensitive	   to	   further	   control	   beyond	   a	   core	   set.	  
This	   argument	   uses	   the	   omitted	   variables	   bias	   formula,	   which	   we	   see	   as	   a	   kind	   of	  
golden	   rule	   for	   the	   modern	   regression	   practitioner	   (the	   rest	   of	   the	   framework	   is	  
commentary).	   Our	   regression	   estimates	   reveal	   robustness	   to	   further	   control	   that	  
we’d	  expect	  to	  see	  in	  a	  well-­‐run	  randomized	  trial.	  	  
Using	  a	  similar	  omitted-­‐variables-­‐type	  argument,	  we	  note	  that	  even	  if	  there	  are	  
other	   confounders	   that	   we	   haven’t	   controlled	   for,	   those	   that	   are	   positively	  
correlated	   with	   private	   school	   attendance	   are	   likely	   to	   be	   positively	   correlated	   with	  
earnings	   as	   well.	   Even	   if	   these	   variables	   remain	   omitted,	   their	   omission	   leads	   the	  
estimates	   computed	   with	   the	   variables	   at	   hand	   to	   overestimate	   the	   private	   school	  
premium,	  small	  as	  it	  already	  is.

Empirical	  applications	  like	  this	  demonstrate	  the	  modern	  approach	  to	  regression,	  
highlighting	   the	   nuanced	   assumptions	   needed	   for	   a	   causal	   interpretation	   of	  
regression	   parameters.3	   If	   the	   conditional	   independence	   assumption	   is	   violated,	  
regression	   methods	   fail	   to	   uncover	   causal	   effects	   and	   are	   likely	   misleading.	  
Otherwise,	   there’s	   hope	   for	   causal	   inference.	   Alas,	   the	   regression	   topics	   that	  
dominate	   econometrics	   teaching,	   including	   extensive	   discussions	   of	   classical	  
regression	   assumptions,	   functional	   form,	   multicollinearity,	   and	   matters	   related	   to	  
statistical	   inference	   and	   efficiency,	   pale	   in	   importance	   next	   to	   this	   live-­‐or-­‐die	   fact	  
about	  regression-­‐based	  research	  designs.	  	  
Which	  is	  not	  to	  say	  that	  causal	  inference	  using	  regression	  methods	  has	  now	  been	  
made	  easy.	  The	  question	  of	  what	  makes	  a	  good	  control	  variable	  is	  one	  of	  the	  most	  
challenging	   in	   empirical	   practice.	   Candidate	   control	   variables	   should	   be	   judged	   by	  
whether	   they	   make	   the	   conditional	   independence	   assumption	   more	   plausible,	   and	  
it’s	   often	   hard	   to	   tell.	   	   We	   therefore	   discuss	   many	   regression	   examples	   with	   our	  
students,	  all	  interesting,	  but	  some	  more	  convincing	  than	  others.	  	  A	  particular	  worry	  
is	   that	   not	   all	   controls	   are	   good	   controls,	   even	   if	   they’re	   related	   to	   both	  𝑃!   and  𝑌! .	  
Specific	  examples	  and	  discussion	  questions	  —	  “Should	  you	  control	  for	  occupation	  in	  
a	   wage	   equation	   meant	   to	   measure	   the	   economic	   returns	   to	   schooling?”	   —	  
illuminate	  the	  bad	  control	  issue	  and	  therefore	  warrant	  time	  in	  the	  classroom	  (and	  in	  
our	  books,	  Angrist	  and	  Pischke	  2009,	  2015).	  	  
	  
Take	  It	  or	  Leave	  It:	  Classical	  Regression	  Concerns	  
It	   is	   easiest	   to	   derive	   a	   controlled	   regression	   using	   the	   potential	   outcomes	  
framework	  and	  the	  conditional	  independence	  assumption	  when	  the	  causal	  effect	  is	  
the	  same	  for	  everyone,	  as	  assumed	  above.	  	  While	  this	  is	  an	  attractive	  simplification	  
for	   expository	   purposes,	   the	   key	   result	   is	   remarkably	   general.	   As	   long	   as	   the	  
regression	   function	   is	   suitably	   flexible,	   the	   regression	   parameter	   capturing   the  
causal   effect   of   interested   is   a	   weighted	   average	   of	   underlying	   covariate-­‐specific	  
causal	  effects.	  In	  fact,	  with	  discrete	  controls,	  regression	  can	  be	  viewed	  as	  a	  matching	  
estimator	   that	   automates	   the	   estimation	   of	   many	   possibly	   heterogeneous	   covariate-­‐
specific	  treatment	  effects,	  producing	  a	  single	  weighted	  average	  in	  one	  easy	  step.	  
More	  generally,	  linearity	  of	  the	  regression	  function	  is	  best	  seen	  as	  a	  convenient	  
approximation	   to	   more	   general	   underlying	   functional	   forms.	   	   This	   claim	   is	  
supported	   by	   pioneering	   theoretical	   studies	   such	   as	   White	  (1980b)	   and	  
Chamberlain	  (1982).	   To	   the	   best	   of	   our	   knowledge,	   the	   first	   textbook	   to	   highlight	  
these	   properties	   is	   Goldberger	  (1991),	   a	   graduate	   text	   never	   in	   wide	   use	   and	   one	  
rarely	   seen	   in	   undergraduate	   courses.	   Angrist	  (1998),	   Angrist	   and	   Krueger	  (1999),	  
and	  Angrist	  and	  Pischke	  (2009)	  develop	  the	  theoretical	  argument	  that	  regression	  is	  
a	  matching	  estimator	  for	  average	  treatment	  effects	  (see	  also	  Yitzhaki,	  1996).	  
An	   important	   consequence	   of	   this	   approximation	   and	   matchmaking	   view	   of	  
regression	  is	  that	  the	  assumptions	  behind	  the	  textbook	  linear	  regression	  model	  are	  
both	   implausible	   and	   irrelevant.	   Heteroskedasticity	   arises	   naturally	   as	   a	   result	   of	  
variation	  on	  the	  closeness	  between	  a	  regression	  fit	  and	  the	  underlying	  conditional	  
mean	  function	  it	  approximates,	  but	  the	  fact	  that	  the	  quality	  of	  the	  fit	  may	  vary	  does	  
not	   obviate	   the	   value	   of	   regression	   as	   a	   summarizer	   of	   economically	   meaningful	  
causal	  relationships.

Classical	   regression	   assumptions	   are	   helpful	   for	   the	   derivation	   of	   regression	  
standard	   errors.	   	   They	   simplify	   the	   math	   and	   the	   resulting	   formula	   reveals	   the	  
features	  of	  the	  data	  that	  determine	  statistical	  precision.	  This	  derivation	  takes	  little	  
of	   our	   class	   time,	   however.	   We	   don’t	   dwell	   on	   statistical	   tests	   for	   the	   validity	   of	  
assumptions	   or	   on	   generalized	   least	   squares	   fix-­‐ups	   for	   their	   failures.	   It	   seems	   to	   us	  
that	  most	  of	  what	  is	  usually	  taught	  on	  inference	  in	  an	  introductory	  undergraduate	  
class	  can	  be	  replaced	  with	  the	  phrase	  “use	  robust	  standard	  errors.”	  With	  a	  caution	  
about	  blind	  reliance	  on	  asymptotic	  approximations,	  we	  suggest	  our	  students	  follow	  
current	  research	  practice.	  As	  noted	  by	  White	  (1980a)	  and	  others,	  the	  robust	  formula	  
addresses	   the	   statistical	   consequences	   of	   heteroskedasticity	   and	   non-­‐linearity	   in	  
cross-­‐sectional	   data.	   Autocorrelation	  in	  time	  series	  data	  can	  similarly	  be	  handled	  by	  
Newey	  and	  West	  (1987)	  standard	  errors,	  while	  cluster	  methods	  address	  correlation	  
across	   cross-­‐sectional	   units	   or	   in	   panel	   data	   (Moulton,	  1986;	   Arellano,	  1987;	  
Bertrand,	  Duflo,	  and	  Mullainathan,	  2004).	  	  
	  
	  
In	  Another	  Land:	  Econometrics	  Texts	  and	  Teaching	  	  
	  
Traditional	   econometrics	   textbooks	   are	   thin	   on	   empirical	   examples.	   	   In	  
Johnston’s	  (1972)	  classic	  text,	  the	  first	  empirical	  application	  is	  a	  bivariate	  regression	  
linking	  road	  casualties	  to	  the	  number	  of	  licensed	  vehicles.	  This	  example	  focuses	  on	  
computation,	   an	   understandable	   concern	   at	   the	   time,	   but	   Johnston	   doesn’t	   explain	  
why	   the	   relationship	   between	   casualties	   and	   licenses	   is	   interesting	   or	   what	   the	  
estimates	  might	  mean.	  Gujarati’s	  (1978)	  first	  empirical	  example	  is	  more	  substantive,	  
a	   Cobb-­‐Douglas	   production	   function	   estimated	   with	   a	   few	   annual	   observations.	  
Production	   functions,	   implicitly	   causal,	   are	   a	   fundamental	   building	   block	   of	  
economic	  theory.	  The	  discussion	  here	  helpfully	  interprets	  magnitudes	  and	  considers	  
whether	   the	   estimates	   might	   be	   consistent	   with	   constant	   returns	   to	   scale.	   But	   this	  
application	  doesn’t	  appear	  until	  page	  107.	  	  
Decades	  later,	  real	  empirical	  work	  was	  still	  sparse	  in	  the	  leading	  texts,	  and	  the	  
presentation	   of	   empirical	   examples	   often	   remained	   focused	   on	   mathematical	   and	  
statistical	   technicalities.	   In	   an	   essay	   published	   fifteen	   years	   ago,	   Becker	   and	  
Greene	  (2001)	   surveyed	   econometrics	   texts	   and	   teaching	   at	   the	   turn	   of	   the	  
millennium:	  	  
	  
Econometrics	  and	  statistics	  are	  often	  taught	  as	  branches	  of	  mathematics,	  even	  
when	   taught	   in	   business	   schools	   ...	   the	   focus	   in	   the	   textbooks	   and	   teaching	  
materials	   is	   on	   presenting	   and	   explaining	   theory	   and	   technical	   details	   with	  
secondary	  attention	  given	  to	  applications,	  which	  are	  often	  manufactured	  to	  fit	  
the	   procedure	   at	   hand	   ...	   applications	   are	   rarely	   based	   on	   events	   reported	   in	  
financial	  newspapers,	  business	  magazines	  or	  scholarly	  journals	  in	  economics.	  
	  
Following	  a	  broader	  trend	  towards	  empiricism	  in	  economic	  research	  (documented,	  
for	   example,	   in	   Hamermesh,	  2013	   and	   Angrist	   et	   al.,	   2017),	   today’s	   texts	   are	   more	  
empirical	  than	  those	  they’ve	  replaced.	  In	  particular,	  modern	  econometrics	  texts	  are	  

10

more	   likely	   than	   those	   described	   by	   Becker	   and	   Greene	   to	   integrate	   empirical	  
examples	   throughout,	   and	   often	   come	   with	   websites	   where	   students	   can	   find	   real	  
economic	  data	  for	  problem	  sets	  and	  practice.	  	  
But	   the	   news	   on	   the	   textbook	   front	   is	   not	   all	   good.	   Many	   of	   today’s	   textbook	  
examples	   are	   still	   contrived	   or	   poorly	   motivated.	   	   From	   our	   viewpoint,	   more	  
disappointing	  than	  the	  uneven	  quality	  of	  empirical	  applications	  in	  the	  contemporary	  
econometrics	   library	   is	   the	   failure	   to	   discuss	   modern	   empirical	   tools.	   Other	   than	  
Stock	   and	   Watson	   (2015),	   which	   comes	   closest	   to	   embracing	   the	   modern	   agenda,	  
none	   of	   the	   modern	   undergraduate	   econometrics	   texts	   surveyed	   below	   mentions	  
regression-­‐discontinuity	   methods,	   for	   example.	   Likewise,	   we	   see	   little	   or	   no	  
discussion	   of	   the	   threats	   to	   validity	   that	   might	   confound	   differences-­‐in-­‐differences	  
style	   policy	   analysis,	   even	   though	   empirical	   work	   of	   this	   sort	   is	   now	   ubiquitous.	  
Econometrics	  texts	  appear	  to	  risk	  becoming	  irrelevant	  to	  empirical	  practice.	  	  
To	   put	   these	   and	   other	   claims	   about	   textbook	   content	   on	   a	   firmer	   empirical	  
foundation,	   we	   classified	   the	   content	   of	   12	   books,	   six	   from	   the	   1970s	   and	   six	  
currently	  in	  wide	  use.	  Our	  list	  of	  classics	  was	  constructed	  by	  identifying	  1970s-­‐era	  
editions	   of	   the	   volumes	   in	   Becker	   and	   Greene’s	   (2001)	   Table	   1,	   which	   lists	  
undergraduate	   textbooks	   in	   wide	   use	   when	   they	   wrote	   their	   essay.	   We	   bought	  
copies	  of	  these	  older	  first	  or	  second	  edition	  books.	  Our	  list	  of	  classic	  texts	  contains	  
Kmenta	   (1971),	   Johnston	   (1972),	   Pindyck	   and	   Rubinfeld	   (1976),	   Gujarati	   (1978),	  
Intriligator	   (1978),	   and	   Kennedy	   (1979).	   The	   divide	   between	   graduate	   and	  
undergraduate	   books	   was	   murkier	   in	   the	   1970s:	   unlike	   today’s	   undergraduate	  
books,	   some	   of	   these	   older	   texts	   use	   linear	   algebra.	   Intriligator,	   Johnston,	   and	  
Kmenta	   are	   noticeably	   more	   advanced	   than	   the	   other	   three.	   	   	   We	   therefore	  
summarize	  1970s	  book	  content	  with	  and	  without	  these	  three	  included.	  	  	  
Our	  contemporary	  texts	  are	  the	  six	  most	  often	  listed	  books	  on	  reading	  lists	  found	  
on	   the	   Open	   Syllabus	   Project	   web	   site	   (http://opensyllabusproject.org/).	  
Specifically,	   our	   modern	   market	   leaders	   are	   those	   found	   at	   the	   top	   of	   a	   list	  
generated	   by	   filtering	   the	   Project’s	   “syllabus	   explorer”	   search	   engine	   for	  
“Economics”	   and	   then	   searching	   for	   “Econometrics.”	   The	   resulting	   list	   consists	   of	  
Kennedy	   (2008),	   Gujarati	   and	   Porter	   (2009),	   Stock	   and	   Watson	   (2015),	   Wooldridge	  
(2016),	  Dougherty	  (2016),	  and	  Studenmund	  (2017).4	  	  
Recognizing	  that	  such	  an	  endeavor	  will	  always	  be	  imperfect,	  we	  classified	  book	  
content	  into	  the	  categories	  shown	  in	  Table	  1.	  	  This	  scheme	  covers	  the	  vast	  majority	  
of	  the	  material	  in	  the	  12	  books	  described	  in	  Table	  2,	  as	  well	  as	  in	  many	  others	  we’ve	  
used	   or	   read.	   Our	   classification	   scheme	   also	   covers	   three	   of	   the	   tools	   for	   which	  
growth	   in	   usage	   appears	   most	   impressive	   in	   the	   bibliometric	   data	   tabulated	   by	  
Panhans	   and	   Singleton	  (2016),	   specifically,	   instrumental	   variables,	   regression-­‐
discontinuity	  methods,	  and	  differences–in-­‐differences	  estimators.5	  Our	  classification	  
strategy	   counts	   pages	   devoted	   to	   each	   topic,	   omitting	   material	   in	   appendices	   and	  
exercises,	   and	   omitting	   remedial	   material	   on	   mathematics	   and	   statistics.	  
Independently,	   we	   also	   counted	   pages	   devoted	   to	   real	   empirical	   examples,	   that	   is,	  
presentations	   of	   econometric	   results	   computed	   using	   genuine	   economic	   data.	   This	  
scheme	  for	  counting	  examples	  omits	  the	  many	  textbook	  illustrations	  that	  use	  made-­‐
up	  numbers.

Not	  Fade	  Away	  
For	   the	   most	   part,	   legacy	   texts	   have	   a	   uniform	   structure:	   they	   begin	   by	  
introducing	   a	   linear	   model	   for	   an	   economic	   outcome	   variable,	   followed	   closely	   by	  
saying	   that	   the	   error	   term	   is	   assumed	   to	   be	   either	   mean-­‐independent	   of	   or	  
uncorrelated	   with	   regressors.	   The	   purpose	   of	   this	   model	   —	   whether	   it’s	   a	   causal	  
relationship	  in	  the	  sense	  of	  describing	  the	  consequences	  of	  regressor	  manipulation,	  
a	  statistical	  forecasting	  tool,	  or	  a	  parameterized	  conditional	  expectation	  function	   —	  
is	  usually	  unclear.	  	  
The	   textbook	   introduction	   of	   a	   linear	   model	   with	   orthogonal	   or	   mean-­‐
independent	   errors	   is	   typically	   followed	   by	   a	   list	   of	   technical	   assumptions	   like	  
homoskedasticity,	   variable	   (yet	   non-­‐stochastic!)	   regressors,	   and	   lack	   of	  
multicollinearity.	   These	   assumptions	   are	   used	   to	   derive	   the	   good	   statistical	  
properties	   of	   the	   ordinary	   least	   squares	   estimator	   in	   the	   classical	   linear	   model:	  
unbiasedness,	  simple	  formulas	  for	  standard	  errors,	  and	  the	  Gauss-­‐Markov	  Theorem,	  
(in	   which	   OLS	   is	   shown	   to	   be	   a	   best	   linear	   unbiased	   estimator,	   or	   BLUE).	   As	   we	  
report	   in	   Table	   2,	   this	   initial	   discussion	   of	   Regression	   Properties	   consumes	   an	  
average	   of	   11	   to	   12	   percent	   of	   the	   classic	   textbooks.	   Regression	   Inference,	   which	  
usually	   comes	   next,	   gets	   an	   average	   of	   roughly	   13	   percent	   of	   page	   space	   in	   these	  
traditional	  books.	  	  
The	  most	  deeply	  covered	  topic	  in	  our	  taxonomy,	  accounting	  for	  about	  20	  percent	  
of	  material,	  is	  Assumption	  Failures	  and	  Fix-­‐ups.	  This	  includes	  diagnostics	  and	  first	  aid	  
for	   problems	   like	   autocorrelation,	   heteroskedasticity,	   and	   multicollinearity.	   Relief	  
for	  most	  of	  these	  maladies	  comes	  in	  the	  form	  of	  generalized	  least	  squares.	  Another	  
important	   topic	   in	   legacy	   texts	   is	   Simultaneous	   Equations	   Models,	   consuming	   14	  
percent	  of	  page	  space	  in	  the	  more	  elementary	  texts.	  	  The	  percentage	  given	  over	  to	  
orthodox	   simultaneous	   equations	   model	   rises	   to	   18	   when	   the	   sample	   includes	   more	  
advanced	   texts.	   Ironically,	   perhaps,	   Assumption	  Failures	  and	  Fix-­‐ups	   claim	   an	   even	  
larger	   share	   of	   the	   classics	   when	   more	   advanced	   books	   are	   excluded.	   These	   older	  
books	   also	   devote	   considerable	   space	   to	   Time	   Series,	   while	   Panel	   Data	   gets	   little	  
attention	  across	  the	  board.	  	  
A	  striking	  feature	  of	  Table	  2	  is	  how	  similar	  the	  distribution	  of	  topic	  coverage	  in	  
contemporary	   market	   leading	   econometrics	   texts	   is	   to	   the	   distribution	   in	   the	  
classics.	  As	  in	  the	  Stones’	  Age,	  well	  over	  half	  of	  the	  material	  in	  contemporary	  texts	  is	  
concerned	   with	   Regression	   Properties,	   Regression	   Inference,	   Functional	   Form,	   and	  
Assumption	  Failures	  and	  Fix-­‐ups.	  The	  clearest	  change	  across	  book	  generations	  is	  the	  
reduced	   space	   allocated	   to	   Simultaneous	  Equations	  Models.	   This	   presumably	   reflects	  
the	   decline	   in	   the	   use	   of	   an	   orthodox	   multi-­‐equation	   framework,	   especially	   in	  
macroeconomics.	  	  The	  reduced	  coverage	  of	  Simultaneous	  Equations	  has	  made	  space	  
for	   modest	   attention	   to	   Panel	   Data	   and	   Causal	   Effects,	   but	   the	   biggest	   single	  
expansion	   in	   modern	   texts	   has	   been	   in	   the	   coverage	   of	   Functional	   Form	   (mostly	  
discrete	  choice	  and	  limited	  dependent	  variable	  models).	  
Some	  of	  the	  volumes	  on	  our	  current	  book	  list	  have	  been	  through	  many	  editions,	  
with	  first	  editions	  published	  in	  the	  Stones’	  Age.	  	  It’s	  perhaps	  unsurprising	  that	  the	  
topic	   distribution	   in	   Gujarati	   and	   Porter	   (2009)	   looks	   a	   lot	   like	   that	   in	   Gujarati	  
(1978).	  	  But	  more	  recent	  entrants	  to	  the	  textbook	  market	  also	  deviate	  little	  from	  the	  

12

classic	  template.	  	  On	  the	  positive	  side,	  recent	  market	  entrants	  are	  more	  likely	  to	  at	  
least	  mention	  modern	  topics.	  	  	  
The	   bottom	   row	   of	   Table	   2	   reveals	   the	   moderate	   use	   of	   empirical	   examples	   in	  
the	  Stones’	  Age:	  about	  15	  percent	  of	  pages	  in	  the	  classics	  are	  devoted	  to	  illustrations	  
involving	  real	  data.	  	  This	  average	  conceals	  a	  fair	  bit	  of	  variation,	  ranging	  from	  zero	  
(no	   examples	   at	   all)	   to	   more	   than	   a	   third	   of	   page	   space	   devoted	   to	   applications.	  	  
Remarkably,	  the	  most	  empirically	  oriented	  textbook	  in	  our	  12	  book	  sample	  remains	  
Pindyck	  and	  Rubinfeld	  (1976),	  one	  of	  the	  classics.	  	  Although	  the	  field	  has	  moved	  to	  
an	   average	   empirical	   content	   rate	   between	   25-­‐30	   percent,	   no	   contemporary	   text	  
quite	  matches	  their	  coverage	  of	  examples.6	  	  	  
	  
BLUE	  Turns	  to	  Grey:	  Econometrics	  Course	  Coverage	  
Many	   instructors	   rely	   heavily	   on	   their	   lecture	   notes,	   using	   textbooks	   only	   as	   a	  
supplement	   or	   a	   source	   of	   exercises.	   We	   might	   therefore	   see	   more	   of	   the	   modern	  
empirical	  paradigm	  in	  course	  outlines	  and	  reading	  lists	  than	  we	  see	  in	  textbooks.	  To	  
explore	   this	   possibility,	   we	   collected	   syllabuses	   and	   lecture	   schedules	   for	  
undergraduate	   econometrics	   courses	   from	   a	   wide	   variety	   of	   colleges	   and	  
universities.7	  	  
Our	  sample	  of	  syllabuses	  covers	  courses	  at	  the	  ten	  largest	  campuses	  in	  each	  of	  
eight	   types	   of	   institutions.	   The	   eight	   groups	   are	   research	   universities	   (very	   high	  
activity),	   research	   universities	   (high	   activity),	   doctoral/research	   universities,	   and	  
baccalaureate	  colleges,	  with	  each	  of	  these	  four	  split	  into	  public	  and	  private	  schools.	  
The	   resulting	   sample	   includes	   diverse	   institutions	   like	   Ohio	   State	   University,	   New	  
York	  University,	  Harvard	  University,	  East	  Carolina	  University,	  American	  University,	  
U.S.	  Military	  Academy,	  Texas	  Christian	  University,	  Calvin	  College,	  and	  Hope	  College.	  	  
Each	   of	   the	   eight	   types	   of	   schools	   we	   targeted	   is	   represented	   in	   the	   sample,	   but	  
larger	   and	  more	  prestigious	  institutions	  are	  over-­‐represented.	  Most	  syllabuses	  are	  
for	   courses	   taught	   since	   2014,	   but	   the	   oldest	   is	   from	   2009.	   A	   few	   schools	   contribute	  
more	  than	   one	   syllabus,	   but	   these	   are	   averaged	   so	   each	   school	   contributes	   only	   one	  
observation	   to	   our	   tabulations.	   The	   appendix	   lists	   the	   38	   schools	   included	   in	   the	  
syllabus	  data	  set.	  	  
For	   each	   school	   contributing	   course	   information,	   we	   recorded	   whether	   the	  
topics	   listed	   in	   Table	   1	   are	   covered.	   A	   subset	   of	   schools	   also	   provided	   detailed	  
lecture-­‐by-­‐lecture	   schedules	   that	   show	   the	   time	   devoted	   to	   each	   topic.	   It’s	   worth	  
noting	   that	   the	   amount	   of	   information	   that	   can	   be	   gleaned	   from	   reading	   lists	   and	  
course	  schedules	  varies	  across	  courses.	  For	  example,	  most	  syllabuses	  cover	  material	  
we’ve	  classified	  as	  Multivariate	  Regression,	  but	  some	  don’t	  list	  Regression	  Inference	  
separately,	  presumably	   covering	   inference	   as	   part	   of	   the	   regression	   module	   without	  
spelling	  this	  out	  on	  the	  reading	  list.	  As	  a	  result,	  broader	  topics	  appear	  to	  get	  more	  
coverage.	  	  
With	   this	   caveat	   in	   mind,	   the	   first	   column	   of	   Table	   3	   suggests	   a	   distribution	   of	  
econometric	   lecture	   time	   that	   has	   much	   in	   common	   with	   the	   topic	   distribution	   in	  
textbooks.	   In	   particular,	   well	   over	   half	   of	   class	   time	   goes	   to	   lectures	   on	   Regression	  
Properties,	   Regression	   Inference,	   Assumption	   Failures	   and	   Fix-­‐ups,	   and	   Functional	  
Form.	  Consistent	  with	  this	  distribution,	  column	  2	  of	  the	  table	  reveals	  that,	  except	  for	  

13

Regression	  Properties,	   these	   topics	   are	   covered	   by	   most	   reading	   lists.	   The	  Regression	  
Properties	  topic	  is	  very	  likely	  covered	  under	  other	  regression	  headings.	  	  
Also	   paralleling	   the	   textbook	   material	   described	   in	   Table	   2,	   our	   tabulation	   of	  
lecture	   time	   shows	   that	   just	   under	   6	   percent	   of	   course	   schedules	   is	   devoted	   to	  
coverage	  of	  topics	  related	  to	  Causal	  Effects,	  Differences-­‐in-­‐differences	  and	  Regression	  
Discontinuity	   Methods.	   This	   is	   only	   a	   modest	   step	   beyond	   the	   modern	   textbook	  
average	  of	  3.6	  percent	  for	  this	  set	  of	  topics.	  Single-­‐equation	  Instrumental	  Variables	  
methods	   get	   only	   3.9	   percent	   of	   lecture	   time,	   less	   than	   we	   see	   in	   the	   average	   for	  
textbooks,	  both	  old	  and	  new.	  	  
Always	  looking	  on	  the	  bright	  side	  of	  life,	  we	  happily	  note	  that	  Table	  3	  shows	  that	  
over	   a	   quarter	   of	   our	   sampled	   instructors	   allocate	   at	   least	   some	   lecture	   time	   to	  
Causal	  Effects	  and	  Differences-­‐in-­‐differences.	  A	  healthy	  minority	  (nearly	  17	  percent)	  
also	  find	  time	  for	  at	  least	  some	  discussion	  of	  Regression	  Discontinuity	  Methods.	  This	  
suggests	  that	  econometric	  instructors	  are	  ahead	  of	  the	  econometrics	  book	  market.	  
Many	  younger	  instructors	  will	  have	  used	  modern	  empirical	  methods	  in	  their	  Ph.D.	  
work,	   so	   they	   probably	   want	   to	   share	   this	   material	   with	   their	   students.	   Textbook	  
authors	   are	   probably	   older,	   on	   average,	   than	   instructors,	   and	   therefore	   less	   likely	   to	  
have	  personal	  experience	  with	  tools	  emphasized	  by	  the	  modern	  causal	  agenda.	  	  
	  
	  
Out	  of	  Time	  
	  
Undergraduate	   econometrics	   instructions	   is	   overdue	   for	   a	   paradigm	   shift	   in	  
three	  directions.	  	  One	  is	  a	  focus	  on	  causal	  questions	  and	  empirical	  examples,	  rather	  
than	   models	   and	   math.	   	   Another	   is	   a	   revision	   of	   the	   anachronistic	   classical	  
regression	   framework,	   away	   from	   explaining	   economic	   processes	   and	   towards	  
controlled	   statistical	   comparisons.	   	   The	   third	   is	   an	   emphasis	   on	   modern	   quasi-­‐
experimental	  tools.	  	  
We	   recognize	   that	   change	   is	   hard.	   Our	   own	   reading	   lists	   of	   a	   decade	   or	   so	   ago	  
look	   much	  like	  those	  we’ve	  summarized	  here.	  But	  our	  approach	  to	  instruction	   has	  
evolved	   as	   we’ve	   pondered	   the	   disturbing	   gap	   between	   what	   we	   do	   and	   what	   we	  
teach.	   The	   econometrics	   we	   use	   in	   our	   research	   is	   interesting,	   relevant,	   and	  
satisfying.	  	  	  
Why	  shouldn’t	  our	  students	  get	  some	  satisfaction	  too?

Appendix:	  Syllabus	  Data	  
	  
We	  contacted	  the	  largest	  schools	  in	  each	  of	  the	  following	  four	  groups,	  defined	  by	  
aggregating	  Carnegie	  Classification	  codes	  in	  IPEDS	  as	  follows:	  	  
• 1,2	  Research	  Universities	  (very	  high	  research	  activity)	  (2010	  classification	  
code	  #15)	  	  
• 3,4	  Research	  Universities	  (high	  research	  activity)	  (2010	  classification	  code	  
#16)	  	  
• 5,6	  Doctoral/Research	  Universities	  (2010	  classification	  code	  #17)	  	  
• 7,8	  Baccalaureate	  Colleges—Arts	  &	  Sciences	  (2010	  classification	  code	  #21)	  
The	  two	  codes	  for	  each	  of	  these	  four	  groups	  reflect	  a	  division	  into	  public	  and	  
private	  schools,	  for	  a	  total	  of	  eight	  categories.	  For	  example,	  the	  first	  category	  
consists	  of	  public	  universities	  with	  very	  high	  research	  activity.	  We	  omitted	  private	  
for-­‐profit	  institutions.	  The	  latest	  Carnegie	  classification	  scheme	  (revised	  February	  
2016)	  can	  be	  found	  at	  http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/methodology/basic.php.	  
Although	  we	  used	  the	  2010	  scheme,	  in	  practice,	  this	  matters	  little.	  	  
We	  attempted	  to	  collect	  undergraduate	  reading	  lists	  and	  course	  schedules	  for	  up	  
to	  10	  of	  the	  largest	  schools	  in	  each	  of	  the	  8	  categories	  defined	  above.	  This	  
information	  was	  obtained	  by	  searching	  for	  publicly	  posted	  material	  and/or	  
contacting	  instructors.	  We	  looked	  for	  the	  most	  recent	  information	  available.	  	  
We	  obtained	  45	  reading	  lists	  from	  38	  schools	  and	  lecture	  schedules	  for	  15	  
courses.	  The	  lecture	  schedules	  detail	  the	  number	  of	  lectures	  or	  weeks	  a	  course	  
spends	  on	  particular	  topics.	  	  Table	  A2	  displays	  the	  list	  of	  universities	  from	  which	  we	  
obtained	  reading	  lists,	  and	  Table	  A3	  shows	  some	  summary	  statistics.
