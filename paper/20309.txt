ABSTRACT
In settings with poor formal contract enforcement, profitable investments are likely unrealized. While
social closeness can mitigate contractual incompleteness, we examine how to improve the preponderance
of cases where contracting parties cannot rely upon social ties. We ask if a community can enlist members
to monitor transactions or punish offending parties.
We conduct a laboratory experiment in 40 Indian villages, with 960 non-anonymized subjects, where
we have social network data. Participants play modified sender-receiver investment games, with and
without third-party monitors and punishers. We examine whether network centrality of the third party
increases efficiency of interaction. Furthermore, we decompose the efficiency increase into a monitoring
channel (central third parties are valuable since they may influence reputations) and an enforcement
channel (central third parties may be more able to punish without fear of retaliation).
Assigning a third party at the 75th percentile of the centrality distribution (as compared to the 25th)
increases efficiency by 21% relative to the mean: we attribute 2/5 of the effect to monitoring and 3/5
to enforcement. The largest efficiency increase occurs when senders and receivers are socially distant,
unable to maintain efficient levels autonomously. Results cannot be explained by demographics such
as elite status, caste, wealth or gender.
Our findings show not every member is equally well-equipped to be part of a local institution. Knowing
that a central third party observes their interaction increases sender-receiver efficiency. More importantly,
to be able to punish someone, the third party must be important in the community.

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

1. Introduction
Developing countries are often plagued by weak legal enforcement of contracts.
For example, in India it takes 1,420 days on average to resolve a commercial dispute
between two businesses.1 Strategies for mitigating these weak institutional environments may include entering into relational contracts or turning to individuals
with extra-legal authority to help resolve disputes (Dixit 2011; Greif 1993; Greif
et al. 1994). This paper focuses on the role that third-parties can play in helping to
improve the scope of trade. Namely, we ask which members of a local community
are best suited to serve in the role of arbiter and which enforcement tools these
individuals should be given.
A network represents a pattern of economic and social relationships between
agents. Each agent tends to only interact with a subset of others, and the pattern
of local interactions woven together paints a picture of a global social structure.
While social proximity – that is, being close in a social network – can help to sustain interactions, when parties are socially distant, mutually beneficial transactions
may remain infeasible (Bowles and Gintis 2004; Chandrasekhar et al. 2013; Goeree
et al. 2010; Glaeser et al. 2000; Grimm and Mengel 2009; Leider et al. 2009; and
Ligon and Schechter 2012). Relying only on social closeness to substitute for formal enforcement has its limitations: it precludes any number of useful transactions
involving the vast set of people who aren’t closely linked.2 In our setting, only 16%
of possible contracting partners are of social distance two or closer. Thus, there is
a natural role for institutions to contribute to contract enforcement.
In this paper, we address whether, an authority figure from the community can
help to sustain cooperative behavior. In particular, we focus on whether the network
importance (centrality3) of a local third-party monitor or enforcer influences the
extent to which the individual can serve as an effective outside institution.4 Network
centrality captures the ease with which an individual passes and acquires information

Examples include co-investment opportunities that arise with fellow community members who
are not one’s friend, job referrals where the referrer must vouch for the referee, contributions to a
public good involving more than one’s local set of social links.
3
We will use eigenvector centrality due to its natural interpretation in a simple information passing
or stochastic meeting story, which we discuss below. We do not mean to suggest that this is the
only (or exact) notion of network centrality relevant in the interactions we study.
4
To our knowledge, this issue has not been studied in the literature. A related, though distinct
analysis comes from the theoretical literature; Fainmesser (2014) shows that in environments where
bilateral traders cannot maintain efficient exchange, central enough intermediaries can exploit their
position to facilitate trade.

to and from others (see e.g., Jackson 2008 and Golub and Lever 2010). Central
individuals may make effective arbiters because of their ability to spread information
about the transactions to the rest of the community (reputation). It may also be the
case that they are better able to wield tools for punishing violations (enforcement):
less encumbered by the fear of retaliation by others, they may be able to threaten
effectively with a punishment. We conduct a high-stakes laboratory experiment in
the field designed to separate between these two channels. We also compare networkbased authority to other naturally-arising hierarchy measures in the community such
as caste, elite status, and gender.
We play two- and three-party investment games (modeled after Berg et al. 1995;
Charness et al. 2008; and Fehr and Fischbacher 2004) in 40 rural Indian villages. Our
setting is unique because of the availability of detailed demographic and network
information available for most community members collected in previous work by
Banerjee et al. (2013). We are precisely interested in understanding how positions
of individuals in the actual community are brought into the games, and therefore,
all experimental sessions are non-anonymized. This way, we bring individuals’ deep
and persistent relationships into the lab, which cannot be artificially induced in an
anonymous lab experiment.
The two-party game is a natural benchmark for measuring the extent to which
social proximity can alone improve outcomes. In this game, a sender (S) chooses
how much of her endowment to send to the receiver (R), and any transfers triple in
value. The receiver then determines how much to return to the sender. The initial
amount sent by the receiver measures the efficiency of the transaction.
Our goal is to determine if outcomes can improve under the presence of specific
types of third-party intervention and whether these improvements are due to reputational or enforcement channels. For this, we add two additional treatments. To
investigate reputation, we assign a third party (T ) to simply observe the sender and
receiver transfers. The logic is that a monitor can observe misbehavior and she can
either pass this information to others or, more subtly, may interact in the future
with the sender or the receiver in other walks of life in the future. More central third
parties are better positioned to pass information to a greater share of the population
and are also more likely to interact with the sender or receiver in the future. To capture enforcement, we further give the third party the ability to punish the receiver.
In this treatment, the third party both has the monitoring/reputation channel but
additionally can levy a fine – an observable punishment – on the receiver in the
game itself. In both cases, we are particularly interested in how the effectiveness
of the third party may increase with her centrality in the network. By differencing

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

these treatments, we can identify enforcement channels (as a whole) separated from
the monitoring effect alone.
Our core results are as follows. First, third parties who are more central increase
the level of efficiency relative to their less central counterparts. Specifically, sender
transfers increase substantially – by 21% of the mean when the third party is at the
75th percentile as compared to the 25th percentile of the centrality distribution –
when the third party is given the ability to punish. Decomposing this into enforcement and monitoring channels, we find that about 3/5 of the effect comes from the
enforcement channel (an effect of about 12% of the mean) whereas 2/5 of the effect
comes from the monitoring channel (an effect of about 9% of the mean).
Second, third parties are precisely more effective when the sender and receiver
are socially distant. Thus, in exactly the environment identified by the preceding
literature where lack of commitment contracts severely hurts efficiency, we see that
introducing a central third party who can levy a fine generates great benefits to
efficiency.
Third, we also show that other natural measures of social hierarchy cannot match
the effectiveness of a network-central punisher. Third parties (monitors and punishers) of elite status, of high caste, or male do not improve outcomes. Additionally,
note that all of our our networks results condition on these demographic variables5
interacted with treatment, meaning that the network effects are not simply proxying
for classical notions of social hierarchies.6
Finally, adding up over all triples of sender, receiver and third party, we find that
on average adding a third party to a two-party investment game neither increases
nor decreases sender transfers. But, as mentioned above, this masks a striking
and predictable heterogeneity in line with the literature. Socially close senders
and receivers achieve better outcomes on their own, and consistent with previous
work by Fehr and Gächter (2002), adding a third party generates some crowdout.
However, for otherwise inefficient pairs of socially far senders and receivers, the thirdparty institution may improve outcomes. We find that high-centrality punishers are
able to substitute for the lack of social proximity between the sender-receiver pairs;
far sender-receiver pairs under a high centrality third-party punisher behave in a
manner similar to socially-close sender-receiver pairs. However, relative to the twoparty game, adding a punisher who is peripheral in the social network is detrimental
to efficiency and crowds out transfers.

enforcement channel is particularly robust to the inclusion or omission of any control, though
our monitoring channel effects depend on the controls and become very noisy without them.

Without formal contracts, the fact that individuals have repeated, systematic
interactions with a local set of (socially proximate) individuals is more than enough
to sustain cooperative behavior. But broader interactions – involving members
from the community at a distance– require mediation. Not all individuals in a
community are equally well-equipped to handle this role. Specifically, those who
are central in the social network are the best arbiters. While they do exhibit a
monitoring effect, their effectiveness appears to come largely from the fact that they
are better equipped to utilize the punishment technology given to them. Further,
the centrality effect is conditional on demographic-by-treatment controls: thus it is
not proxying for leadership status, caste status or gender. This tells us that network
position is crucial in institutional design. Further, from a policy perspective, our
results suggest that selecting informal arbiters on the basis of caste or occupational
status alone may not be so effective. Network importance instead may be able to
substitute for a formal contracting technology.
Structure of the Paper. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
section 2, we describe the experimental design. Section 3 contains an overview of
our subject pool as well as a summary of the available network and demographic
data.. We introduce our empirical strategy in Section 4. In section 5 we present the
results, and section 6 concludes.

2. Experiment
Our experiments were conducted in the summer and fall of 2010 in 40 villages
in Karnataka, India which range from a 1.5 to 3 hour’s drive from Bangalore. The
villages are independent – the median distance is 46 kilometers between two villages. In each village, 24 individuals aged 18 to 50 were recruited to take part in
the experiments. As an incentive to attend, participants were paid a show-up fee
of INR 20 and were told they would have the opportunity to win additional money.
We chose these individuals as we had access to village census demographics as well
as unique social network data, previously collected in part by the authors. The data
set is described more below in Section 3 and in detail in Banerjee et al. (2013). The
network represents social connections between individuals in a village with twelve
dimensions of possible links, including relatives, friends, creditors, debtors, advisors, and religious company. We work with an undirected and unweighted network,
taking the union across these dimensions, following Banerjee et al. (2013) and Chandrasekhar et al. (2013). As such, we have extremely detailed data on social linkages,

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

6

not only between our experimental participants but also about the embedding of
the individuals in the social fabric at large.
The survey data also includes information about caste, elite status, wealth proxies,
gender, age, and educational attainment. An individual is of low caste for our
analysis if they belong to any of the historically disadvantaged scheduled castes or
scheduled tribes (SC/ST). A local leader or elite is someone who is a gram panchayat
member, self-help group official, anganwadi teacher, doctor, school headmaster, or
the owner of the main village shop.7 To construct a wealth index, we use survey
information on house size, electrification, building materials, and toilet amenities.
Our experimental design has three treatments (T1-3). As described below, for
every treatment, we use individuals who are randomized into roles: sender, receiver
and third party. Additionally, we took care to ensure that no individual participated
in any game with any other individual more than once.
2.1. Two-Party Experimental Benchmark. We consider an environment where
there are two parties who do not have access to formal contracting. We begin with
an important benchmark, the two-party investment game (T1). Later, we will add
to this a third-party institution.
In this benchmark game, two participants are selected at random and are assigned
the roles of S and R. The players are given endowments of Rs. 60 each. S moves
first and must decide how much of her endowment to transfer to R (τS ∈ [0, 60]).
The receiver then receives 3 × τS (i.e., the size of the transfer triples).
In the second stage of the game, R decides how much of his or her wealth from the
game to return to S (τR ∈ [0, 60 + 3τS ]). Here, the final payoff for S is 60 − τS + τR ,
and the final payoff for R is 60 + 3τS − τR . Note that in this two-period game, R will
return τR = 0 in any Nash Equilibrium, and by backward induction, S never makes
a strictly positive transfer τS , However, any efficient outcome is one where τS = 60.
This setting mimics a situation where there are efficiency gains from cooperating or
co-investing, but there are no formal contracting tools to enforce positive transfers ex
post. This game allows us to document the degree of efficiency a pair of individuals
alone can reach.
Previous research in both the lab and the field suggests that social proximity may
substitute for formal contracting institutions.8 Much of the focus of previous work

has been on whether social proximity generates good behavior because of altruism
or reciprocity, though it is not our aim here to separate such things. Let d (i, j)
denote the minimum path length between individuals i and j, which is the social
distance between the two parties. A unit increase in social distance reduces social
proximity by 1. We estimate the value of social distance d (S, R) between S and
R in our specific setting and also measure how far contracting outcomes between
socially distant (S,R) pairs are from the efficient level.
2.2. Third-Party Intervention. Our goal is to understand if contracting outcomes can be improved by the involvement of a third party from the community,
especially if the contracting parties are socially distant. There are two natural roles
that a third party can play: one of monitoring or reputation and one of punishment
or enforcement. A third party can observe (mis)-behavior on the part of one of the
two vested parties and can therefore pass information to others in the community.9
These others, or even the third party herself, may in the future interact with R.
In this way R’s behavior in the S-R interaction might shape the outcome of subsequent interactions with others through a reputational channel. Note that this sort
of reputational punishment of R by the third party is usually not verifiable outside
of the game as the third party cannot commit to passing specific messages to others.
Ultimately, we are precisely interested in this monitoring channel as it mimics the
sort of interaction that happens in these communities day-to-day.
Beyond a monitoring effect, there might also be an enforcement effect. It some
cases, the third party may be endowed with a direct and verifiable punitive mechanism (e.g., levying a fine) that can be exacted on a wrong-doing party. Moreover, we
note that it may be that not everyone is equally well-equipped to wield the punishment. For example, some individuals may be better suited to withstand retaliation
by the punished party. Similarly, some may be viewed as being more fair or possessing the authority to punish others. We should note that employing a third-party
punisher induces both monitoring and enforcement of the two-party exchange.
Our experimental design is structured to disentangle mechanisms of reputation
from mechanisms of enforcement. We ask both if reputation and enforcement can
(separately) improve outcomes, and if it matters who is given the role of monitor
or punisher. Participants play two different games with third-party involvement.
Again, for these games, the three players are randomly selected and given roles of S,
R, and T. S and R then make the same transfer decisions as in T1. In the reputation
variant (T2), we assign an individual T to watch the play of S and R but do not

our setting, such information transmission would occur outside of the experimental sessions.

allow her to take any actions within the game. In the enforcement variant (T3), we
assign and individual T to watch the play of S and R and also allow her to take a
costly punitive action in a third stage of the game. Specifically, T has the option
to spend his or her own resources to levy a monetary punishment on R. For every
Rs. 1 spent by T, R loses Rs. 4.10 In both T2 and T3, the third party is given an
endowment of Rs. 100.11
Comparing T2 to T1 allows us to capture the monitoring or reputational effect,
while comparing T3 to T2 isolates the enforcement effect. We can also examine heterogeneous effects of adding monitors or punishers of different types to the baseline
game.
2.3. Social Structures.
Network Centrality. A village social network is a description of interactions that
tend to occur between households. These interactions can arise for myriad purposes
– leisure, financial transactions, informational exchange, etc. – and can depend
on invariant features such as caste and geography. Importantly, the patterns of
interaction are not transient and represent a deep and persistent structure of exchange. In the experiment that follows, we want to know whether individuals who
are important in a network sense –who tend to be highly interactive or from whom
information tends to flow – will serve as efficiency-enhancing third parties.
We focus on eigenvector centrality, which measures how well an individual is
able to spread and collect information through the social network.12 Eigenvector
centrality is a recursive measure of importance wherein an individual’s centrality is
proportional to the sum of each of her neighbor’s centralities.13
Eigenvector centrality is relevant to our setting because it tells us which individuals are better suited to pass information about what happened in the game and
which individuals are more likely to be relevant in future encounters. It also captures an individual’s ability to exert social influence both within and outside of the
game. A very simple framework from Banerjee et al. (2013) explains the relevance
of this measure in our setting. Nonetheless, we do not mean to suggest that other
notions of centrality are irrelevant.
10We

did not vary experimentally the Rs. 4 punishment cost, and we do not claim that this
is the efficiency-maximizing punishment technology. We leave the determination of the optimal
punishment function for future work.
11We also attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to implement a fourth treatment involving having
(S, R) pairs interact in anticipation of a T who is not from their village by using a cellular phone.
12
See Appendix B for more discussion about this and related measures.
13
Empirical network papers employing eigenvector centrality include Hochberg et al. (2007), Banerjee et al. (2013), and Schechter et al. (2011).

Consider a simple process where every individual interacts with her neighbor in
a network (given by adjacency matrix A, where Aij ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether i
and j are linked or not) with probability p. This means that a piece of information
from i to neighbor j travels with probability p, or that i may go to j’s house with
probability p. This process repeats itself for T periods. Then the expected number
of times that information goes from i to all other nodes (or similarly the expected
number of times i visits all other nodes) is given by
DC (p, T ) :=

T
X

(pA)t · 1.

t=1

This measure is called diffusion centrality, and an entry DCi represents the expected
number of times that i has informed (or visited) all others. Banerjee et al. (2014)
1
show that as T → ∞ if p ≥ λ1 (A)
, diffusion centrality converges to eigenvector
centrality.
Because a central monitor is well-suited to pass information, any monitoring effect
should be more powerful when the third party is central, rather than peripheral. This
may provide incentives for the receivers to return more and for the senders, in turn,
to send more. Similarly, the likelihood of any sender or receiver interacting with the
third party in the future is higher if the third party is central, potentially providing
incentives for building reputation with the third party. Both of these mechanisms
are present in our experimental treatment with a third-party monitor.
In the cases with third-party punishment, centrality may permit for greater independence for the punisher. For example, the costs outside the game of punishing the
receiver may be especially high for punishers of low centrality; receivers could more
easily retaliate against these types of punishers. Similarly, members of society may
only grant the authority to punish to important enough members of the community.
Our design allows us to ask if randomly giving a punishment tool to a thirdparty monitor improves outcomes, and if this improvement is differential across
central and peripheral third parties. If the monitor channel improves transfers, we
predict that a more central monitor will generate more efficiency, and similarly, if
the enforcement channel improves transfers, we predict that a more central punisher
will be associated with more efficiency.

Other Types of Hierarchical Authority. We also consider the interactions of alternative types of social importance with the play of the game. In our data, we observe

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

10

measures of caste status, elite status, and gender, each of which has been examined previously in the literature in other contexts. These characteristics might also
correlate with third-party efficacy.14
Low caste status indicates that an individual belongs to a scheduled caste or
tribe. Historically, these groups were disadvantaged in their access to education and
employment opportunities (Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2006) and were limited in their
economic and social mobility. Accordingly, one might expect high caste individuals
to be viewed as more important decision-makers in the village, and they may be
more immune to retaliation than members of the lower castes. Some laboratory
evidence also suggests that low caste compared to high caste individuals punish
norm violations less often and less severely (Hoff et al. 2008, 2011).
Those we term as elites in our setting include gram panchayat members, anganwadi teachers, etc. Gram panchayat members are individuals with great social and
political power. While ex ante powerful individuals may be more likely to reach
these positions, the roles themselves may also generate influence. School teachers
and headmasters are also widely known and respected for the role they play in the
education of the village and are often informed of new government programs for
children and families before any other individuals. Local elites, many of whom are
already endowed with formal authority might be well-suited to serve as arbiters.
However, leaders may also be prone to elite capture and may be more sensitive to
retaliation by their constituents (Ball et al. 2001; Abrams et al. 2012; von Essen
and Ranehillii 2012).
Finally, we can also explore if the gender of the third party matters for punisher
efficacy. India is one of the countries with the lowest sex ratios in the world (Sen
1992) and has recently implemented policies of reservation for women to correct for
historical discrimination (Beaman et al. 2009). As such, we may expect that women
might be less respected as third parties, especially when they have the ability to
punish. We explore whether all these alternative types of social importance also
make effectual monitors and punishers.

3. Data
3.1. Network Data. We chose our sample frame from villages where we have access
to village census demographics as well as unique social network data, previously
collected in part by the authors. In our data, we have a census of every individual in
14It

is also possible that each of these characteristics is correlated with network position. We
explore these correlations in Section 3.4.

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

11

every village and we have network data collected across the following 12 dimensions:
“(1) those who visit the respondents’ home, (2) those whose homes the respondent
visits, (3) kin in the village, (4) non-relatives with whom the respondent socializes,
(5) those from whom the respondent receives medical advice, (6) those from whom
the respondent would borrow money, (7) those to whom the respondent would lend
money, (8) those from whom the respondent would borrow material goods (kerosene,
rice, etc.), (9) those to whom the respondent would lend material goods, (10) those
from whom the respondent gets advice, (11) those to whom the respondent gives
advice, and (12) those whom the respondent goes to pray with (at a temple, church,
or mosque)” (Banerjee et al., 2013). 46% of households were administered the
network survey module, and households could name as many responses per question
as they wanted and name as many individuals from their village in response to
the questions. As such, we have extremely detailed data on social linkages, not
only between our experimental participants but also about the embedding of the
individuals in the social fabric at large, across many networks. This level of detail
across so many independent networks is atypical.
To construct our network A, we build an undirected, unweighted graph taking the
union over the twelve dimensions, and we construct the network at the household
level. This is consistent with the Banerjee et al. (2013) and Chandrasekhar et al.
(2013) treatment of the data, and that work has a lengthier discussion on this
decision. That is, any two households are linked if any member has any relationship
with anyone else. This is reasonable as, in our villages, the multiple dimensions are
highly correlated so the union network ensures that we take into account any possible
meaningful relationship, without constructing an ad hoc weighting procedure. Going
forward, we use this A to represent the network of the village and we construct
distances between nodes and centralities of nodes accordingly.
3.2. Recruitment and Implementation. To recruit participants in each village,
we randomly chose a subset of approximately 15 households to invite to participate.
This randomization ensured that the villagers perceived our recruitment to be fair.
We visited all invited households two days before the experimental sessions and
informed them about the opportunity to participate. We then told them the location
and the starting time of the games and guaranteed that they would have priority
to participate. When we arrived in the villages at the specified time, in most cases
many individuals both invitees and non-invitees were already waiting for us. Before
registering the participants, we also walked through the village to remind households
to participate.

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

12

Once registered for participation, each participant played five to six total rounds
of three experimental treatments. During each round, players were randomly assigned to one of the three roles: sender (S) with endowment Rs. 60, receiver (R)
with endowment Rs. 60, and third party (T ) with endowment Rs. 100. A total of
14 surveyors moderated the experiments, each overseeing only one group of participants at a time. Surveyors were randomly assigned to different groups and thus
their presence should be orthogonal to the treatments and the characteristics of the
participants. Additionally, while there might be the concern that surveyors also
play the role of monitors, they had no ties in the villages where we conducted our
experiments and were prohibited from commenting on the behavior they observed
during the experiments to other villagers. Further, they were present for all three
treatments. Any cross-treatment or heterogeneous effects we measure are therefore
net of any effects from the surveyor’s presence.
Individuals played the different games in random order.15 We also ensured that no
two individuals played any game with one another more than once. This restriction
limited the number of rounds we could play with the participants from each village.
Participant played two rounds of each of T2 and T3. Half of participants played
one round of T1, while the other half played two rounds. After playing all of the
rounds, participants were each given their ending wealth values for one randomlychosen game plus a fixed participation fee of Rs. 20. The average payoff was approximately Rs. 110, or approximately three-fourths of a daily agricultural wage. We
stress that these are extremely large stakes – nearly a day’s wage for an experiment
lasting no more than an hour.16
3.3. Outcomes. In our analysis, we focus on the initial transfer made by the sender
to the receiver as our key outcome. This transfer level encodes efficiency because it
is one-to-one with the entire size of the pie that the receiver then chooses how to
allocate. Before analyzing the treatment effects and network effects, it is helpful to
first observe the overall outcomes from the experimental sessions. The data include

weeks, this would scale to stakes of $144 for participating in the experiment.

Moving to the receiver’s response, Figure 2 shows the pooled distribution of transfers from R to S as a fraction of the initial transfer from S to R. Note that most
of the receivers transfer weakly less than the amount sent by the sender, leaving
receivers with quantities at least as high as their initial endowments.18 Only 5% of
games ended with the receiver sending more back to the sender than was initially
transferred. Note that while, on average, both S and R gain relative to their initial
endowments, approximately 25% of senders are worse off in monetary terms than if
they had played the static Nash Equilibrium.
These outcomes show that while players in the role of S tend to transfer amounts
substantially greater than zero, most games are quite far from the efficient outcome.
Further, sender transfers are quite heterogeneous. We next move to understand the
extent to which the contracting structure and the social network can help (S, R)
pairs to achieve more efficient outcomes.

3.4. Sample Statistics. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics. Our analysis
sample includes 930 participants from 1888 two- and three-party game observations.
59% of the participants are female, and the average education level is 8.15 years of
schooling with a standard deviation of 4.32.19 About 67% of the participants are
general or “otherwise backwards” (OBC) caste.20 Finally, 20% of households have
a leader or local elite.
Turning to network characteristics, 96.5% of paris are reachable (there exists a
path through the network connecting the two).21 Between the reachable pairs, the
maximum social distance is 8, while the average social distance is approximately
3.5.22 The average eigenvector centrality is 0.02 with a standard deviation of 0.04,
indicating that there is substantial heterogeneity in an individual’s social importance.
Finally, we explore the relationship between the network characteristics and demographic covariates. To do this, in Table 2 we present a correlation matrix of
several network and demographic covariates, as well as a principal component matrix. While the various functions of eigenvector centrality are highly correlated

means that on average, an individual had attended 8th standard.
20There are three standard caste categories in India: general merit (GM); scheduled caste and
scheduled tribe (SCST); and other backward caste (OBC). The SCST group is traditionally the
most disadvantaged. Our indicator for “high caste” groups the GM and OBC designations.
21We condition our sample on this set of reachable pairs for all of the analysis.

(mechanically, so),23 and while there is non-zero correlation between network centrality and other physical covariates (e.g., wealth, elite status, caste), the correlation
is not very high. This is interesting in that it provides some suggestive evidence as
to why, even when conditioning on treatment-physical covariates interactions in regressions, our network-based results remain extremely robust. This bolsters the idea
that the topological features of the network are instrumental in the results that we
are describing.
Similarly, in Table 3, we present the first three vectors of a principal component
decomposition of the importance characteristics. The decomposition contains six
different measures of importance: eigenvector centrality, elite status, high caste,
wealth, educational attainment, and gender. The five variables separate along three
distinct dimensions. Eigenvector centrality is the main constituent of the first principal component, caste, wealth and education are all key contributors to the second
principal component, and elite status and gender appear in the third principal component. This suggests that network centrality does have content distinct from the
other demographic characteristics.

4. Empirical Strategy
We are interested in examining how the efficiency of a session, as measured by the
sender’s transfer τS , responds to whether there is a third party, whether the third
party has access to a punishment technology and how these answers depend on the
centrality of the third party in the network,
Specifically, our analysis uses regressions of the following form:
(4.1)

τS,rgjv = α + βT 2 · 1{g=T 2} + γT 2 · 1{g=T 2} · eT,jgv
+βT 3 · 1{g=T 3} + γT 3 · 1{g=T 3} · eT,jgv
+δT0 2 Wjgv · 1{g=T 2} + δT0 3 Wjgv · 1{g=T 3}
+η 0 Xjgv + µr + µvg + rgv .

Here r is round, j is the triple of players (SRT ), g is game, and v is village. eT,jgv
is the eigenvector centrality of the third party Tj , and Wj is a triple of leadership
status, caste, and gender of Tj . Finally, Xj is a vector of other demographics and
network controls for all parties (e.g., centrality, leadership status, caste and gender
of S and R, social closeness between all pairs [see Appendix B], wealth of all three

rankings of wealth and centrality are constructed using within-village rankings.

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

15

parties, and education of all three parties, as well as interactions of each of the
aforementioned variables with game dummies), µr is a round fixed effect, and µvg is
a village-experimental session fixed effect.
We are particularly interested in γT 2 and γT 3 . Observe that γT 2 measures the effect
of an increase in centrality on efficiency through the monitoring channel. γT 3 − γT 2
measures the relative return to centrality of T through the enforcement channel (net
of the monitoring channel). Central questions are whether γT 2 ≥ 0 and γT 3 > γT 2 .
Similarly, turning to the question of whether leaders, high caste member, or females make relatively better third-party institutions, we are interested in parameter
vectors δT 2 and δT 3 . These capture whether leaders, high caste members or females
generate efficiency as third-party institutions and whether this effect comes from a
monitoring channel, an enforcement channel or both.
Observe that we are chiefly interested in heterogeneous treatment effects based
on network position and in cross-treatment heterogeneous network effects. While
these parameters are identified given our randomized experimental design, we do
acknowledge that the networks themselves are not randomly assigned. People who
are central might differ from people who are peripheral on numerous dimensions.
In the analysis, we are both able to ask if other demographic measures of social
importance can replicate the centrality results and to control for all available demographic characteristics in our main regression specification. If we find (which we do)
that among all observable characteristics only network-central punishers improve
efficiency, then we can be confident that for institutional design purposes, we should
target high centrality individuals when building informal enforcement mechanisms.
5. Results
5.1. Network centrality. We now address the central theme of our paper: how
does introducing a third-party institution influence the efficiency of outcomes? Do
more central third parties generate more efficiency and, if so, how much can be
attributed to an enforcement channel as compared to a monitoring channel?
Table 4 presents our main results – the specification described in (4.1). Columns
1-4 use two different versions of our centrality measure. Columns 1-2 present the
results using centrality percentile, while columns 3-4 use an indicator for whether
the third party is above the 50th percentile of centrality in the sample distribution.
Finally, in columns 1 and 3 we do not use demographic-by-treatment controls, which
we introduce in columns 2 and 4.
First, in column 2 we see that being randomly assigned a third party in the
monitoring treatment who is at the 75th percentile of the centrality distribution as

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

16

compared to the 25th percentile corresponds to a Rs. 2.58 increase (9% relative
to the mean). This means that there is a modest efficiency gain simply from the
monitoring channel.
Second, we turn to the enforcement channel. Being randomly assigned a third
party at the 75th percentile instead of the 25th percentile of the centrality distribution corresponds to an additional Rs. 3.4 (12% relative to the mean) increase in
transfers (column 4). In sum, having a third party who can punish who is at the
top of the inter-quartile range of the centrality distribution increases transfers by
about 21% relative to the mean, and nearly 3/5 of the effect is coming from the
enforcement channel.
It is important to note that these are effects that are conditional on demographic
and other social network controls interacted with treatment. This is our preferred
specification since it directly controls for confounds such as leadership, caste, gender,
wealth, age, education of all parties, sender and receiver centrality, and social closeness between all parties with treatment-varying effects.24 Columns 1 and 3 show
the same regression results without demographic controls as well. We find that the
results for the enforcement channel are remarkably robust. However, removing the
controls generates considerable noise in the estimates of the monitoring channel in
column 1, and we are unable to reject zero effect in that specification. In each of
the four specifications, the effect of being paired with a highly central third party
is greater in magnitude in the enforcement + monitoring treatment (T3) than in
the game with monitoring alone (T2). The difference in these effects is statistically
significant at standard levels in three of the four specifications.
Taken together we find extremely stable and robust evidence that there is a large
enforcement channel through which network centrality is associated with efficient
outcomes. While we do find a modest effect size for the monitoring channel as
well, this result is more sensitive to the inclusion of controls. Ultimately, by randomly grouping individuals and randomly varying the institutional setup (designed
to parse the monitoring channel from the enforcement channel) while controlling for
demographic-by-treatment covariates, we are able to take a reasonable measurement
of how network centrality of a third party influences efficiency and to decompose it
along monitoring and enforcement channels.
5.2. Leadership, caste and gender. Because the social networks in these 40
study villages are not randomly assigned, it is natural to ask whether our network
effects are driven by other demographic characteristics that happen to be correlated
24The

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

17

with network position. Additionally, understanding whether elite status, caste or
gender status influences the effectiveness of a third party is interesting in its own
right. Thus, our main specification includes demographic-by-treatment regressors,
which allow us to control for these effects when looking at centrality effects but
whose point estimates are themselves important.
As noted in Table 4, demographic variables tend to be much more correlated with
other demographic variables and less with network variables. Similarly, when looking at the principal component analysis in Table 3, we observe that demographic
and network characteristics pick up different dimensions of variance in a principal
component analysis. This provides a priori evidence that it is likely that network
variables are likely not going to merely proxy for other standard demographic features.
Turning to the effect of these demographic variables in their own right, we see
that none of elite, caste nor gender replicates the patterns observed with the network
characteristics. Specifically, there is no detectable effect of any of these demographic
features either through the monitoring channel or through the enforcement channel,
unlike the case of network centrality.
Finally, in Appendix Table A.1, we present results demographic variable by demographic variable (neither conditioning on each other nor on network centrality). We
find that even in these cases, there is no association between elite, caste or gender
status of the third party on the sender’s transfer. This again confirms that none
of the demographic importance measures is able to replicate the effects of being
assigned to a network-central third party. This also implies that when trying to design informal enforcement institutions, it is not enough to try to select individuals
to play the role of arbiter based on their demographic characteristics alone.

5.3. Institutional design. A prediction of our framework is that the third party
should have the most scope to help precisely when senders and receivers cannot
autonomously engage in efficient behavior. This is what we examine below. The
following exercise serves two purposes. First, it functions as an over-identification
test: it tells us where to look for another effect consistent with our story. Second, it
allows us to address institutional design questions. Are third-party institutions only
relevant and/or influential when contracting parties are socially distant and when
the third party is more central? The latter point is particularly important as we
show in Appendix Table A.2, that on average introducing a third-party monitor or
punisher has no net effects. Despite having no mean effects, the third party may be

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

18

particularly beneficial, as suspected, exactly when S and R are unable to maintain
efficient levels on their own without commitment contracts.
Figure 3 illustrates this graphically, plotting sender transfers25 for 10 different
game configurations. Panel A includes two-party games (left-most in each grouping) and three-party games with monitors. Panel B includes the same two-party
games (left-most in each grouping) alongside results from the games with punishers.
We further consider cases where S and R are of close social proximity (left groupings) versus far social proximity (right groupings) and cases where the third-party
punisher is of high centrality (middle bar in each grouping) versus low centrality
(right-most bar in each grouping).26 The bar charts illustrate many of our key
networks results but also allow for comparisons between the three- and two-party
games.
The bar charts reinforce the result that in the two-party game, outcomes are
better when the sender and the receiver are socially close. Another striking pattern
is that the identity of the punisher is extremely important when S and R are socially
far. In these cases, when the punisher is peripheral in the network, sender transfers
are considerably lower (11.9% relative to the mean) than the two-party outcome.
However, when the punisher is central in the network, transfers are 9.1% higher
(relative to the mean) than the two-party outcome. Moreover, this level of transfer
is comparable to (and not statistically distinguishable from) the two-party outcome
when the sender and receiver are socially close. We observe a similar, yet weaker
pattern when S and R are far, and when there is a central vs. peripheral third-party
monitor. Finally, because socially close S and R experience larger transfers in the
absence of third-party enforcement, there is both less scope for a third party to
improve but also more scope for it to crowd out efficiency. Consistent with Fehr
and Gächter (2002), we observe that the extrinsic incentives introduced only by the
third-party punisher but not the monitor crowd out transfers when S and R are
socially close.

say that S and R are close if their distance is at most two, and we say T is of high centrality
if she has above-median eigenvector centrality among the individuals playing from her own village.

We now do this exercise formally, conditioning on various fixed effects and demographicby-treatment controls as in (4.1). We use regressions of the form:
(5.1)

τS,rgjv = α + βT 2 · 1{g=T 2} + φT 2 · 1{g=T 2} · eT,jgv
+θT 2 · 1{g=T 2} · eT,jgv · Closeness(S, R)jgv
+βT 3 · 1{g=T 3} + φT 3 · 1{g=T 3} · eT,jgv
+θT 3 · 1{g=T 3} · eT,jgv · Closeness(S, R)jgv
+δT0 2 Wjgv · 1{g=T 2} + δT0 3 Wjgv · 1{g=T 3}
+η 0 Xjgv + µr + µvg + rgv .

Closeness(S, R)jgv is a number describing how socially proximate S and R are.
Specifically, it is defined as maxi0 ,j 0 d (i0 , j 0 )−d (S, R). Thus, a value of zero indicates
minimal closeness (maximal distance) and maximal closeness is simply maxi0 ,j 0 d (i0 , j 0 )−
1. This is useful because φT 2 and φT 3 therefore encode how the centrality of the
third party differentially influences efficiency when S and R are furthest away. Xj
is as in (4.1), so recall that it includes interactions of Closeness(S, R) with game
dummies (and in fact all pairs of social closeness interacted with game dummies).
Table 5 presents the results. In Columns 1-2 we show results for centrality quantile, and columns 3-4 display a dummy for whether the third party is above the
median centrality quantile. Columns 1 and 3 do not condition on demographic-bytreatment controls whereas columns 2 and 4 do.
We find that for the furthest individuals, going from the 25th to the 75th percentile
in centrality of the third party with punishment corresponded to an increase of
sender transfers of Rs. 17.6 (a 62% increase relative to the mean). However, S and
R being closer by two steps (e.g., distance 2 instead of distance 4) corresponds to
the third-party punisher’s centrality being less valuable: the inter-quartile effect is
now only an increase of 12.33 (a 43.4% increase relative to the mean). It is worth
noting that we have very little power in this specification since we are looking at a
triple interaction, and so decomposing the effects into enforcement versus monitoring
channels becomes difficult. While we are unable to reject that there is no monitoring
effect due to considerable noise, we can only separate the effect of enforcement
from the (noisily estimated) effect of monitoring in the specifications with the full
demographic controls. (columns 2 and 4)
The exercise here provides evidence supporting the idea that when the contracting parties are socially close, they can sustain reasonably good outcomes without
outside intervention. However, when the contracting parties are socially distant,

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

20

third parties who have the ability to take punitive actions may improve outcomes,
so long as that individual is chosen carefully. In our setting, the best outcomes
with socially far contracting pairs occur when the individual with the punishment
technology is socially important.

6. Conclusion
A large literature highlights the fact that agents can maintain efficient transactions
with those with whom they are socially close despite a lack of formal institutions.
Thus, a crucial question is how to develop informal institutions that can improve
efficiency even for distant contracting pairs. Namely, who in the social network can
intervene to help facilitate trade, and which tools should that individual be given?
Using a lab-in-the-field design across 40 villages where we have detailed network
data, we identify that the centrality of the third party greatly affects the efficiency
of a sender-receiver interaction in a simple investment game. Additionally, by comparing a treatment where the third party simply observes the interaction with one
where the third party can additionally punish the receiver, we distinguish between
a pure monitoring channel and an enforcement channel.
We find that while both mechanisms are at play, the enforcement channel is
robustly larger than the monitoring channel. This suggests that not all individuals
are equally well-equipped to take on the role of a punisher. For instance, a less
central individual may face retaliation outside of the dispute arbitration in a way
that a more central individual need not worry about.
Further, our results are consistent with the motivating idea that external institutions are only necessary when repeated game dynamics or social preferences aren’t
enough to generate cooperation. The introduction of a central third party does little
relative to the two-party game outcome when the sender and receiver are socially
close. However, when the pair is distant, they have considerably less scope for cooperation and it is precisely in this situation where having a central third party truly
pays off.
Our results present a lower bound on the potential for a carefully chosen individual
to help, as we did not optimize the choice of the cost per unit punishment and did
not vary experimentally the type of enforcement technology given to the third party.
While on average introducing a third-party monitor or punisher has no net effects
on efficiency, as Appendix Table A.2 indicates, this could simply be an artifact
of the lack of optimality of our punishment technology. Clearly, one could think
about constructing an optimal punishment technology that would yield weakly larger

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

21

transfers than the ones presented here. However, this is beyond the scope of this
paper and is left to future research.
Finally, for policy what is important is identifying the “right” individual in the
community. We have shown that observable characteristics such as elite status,
caste, and gender are not particularly good predictors of who makes for an effective
monitor or judge. It is only the network centrality that is a good predictor of
monitor or punisher success. This means that simply relying on demographic and
occupational traits to build an effective informal institution may fall short.

Appendix B. Glossary of Network Statistics
In this section we briefly discuss the network statistics used in the paper. Jackson
(2008) contains an extensive discussion of these concepts.
Path Length and Social Closeness. The path length between nodes i and j is
the length of the shortest
walk between the two nodes. Denoted γ(i, j), it is defined
è é
k
as γ(i, j) := mink∈N∪∞ A
> 0. If there is no such walk, notice that γ(i, j) = ∞,
ij
though in our analysis we focus on the giant component of the graph. The social
closeness between i and j is defined as maxi′ ,j ′ d (i′ , j ′ ) − d (i, j). This defines a
measure of how close the two nodes are with 0 meaning that the path is of maximal
length and maxi′ ,j ′ d (i′ , j ′ ) − 1 meaning that they share an edge. In figure B.1,
γ(i, j) = 2 and γ(i, k) = ∞.

Vertex characteristics. For completeness we discuss three basic notions of network importance from graph theory: degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector
centrality. The degree of node i is the number of links that the node has. In figure
B(a), i has degree 6 while in (b) i has degree 2. While this is an intuitive notion of
importance, it misses a key feature that a node’s ability to propagate information
depends not only on the sheer number of connections it has, but also how important
those connections are. Figure B(b) illustrates an example where it is clear that i
is a very important node, but a simple count of friends does not reflect it. Both
betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality address this problem.
The betweenness centrality of i is defined as the share of all shortest paths between
all other nodes j, k Ó= i which pass through i.
The eigenvector centrality of i is a recursive measure of network importance.
Formally, it is defined as the ith component of the eigenvector corresponding to the

SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

maximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix representing the graph.27 Intuitively,
this measure defines the importance of a node as proportional to the sum over each of
its network neighbors’ importances. By definition the vector of these importances
must be an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix, and restricting the importance
measure to be positive means that the vector of importances must be the first
eigenvector. This measure captures how well information flows through a particular
node in a transmission process. Relative to betweenness, a much lower premium is
placed on a node being on the exact shortest path between two other nodes. We
can see this by comparing figure B(b), where i has a high eigenvector centrality and
high betweenness, to (c), where i still has a rather high eigenvector centrality but
now has a 0 betweenness centrality since no shortest path passes through i.

adjacency matrix A of an undirected, unweighted graph G is a symmetric matrix of 0s and
