JEL No. I10, I12
ABSTRACT

The increased prevalence of obesity in the United States stresses the pressing need for answers as
to why this rapid rise has occurred. This paper employs micro-level data from the First, Second,
and Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to determine the effects that
various state-level variables have on body mass index and obesity. These variables, which
include the per capita number of restaurants, the gasoline tax, the cigarette tax, and clean indoor
air laws, display many of the expected effects on obesity and explain a substantial amount of its
trend. These findings control for individual-level measures of household income, years of formal
schooling completed, and marital status.

“The drudgery of seeking subsistence has been supplanted for millions of people, not by abundance and
indulgence, but rather by a new concept of what are necessities and needs.”
– George Katona, The Mass Consumption Society (1964, p.6)
I. Introduction
The New York Times recently featured in its Book Review a book by Greg Critser entitled How
Americans Became the Fattest People in the World, further shedding light on the obesity epidemic that
has been prominently featured in the media. While obesity is not a new problem, it has recently surged
into public consciousness. For most individuals, overweight and obesity result from a combination of
excess caloric intake and inactivity (Koplan and Dietz 1999; Public Health Service 2001). The majority
of Americans are now overweight (Must et al. 1999; Flegal et al. 2002). According to the USDA,
Americans consumed 2,002 calories per day in 1994-1996, as opposed to 1,854 in 1977-1978 (Frazao
1999). While rates of overweight and obesity had remained steady until about 1980, since then
overweight and obesity in the United States have escalated dramatically. This is an indication that
genetics may not play such a large role in obesity, as genetic change does not occur so rapidly over time.
According to Koplan and Dietz (1999), the gene pool in the US has not changed significantly between
1980 and 1994. A study using twins has indicated that perhaps there is a much larger environmental
effect in determining body weight than previously believed (Segal and Allison 2002).
Second only to tobacco as the leading cause of premature death (McGinnis 1993), obesity and
sedentary lifestyle are rapidly becoming the first. Obesity and sedentary lifestyles accounted for
approximately 400,000 deaths in 2000, compared to 435,000 from cigarette smoking, 100,000 from
alcohol abuse, and 20,000 from illegal drug use. They are related to such illnesses as coronary heart
disease, stroke, high blood pressure, cancers of the colon, breast and prostate, and diabetes (Must et al.
1999; Mokdad et al. 2003). Obesity has also been associated with high cholesterol, menstrual
irregularities, pregnancy complications, and psychological disorders such as depression (NIDDKD 1996).
Known to many as adult-onset diabetes, type 2 diabetes is now not uncommon among children as a result
of the obesity epidemic (Freedman et al. 1999). Obesity in adulthood has been shown to reduce life
expectancy, most notably at younger ages (Peeters et al. 2003; Fontaine et al. 2003).

This paper investigates the idea that the recent rapid increase in obesity rates are due to economic
changes that have in turn caused behavioral changes in the lives of Americans. These changes in the
environment have changed habits and redefined social and cultural norms. Changes in the surrounding
environment have been numerous. The per capita number of restaurants increased by 61 percent between
1972 and 1997 (see Figure 1). Since more women are in the labor force today than in the 1970s, eating
out has become more common as families are encouraged to purchase food away from home.1 Figure 2
shows the trend in female labor force participation in the US from 1970 to 2000. In 1971, 43 percent of
women were in the labor force, a figure which increased to almost 60 percent by 1994. Technological
changes have made for an easier lifestyle, and thus less physical activity is embedded into daily activities.
Jobs have become more sedentary, contributing to the lack of physical activity that many experience.
Many must now stray from their daily routines and pay for gym memberships in order to be more
physically active.
To study the determinants of body mass index and obesity, we employ pooled micro-level data
from the First, Second, and Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. These data,
described later in full, are what the Centers for Disease Control use to track changes in obesity over time,
as they contain measures of weight and height based on actual physical examinations. We augment these
data using state-level policy variables pertaining to the per capita number of restaurants, the gasoline tax,
the cigarette tax, and clean indoor air laws. We find that the increase in the per capita number of
restaurants in particular increases obesity, and that female body mass index is responsive to changes in
the cigarette tax.
II. Background and Literature Review

1

While Cutler et al. (2003) say that the shift to more households with women working accounts for a mere ten
percent of the increase in obesity, there is an additional indirect effect on other households through cultural changes
via externalities. Using international cross-sectional data from 22 OECD countries, they find no effect of the
percentage of females in the labor force on obesity.

The prevalence of morbid obesity, the most severe form of obesity defined by a body mass index of 40
kg/m2 or higher, increased from 0.78% in 1990 to 2.2% in 2000 (Freedman et al. 2002).2 The body mass
index (BMI) is the most convenient measure available in assessing overweight and obesity, its limitations
being that it might overestimate body fat in athletes who have a muscular build and underestimate body
fat in older people who have lost muscle mass (NIDDKD 1996).3 Table 1 shows how average BMI and
the percentage obese have changed over time in the four NHANES data sets.4 The change between
NHANES II and NHANES III is most notable, where a 57% increase occurs in the percentage of people
who are obese. Average BMI goes up by 1.28 kg/m2, or 5.1%, from 25.07 kg/m2 to 26.35 kg/m2. Table 2
shows differences across gender. This shows a 127% increase in the percentage of obese males between
NHANES I and NHANES 99, and a 106% increase for females. The percentage of obese females,
however, has remained consistently higher than the percentage of obese males.
Part of the tremendous increase in the obesity rate over time has been attributed to reductions in
job strenuousness (Philipson 2001; Lakdawalla and Philipson 2002). Lakdawalla and Philipson use the
National Health Interview Survey (1976-1994) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (19821998) to show that decreases in job strenuousness over a long period of time are mainly responsible for
increases in BMI over time. However, job strenuousness was relatively stable between the NHANES II
and NHANES III time periods. The authors explain the rapid increase in the last two decades with
changes in food prices. One disadvantage is that they are forced to use self-reported measures of weight
and height rather than actual measures, yet they do attempt to correct for this.5 Philipson (2001) points

2

This estimate is based on self-reported measures from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
Waist circumference might be an alternate measure of obesity, as a waist circumference of over 35 inches for
women and 40 inches for men has been associated with a markedly increased likelihood of a variety of diseases
(Janssen et al. 2002). However, waist circumference is not commonly measured in national public health data sets,
and only NHANES III measures waist circumference.
4
We do not use the most recent NHANES data in our analysis as the most current data available for the number of
restaurants from the Census of Retail Trade is in 1997.
5
This method uses NHANES data, which contains both self-reported and actual measures of height and weight, and
obtains age-gender-race-specific corrections. This is done by regressing the actual measure on the self-reported
measure and its square and using the coefficient to adjust the self-reported measures in the data set being used. This
is also the method used by Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (2004) in their study using the BRFSS. Yet there have been
arguments that even this correction does not completely eliminate error and is not a perfect substitute for actual
measures (see, for example, Plankey et al. 1997).

out that the American society has shifted from an agricultural one to a post-industrial one. This shift has
been accompanied by innovations that economize on time spent in the household sector, such as
convenience food for consumption. An increase in the variety of the food supply may contribute to the
maintenance of obesity (Raynor and Epstein 2001).
Cawley (1999) has presented evidence suggesting that caloric intake is addictive. This is in line
with findings that high-density fast food might indeed be addictive (Naik and Moore 1996; Schlosser
2001). Fat consumption in the US has increased (Ippolito and Mathios 1995; Frazao 1999). Evidence has
also been put forth suggesting that obesity is associated with lower wages for women (Averett and
Korenman 1996; Cawley 2004). The negative externalities that obese people impose on others has also
been considered (Keeler et al. 1989).6
Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (2002, 2004) employ micro-level data from the 1984-1999
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to show the determinants of body mass index and obesity.
They find large positive elasticities associated with the per capita number of restaurants, and at the same
time, direct positive effects of labor market attachment on obesity. They theorize that perhaps labor
market attachment has indirect effects on obesity that operate through restaurant availability. Ewing et al.
(2003) have attributed part of the increase in obesity to the degree of urban sprawl. Urban sprawl
measures the process through which the spread of development across the landscape outpaces population
growth. Using a more comprehensive measure of urban sprawl, Smart Growth America has calculated a
reliable measure of how conducive a city is to exercise. Those urban areas that offer more transportation
choices, are more compact, and have a variety of stores and activity centers within reach have lower rates
of obesity.
Global comparisons can be seen in Cutler et al. (2003), highlighting the leading role that the
United States plays in the obesity epidemic. They stress a theory of increased obesity based on the
division of labor in food preparation and thus reductions in the time cost of food. The mass preparation of

Grossman (2004).

food has allowed for the reduction of the marginal cost of preparing food by substituting capital for labor,
leading to repeated food consumption of greater variety. They postulate that fattening meals at fast food
restaurants have not made Americans obese as most of the increase in food consumption has been due to
increased snacking.7
The magnitude of the obesity epidemic begs the question as to why the increase has been so
rapid, as well as what policy changes might be done in order to reverse this trend. Part of this question
has been answered by previous research. This paper uses comprehensive data rich in covariates with
objective measures covering a long time period, 1971-1994. In addition, we consider gender groups
separately.
III. Empirical Methodology
A household utility function such as that outlined by Becker (1965) provides a useful framework for
assessing body mass index. While no one wishes to be obese, some people gain more utility out of
consuming food than others. People combine the obtaining of goods and services in the market with their
own time to achieve objects that enter their utility functions – such as health, entertainment, and the
enjoyment of eating palatable food.
In this paper we use the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which has an
advantage over other data sets in that it has actual measures of body mass index rather than self-reported
measures. We use pooled data from 1971 to 1994.
Obesity (O) is a function of caloric intake, caloric expenditure, smoking, and a vector of variables
that are specific to an individual and reflect that individual’s predisposition towards obesity. Demand
functions for caloric intake, caloric expenditure, and smoking are generated that depend on a set of
exogenous variables as follows:

O = O( R, t c , indoor , t g , E , A, G, S , H , M )

This conclusion was made using data from the Continuing Survey of Food Intake, and does not take into account
snacks purchased at restaurants and consumed at home.

In equation (1), R represents restaurants, tc is the cigarette tax, , indoor represents clean indoor air laws, tg
is the tax on gasoline, E represents ethnic and racial background, A is age, G is gender, S denotes years of
formal schooling completed, H is household income, and M represents marital status. We translate
equation (1) into an empirical one through the following equation:

O = α 0 + α1 R + α 2 R 2 + α 3t c + α 4 t c + α 5indoor + α 6 t g + α 7 t g + α 8black

Quadratic terms are included in equation (2) for the per capita number of restaurants, as well as for taxes,
income, and age. This is to account for the likelihood that an additional value at higher levels will have
less of an effect on the dependent variables as that of an additional value at lower levels.8 Black,
hispanic, and other are dummy variables for race and ethnicity; male is a dummy variable for whether or
not the respondent is male; elem, somehigh, high, somecoll, and college are dummy variables for years of
schooling completed; married, divorced, and widowed are dummy variables for marital status; years and
states represent indicators for year of survey and state of residence, respectively; α 24 and α 25 thus
represent vectors.
IV. Micro-Level Data
To investigate the determinants of body mass index and obesity, we employ micro-level data from the
First, Second, and Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES I, II, and III,
respectively). These are national samples of the population of the US ages 6 months to 74 years
(NHANES I and II), and ages 2 months and over (NHANES III) with some oversampling of preschool
children and the elderly in all three surveys; low-income families in NHANES I and II; women of
childbearing ages in NHANES I; and blacks and Mexican Americans in NHANES III. The oversampling
of low-income families in NHANES I and II results in the presence of more blacks in these surveys than

In preliminary regressions, we find evidence that these continuous variables – the only continuous variables on the
RHS with the exception of indoor, which takes on only four values, have non-linear effects.

7

in a random sample of the population of the US. Similarly, the oversampling of blacks and Mexican
Americans in NHANES III results in more low-income families than in a random sample. We focus in
this paper on all adults 17 years of age and older. All three surveys were conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); NHANES I was conducted between 1971 and 1975; NHANES II
was conducted between 1976 and 1980; and NHANES III was conducted between 1988 and 1994. Most
states of the US are represented in each survey.
V. Dependent Variables
Body mass index (BMI), also termed Quetelet’s index, is measured as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared, and is most commonly used in analyzing overweight and obesity. While there
are various guidelines for defining overweight and obesity, we adopt the convention outlined by the
National Institutes of Health in Clinical Guidelines (Public Health Service 2001). Following this method,
an adult that is overweight is one with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or higher, while one that is obese has a BMI of
30 kg/m2 or higher. Obesity characterized by a BMI between 30-34.9 is termed class 1 obesity, that
between 35-39.9 class 2 obesity, and that greater than 40 kg/m2 class 3 obesity, or morbid obesity. The
dependent variables that we use are body mass index and the probability of being obese, where an obese
respondent is one with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher.
VI. Independent Variables
The state-level variables included on the RHS of the equation pertain to the per capita number of
restaurants, the cigarette tax, clean indoor air laws, and the gasoline tax. Including more state-level
variables would cause the model to be plagued by multicollinearity. We must thus be partial to our
results and generalize our conclusions to include effects of state-level variables that might be highly
correlated with the ones that we include in our model.
The per capita state-level number of restaurants is taken from the Census of Retail Trade.
Frequency of fast food restaurant use has been shown to be associated with higher fat intake and greater
body weight (French et al. 2000; Rolls and Hammer 1995; Public Health Service 2001), as fast food
restaurants serve especially large portions (Nielsen and Popkin 2003). The Census of Retail Trade is part

8

of the Economic Census and is collected every five years. The data we use are from 1972, 1977, 1982,
1987, 1992, and 1997. Fast food restaurants correspond to the Census category refreshment places while
full service restaurants correspond to the Census category restaurants and lunchrooms. In 1997 this
classification system changed; refreshment places became limited service restaurants, and restaurants and
lunchrooms became full service restaurants. Since these categories did not exactly overlap, a correction
was used based on national data that the Census collected for both categories. This correction thus
involved multiplying the 1997 state-level values for limited service restaurants by the ratio of nationwide refreshment places to limited service restaurants. Similarly, 1997 state-level values for full service
restaurants were altered by multiplying these values by the national ratio of restaurants and lunchrooms
to full service restaurants. Data for years not covered are linearly interpolated and extrapolated. The
distinction between fast food and full service restaurants in the Census of Retail Trade is not clear-cut;
many full service restaurants serve the type of high-caloric, inexpensive food that fast food restaurants
serve. Therefore, our restaurant variable takes the sum of fast food restaurants, where in general people
pay before eating, and full service restaurants, which in general provide waiter/waitress service.
State taxes on gasoline are obtained from Facts and Figures on Government Finance. The
interpretation of the effect that the gasoline tax has on obesity can be looked at from two angles. On the
one hand increases in the gasoline tax could encourage people to walk and be more physically active. On
the other hand increases could be a proxy for increases in the time cost associated with traveling in order
to obtain healthy food. This could in turn encourage people to consume cheap, high-density convenience
food.
Included among the RHS variables are state cigarette taxes and clean indoor air laws. The
cigarette tax is taken from the Tax Burden on Tobacco. Clean indoor air laws are taken from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention website (http://www.cdc.gov). The four indoor air laws pertaining to
government workplaces, private workplaces, restaurants, and other places, are summed to form one
variable. We expect cigarette taxes to be a positive function of BMI, as smoking has been used as a
method of weight control (Fehily et al. 1984; Tomeo et al. 1999). A combination of federal and state tax

9

hikes, clean indoor air laws forbidding smoking in designated areas, and the anti-smoking campaign have
caused people to smoke less over time. This may be part of the reason for the increase in BMI over time,
an unintended consequence of the anti-smoking campaign.
Medical science has established the effects of caloric intake and physical activity on body mass
index, and caloric intake and physical activity are poorly measured in NHANES9; we therefore estimate
reduced form models. Our main concern in this paper is the effect that our state-level variables – in
particular, the per capita number of restaurants – have on trends in our outcome variables, body mass
index and obesity.
VII. Results
Table 3 shows means and standard deviations of the variables. Tables 4 and 5 show results where body
mass index and obese are the dependent variables. Results are pooled as well as stratified by gender.10
All regressions implement standard errors that cluster on state cells due to the aggregate nature of several
of our RHS variables. The per capita number of restaurants affects females more than males in both BMI
and obesity regressions. This is a poignant result, as it could reflect the increased cost of time, especially
for women who are working more and have less time for meal preparation at home. An increase in the
cigarette tax is shown to increase female BMI but not obesity. This is an expected result, as smoking
would lower a person’s BMI but not necessarily determine whether or not a person is obese. One can also
think of smoking as being correlated with other unhealthy behavior, such as lack of exercise. Blacks,
Hispanics, males, older people, and those who are married or widowed are more likely to have a higher
BMI, while those with higher incomes and those with a college education are more likely to have a lower
BMI. While males are more likely to have a higher BMI, they are less likely to be obese, reflecting the
way BMI tends to overestimate overweight and obesity in people with more muscular mass.11 Looking at

9

Caloric intake is based on 24-hour recall, and the measures for physical activity are not consistent across the three
NHANES data sets.
10
Tests for changes in coefficients across gender and race are statistically significant at the 1% level.
11
Males are more likely to be overweight yet less likely to be obese.

10

results for males and females separately, however, reveals that black males do not significantly have a
higher BMI, and males with higher incomes have a higher BMI.
Elasticities of BMI in Table 6 are computed at sample means using the coefficients from the
models in Table 4. The elasticities of the state-level variables are indicative, as they are based on results
which include time effects yet that nevertheless do not wipe out the effects of the policy variables. The
restaurant elasticity implies that as the per capita number of restaurants increases by 1%, the average body
mass index will rise by 0.09%, holding other covariates constant. Accordingly, if the per capita number
of restaurants experiences a 100 percent increase, the average body mass index will rise by 2.25 kg/m2 if
the mean is at 25 kg/m2.12 The gas tax at first appeared to have a negative effect when viewing the
coefficients in Tables 4 and 5, yet this switches signs at the mean, as seen in Table 6. This could mean
that people do not travel as much to obtain healthier food, an added cost to preparing food at home.
A possible source of concern is the potential endogeneity of the restaurant variable. Restaurants,
for example, are not randomly distributed, as they might locate themselves in areas with higher BMIs,
and/or be correlated with income. This can be overlooked somewhat when we see that the rise in
restaurants per capita began before the rise in obesity (see Figure 1 and Table 1). We experimented with
lagged restaurants per capita (lagged three years) and found that the positive and significant effect that the
per capita restaurants had on BMI and obesity did not disappear.13
By comparing the observed change in body mass index and obesity over time (in our case,
between 1971 and 1994) with the predicted change based on our model, we can determine how well we
have predicted BMI. According to Table 7, our model accounts for about 27% of the actual change in
body mass index for the pooled model, 79% for males, and only one percent for females. Clearly there is
12

Note that the average body mass index increased by 1.66 kg/m2 from 1971 to 1994 (see Table 7).
Using instrumental variables, such as female labor force participation, in an attempt to correct for the possible
omitted variables bias that exists is risky, as most instruments are weak and do not pass tests for exclusion
restrictions. Nevertheless, we ran models with state-level female labor force participation (and its square) as
instruments for the number of restaurants (and its square). Overidentification tests could not be run as the model
was exactly identified. While there were indications that the instruments were weak (F values in the first stage
hovered around 3), IV results were very similar to OLS results (carrying the same sign but slightly higher in
13

11

something going on with females that we have not been able to capture using this model. These values
can be obtained by dividing the total predicted change with the observed change. The increase in the per
capita number of restaurants makes the largest contribution to the body mass index outcome, accounting
for 54% of the growth in body mass index in the pooled model. Unmeasured factors over time account
for 73% of the growth in body mass index in the pooled model. In order to determine the impacts of
selected factors in Table 7, we multiplied the coefficients from our samples in Table 4 with the change in
that variable between 1971 and 1994, the initial and terminal years in our sample. Restaurants account
for a sizeable amount of the change in BMI over time.
VIII. Discussion
Obesity is now a major epidemic in the United States that calls for immediate attention. The ready
availability of inexpensive restaurants has not only caused people to consume more, but has made them
less active – less likely to prepare food at home or travel further distances to obtain a healthy meal. The
existence of numerous restaurants per capita facilitates caloric intake. And historically, man is
conditioned to consume in order to live well.14 Technological “advances” that have made daily chores
easier discourage physical activity, as does work that has increasingly become more sedentary over time.
Our model shows the rapid increase in obesity over time, especially during the 1980s, to be due in
part to the great increase in the per capita number of restaurants, and partly an unintended consequence of
the campaign to reduce smoking. The increased number of restaurants could be reflective of the
increased value of time for women. Possible solutions to the obesity problem might include publicly
financed education about dieting and exercise, although health information does not seem be lacking and
yet we still have an epidemic (Philipson 2001). If obesity is not only bad for one’s health but imposes
negative externalities on others, as do cigarettes, then taxing food might be a solution.15 If habits such as

magnitude, another indication of possibly weak instruments), and Durbin-Wu-Hausman tests indicated that OLS
regressions were consistent.
14
Obesity was once associated with wealth and power.
15
As Philipson suggests, taxing food would be a regressive move, affecting the poor more than the rich (Mitka
2003). He suggests subsidizing physical activity and/or tax breaks to people joining health clubs or businesses that
provide exercise opportunities to their workers.

12

eating healthily and being physically active are formed from childhood, perhaps our primary focus should
be on schools. Yet massive government intervention is not necessarily required. We realize that obesity
is a health problem, and may be one of the costs of economic progress. We have identified the problem
and recognized that we have a serious epidemic; finding a solution should be high on our agendas.
