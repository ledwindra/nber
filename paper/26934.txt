ABSTRACT
What are the medium- to long-term effects of pandemics? How do they differ from other
economic disasters? We study major pandemics using the rates of return on assets stretching back
to the 14th century. Significant macroeconomic after-effects of pandemics persist for about
decades, with real rates of return substantially depressed, in stark contrast to what happens after
wars. Our findings are consistent with the neoclassical growth model: capital is destroyed in
wars, but not in pandemics; pandemics instead may induce relative labor scarcity and/or a shift to
greater precautionary savings.

Introduction

How should we think about the medium- to long-term macroeconomic effects of global
pandemics? This is an important question for policymakers given the massive economic
fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak. The first instinct is to draw from the experience of
previous natural disasters and armed conflicts, for which the twentieth century provides
ample evidence. That instinct turns out to be wrong. In this paper we use the history of
major pandemics, major wars, and the rates of return since the 14th century to shed light
on this problem.
In many studies of pandemics, analysis has understandably focused on short-term
impacts. Even then, direct measures based on data from past episodes are not generally
available (e.g., in the U.S., Meltzer, Cox, and Fukuda, 1999). An alternative would be to
look at microeconomic outcomes of a given population in episodes for which high-quality
administrative data are available (e.g., in Sweden, Karlsson, Nilsson, and Pichler, 2014).
Absent such data, economic historians have to use more aggregated data at the regional
or national level to study the relationship between pandemic incidence and economic
outcomes (e.g., the 1918 flu epidemic across U.S. states Brainerd and Siegler, 2003; Barro,
Ursúa, and Weng, 2020). But again, most historical studies have typically focused on one
event in one country or region and have traced local outcomes for up to a decade at most.
Of course, the most devastating pandemic of the last millennium, the Black Death, has
attracted a great deal of scholarly attention. Economists and historians debate its pivotal
role in economic, social, and political change, particularly in Europe. Events such as the
Peasants’ Rebellion in England feature centrally in a narrative of rising worker power, and
the data speak to an emergence of labor scarcity seen in a positive deviation in the path
of real wages. This shock left England with a 25% to 40% drop in labor supply, a roughly
100% increase in real wages, and a decline in rates of return on land from about 8% to
5% (Clark, 2007, 2010). But it is an open question how representative the macroeconomic
responses in the case of the Black Death are of large pandemics in general.

Evidence: Past pandemic events and lessons for COVID-19. Here we take a macroeconomic view of the consequences of pandemics, and study the average effect of pandemics
across all major events since the Black Death, looking at outcomes up to 40 years out. In
large scale pandemics, effects will be felt across whole economies, or across wider regions,
for two reasons: either because the infection itself is widespread, or because trade and
market integration—in capital and/or labor markets—eventually propagates the economic
shock across borders.
To that end, our focus is on European pandemics since macroeconomic data are only
available in this region before modern times. We study rates of return on assets using a
dataset stretching back to the 14th century, focusing on 19 major pandemic events where
more than 100,000 people died. We also look at more limited evidence on real wages. The
events are listed in Figure 1 and, as is clear, the inability of researchers to precisely estimate
2

death tolls in past pandemics hinders our ability to consider event scaling in what follows.
Even for the most famous pandemic event, the Black Death, Herlihy (1997) asserts: “The
Black Death of 1348 and 1349, and the recurrent epidemics of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, were the most devastating natural disasters ever to strike Europe. We cannot cite
exact losses; there are no global figures.” Our Figure 1 shows that numerical uncertainty
afflicts all death tolls up to, and including, the 20th century. The baseline range of estimates
are taken from the newly published study of Cirillo and Taleb (2020), with alternatives
from other sources. For some pandemics, the range of estimates varies by a factor of 5
or 10 (e.g., The Italian Plague). Many vary by a factor of 2, such as the “small” plagues,
London, Sevilla, Marseille. Estimates for the Black Death itself range from 75 to 200 million.
Remarkably, even for as recent an event as the Hong Kong Flu of 1968–69, estimates vary by
a factor of 4, from 1 to 4 million. For the Cholera epidemics only a single, round number is
given in sources, suggesting a rough guess. Perhaps this should be no surprise: even now
in real time we see authorities, by accident or design, misreporting incorrect case and death
counts for COVID-19. Further scaling problems are created across time by the varying size
of the local or world population, which Cirillo and Taleb (2020) attempt to control for by
scaling up death tolls in past events to a 2020 estimate using the estimated growth of world
population over time. These rescaled figures are also shown in Figure 1 but they do not
change the ranking materially, and they remain subject to the same wide margins or error.
If anything, they tells us that there have been 17 “large pandemics” in our sample and a
further 2 “super pandemics”: the Black Death and the Spanish Flu. Given this discussion,
we identify events purely by a binary indicator, and do not try to scale, although we do
consider robustness of results to the inclusion or exclusion of the two super pandemics.
Does COVID-19 belong in this comparison group? To add context, the scenarios
contemplated as early as March 16, 2020 by Ferguson et al (2020) placed COVID-19 as the
most serious episode since the 1918 pandemic. Absent non-pharmaceutical interventions,
these researchers estimated the death toll at 510,000 in Britain and 2.2 million in the U.S.
Aggressive and recurrent suppression strategies would reduce the toll by a factor of 10
3

approximately, according to these authors.1 Worldwide, that could still leave COVID-19 as
the second most devastating event in over a century. As we write, global deaths totaled
over 500,000 by end-June 2020, so COVID-19 will become the 20th large pandemic event of
the kind described in Figure 1, and may eventually go far beyond the 1 million mark.
Theory: The natural rate and economic mechanisms after a pandemic. Here our main
interest is the response of the real natural rate of interest to a pandemic event. Introduced
by Wicksell, and central to modern macroeconomic theory and empirics (Laubach and
Williams, 2003; Wicksell, 1898; Woodford, 2003), the real natural rate of interest is the
level of real returns on safe assets which equilibrates an economy’s savings supply and
investment demand—while keeping prices stable. This latent equilibrium variable can
therefore serve as a useful barometer of medium-term fluctuations in economic dynamism.
In stagnant societies, savings are plentiful relative to investment opportunities (relatedly,
see, e.g. Summers, 2014, and his revival of the secular stagnation hypothesis). Formally, in
the canonical Ramsey (1928) model of neoclassical growth, it is well known that population
slowdown or greater preference to save depresses the natural rate (Rachel and Smith, 2017).
In the very long run, from century to century, the natural rate may drift slowly for
technological, political, or institutional reasons. But over a horizon of around 10–20 years,
medium-term deviations will dominate. Economic theory presumptively indicates that
pandemics could be felt in transitory downward shocks to the natural rate over such
horizons: investment demand is likely to wane, as labor scarcity in the economy suppresses
the need for high investment. At the same time, savers may react to the shock with increased
saving, either behaviorally as precautionary motives mount in bad times (cf. Malmendier
and Nagel, 2011), or simply to replace lost wealth used up during the peak of the calamity.
Indeed, 2020Q2 data for the United States showed a pronounced spike in household saving.
1 However, the uncertainty around these estimates is quite large. Also, the ability and willingness of some
countries to actually implement and sustain such suppression strategies properly is open to question. At the
time of writing (29th June 2020), both Britain and the U.S. have put some suppression strategies to work, so
the implied lower targets might yet be met, although we do not yet know how the eagerness to reopen the
economy may prevent that goal from being reached as the year progresses.

Data

To study the macroeconomic responses to historic pandemic events, we use data collected
over many years by many economic historians collectively, and then pulled together
gradually to form a continuous time series measuring economic indicators at annual
frequency in cities, regions, and countries from the 14th century to the present.
Historical interest rates from 1314 to 2018 compiled by Schmelzing (2020) are available at
the Bank of England’s data repository, where further details on data sources are given. The
dataset covers France (1387–2018), Germany (1326–2018), Italy (1314–2018), the Netherlands
(1400–2018), Spain (1400–1729, 1800–2018), and the U.K. (1314–2018). European real interest
rates are constructed by weighting real interest rates on long-term debt by GDP shares
(Maddison, 2010).2 The underlying assets are debt contracts “which are not contracted
short-term, which are not paid in-kind, which are not clearly of an involuntary nature,
which are not intra-governmental, and which are made to executive political bodies.” More
limited data for other time series are available for the UK in the same data repository. Data
on real wages for Great Britain from 1311 to 2016 come from the real consumption wage
series of Clark (2007) extended by Thomas and Dimsdale (2017). Data on real GDP per
capita for England from 1311 to 2016 are obtained from the real GDP per capita at market
prices series available in Thomas and Dimsdale (2017).

Empirical design

Pandemics, like natural disasters, offer a unique opportunity to study how economies work.
They are like a randomized control trial, but at a much larger scale, with microbiology
providing the natural assignment mechanism. Not surprisingly, our empirical approach
shares similar features with such a trial. Specifically, we use history as a guide to compare
the average path after a pandemic against its predicted counterfactual.
2 The

weighting follows Schmelzing (2020), but results are robust to alternative weightings and also hold
when we employ country-specific estimation as shown below. Aggregation weights do not sway the result.

5

Specifically, given what we observe, and using a historical sample, one can easily
construct the expected value of a future counterfactual outcome of interest. Similarly, one
can compute the expectation of that same outcome following pandemics. This is the key
idea behind the local projections estimator that we use (Jordà, 2005).
In particular, we characterize the response of the natural rate to a pandemic as
τ (h) = E(rt∗+h − rt∗ | Pt = 1 ; Ωt ) − E(rt∗+h − rt∗ | Pt = 0 ; Ωt ) ,

(1)

where rt∗+h − rt∗ refers to the change in the natural rate from the year the pandemic ends to
a future time h years later. Pt is a dummy variable that is 1 if there is a pandemic ending in
year t, and is 0 otherwise, and Ωt refers to the information set available at time t.3
We estimate τ (h) using local projections, specifically, using the set of regressions:
L

rt∗+h − rt∗−1 = αh + βh Pt + ∑ ρlh rt∗−1−l + eth+h ; h = 1, ..., H ,

(2)

l =1

where clearly τ̂ (h) = β̂ h . We choose 10 lags (L = 10) though the estimate β̂ h is unbiased
whether we include these controls or not.4
Our estimate of the natural rate of interest, rt∗ , is based on the following simple state
space model given the data that is available:
rt = rt∗ + ut ,

(3)

rt∗ = rt∗−1 + vt .
Here, the natural rate is a latent unobserved variable that follows a random walk. Such a
model is flexible enough to capture any secular trends without the need to specify them
3 Most

pandemics last for more than one year. We adopt as a timing convention the year when they end.
that because pandemics are unpredictable and completely exogenous to the economy, we could
omit Ωt from the conditioning information set. τ̂ (h) would still be unbiased. Including right-hand side
information improves the efficiency of the estimator. In other instances, when treatment is determined by
observables, this will not be true. Thus τ̂ (h) is basically the cumulative Average Treatment Effect of the
pandemic on interest rates, h periods later.

directly. The observed rate of interest r fluctuates around the natural rate r ∗ . The error
terms are assumed to be Normal and Equation 3 can be estimated using the Kalman filter
and maximum likelihood methods.

Results

These tools deliver the estimate of the natural rate shown in Figure 2a, based on an
aggregate using data from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the U.K. We
simply call this aggregate “Europe.” The figure displays the raw data on interest rates,
along with our estimate of the natural rate of interest. Our estimates of the natural rate
show the now well-documented secular trend decline over the centuries, from about 10%
in medieval times, to 5% at the start of the industrial revolution, and nowadays hovering
near 0%. It is easy to see that our estimate of the natural rate goes a long way towards
addressing the considerable annual volatility seen in the raw data. Beyond measurement
error, that noise also reflects wild fluctuations in harvests, armed conflict, and other events
to which pre-industrial societies were exposed to a much greater degree versus today. With
industrialization and modern finance, those fluctuations diminished considerably.
Figure 2b contains our main result, and displays τ̂ (h), the response of the natural rate
to a pandemic, 1 to 40 years into the future. Pandemics have effects that last for decades.
Following a pandemic, the natural rate of interest declines for years thereafter, reaching its
nadir about 20 years later, with the natural rate about 150 bps lower had the pandemic not
taken place. At about four decades later, the natural rate returns to the level it would be
expected to have had if the pandemic not taken place.
These results are staggering and speak of the disproportionate effects on the labor force
relative to land (and later capital) that pandemics had throughout the centuries. It is well
known that after major recessions associated with financial crises, history shows that real
safe rates can be depressed for 5 to 10 years (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2013), but the
responses here display even more pronounced persistence.

However, did all countries in the Europe experience pandemics in the same manner
shown? Is our choice of aggregation a problem? To answer that question, we turn to
Figure 2c where we present similar responses of the natural rate for each of the component
economies: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the U.K.
The heterogeneity of the responses turns out to be informative. At one end we have
countries like France, Italy, and Spain where the effects of pandemics are much larger
(3%–4% for France, Italy and Spain) in contrast to the Anglo-Saxon bloc of the Germany,
the Netherlands and the U.K., with far more modest effects on the natural rate.
This heterogeneity reflects, among other explanations, the timing of the pandemics
across countries, the relative exposure of each country to the pandemic, the relative size of
the working population, and how industrialized one economy was relative to another.

5.

Pandemics versus wars

A natural concern might be omitted variables, specifically the historical occurrence of
other macro-salient events that could persistently disturb real interest rates. One obvious
example is war. A clear confounding potential stems from the privations of wartime
conditions which make diseases more likely. For example, a plague, possibly the first
recorded influenza outbreak, occurred among the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War
(Thucydides, 2.47–54). However, the correlation of war and disease outbreaks is far from
being one.
On the other hand, for the economic indicator of interest in this study, the bias could
easily go the other way. Sovereign bond markets were to a large degree an innovation
whose origin was military necessity, and the fiscal state had perhaps its most important role
as an instrument of war (Brewer, 1990). Yet here the burden of raising large sums via debt
finance could just as easily imply higher real interest rates via conventional crowding out
arguments, or via risk-premium (e.g., default) channels, or simply due to capital scarcity
created by wartime physical capital destruction (a feature absent in pandemics).

9

To address this concern here we control for wars, by using an indicator variable Wart
which is set equal to one in any year in which war-time deaths in Europe exceed 20,000.
We obtain the war-time military personnel casualties from Schmelzing (2020) dataset who
draws data from Table 4.1 in Levy (1983).5,6
We then estimate an augmented local projection to include controls for war. Specifically,
we estimate
L

L

l =1

l =1

rt∗+h − rt∗ = αh + βh Pt + γh Wart + ∑ ρlh rt∗−l + ∑ φlh Wart−l + eth+h ; h = 1, ..., H ,

(4)

where we include also the lagged values of this indicator as controls, where the coefficients
γh are the impulse response of the real interest to a war event in year 0.7
Figure 3a shows the result of this exercise. Our main finding is robust. The dynamic
response of the real natural rates to pandemics is as before, and slightly amplified: lower
for 30–40 years and in a statistically significant way. But as we anticipated, the effect of war
goes the other way: wars tend to leave real interest rates elevated for 30–40 years and in an
economically (and statistically) significant way, as shown in panel (a) of Table 1.
Real wages. By defining pandemics as events with 100,000 or more deaths, we have thus
far identified episodes with large contractions in the labor force and, hence, in the ratio of
labor to capital. We see this as one explanation for the response of the real natural rate of
interest. If so, we should see a countervailing response in real wages, and this provides
another consistency check. To explore whether this is indeed the case, we use a similar
local projection estimator in Figure 3b where instead of the real natural rate, we use real
wages in Great Britain as the response variable and in the control set.
5 Total number of battle deaths are divided by duration of the battle (in years) to obtain an annual series
of battle deaths. Since battles lasted more than a year, sometimes more than a decade, we think 20,000 deaths
per year is comparable to the pandemic death toll threshold of 100,000 we employ.
6 Readers interested in the debate on severity of pre–19th century epidemics may refer to Alfani and
Murphy (2017), Roosen and Curtis (2018), and Biraben (1975), among others.
7 Wars often last for several years. We focus on war-year pairs with 20,000 casualties or more. Hence, to
eliminate the overlapping effect of large casualties felt over consecutive years, we add up to 10 lags of our
dummy variable as a right-hand side variable.

The response of real wages is in the opposite direction to the response of the real
natural rate, with its effects being felt over decades. The figure shows that real wages
grow gradually so that forty years out the cumulative deviation in the real wage is +15%.
Contrast the response of wages after wars, which remain pretty much unchanged. A formal
test of the differences is provided in panel (b) of Table 1. These results match the predictions
of the neoclassical model, and accord with historical narratives: the Black Death induced
labor scarcity in the European economy, and pushed real wages up. In equilibrium, this
went hand in hand with lower returns to capital.
Real GDP per capita. Finally, we display the response of real GDP per capita in Figure 3c
for England (the only economy for which we have long-run data). Here again, the contrast
between wars and pandemics is self-evident (with formal tests provided in panel (c) of
Table 1). The destruction of capital (and loss of lives) during wars, has a noticeable negative
effect on labor productivity that is absent in pandemics, where in fact, labor productivity
increases.
Debt sustainability and r − g. While the short-run fallout from pandemics looks similar
to other economic disasters—large and sudden declines in economic activity—the mediumto long-run economic consequences are staggeringly different, as we have shown. And these
differences matter for policymakers. In any such abrupt downturn, the textbook response
is to either borrow to smooth the shock, or to pursue aggressive stimulative fiscal policy to
counter the shock. Both will likely result in a rapid buildup of public debt. However, the
sustainability of such debt depends crucially on the type of economic disaster confronted.
In order to illustrate this point we turn to Figure 3d. This figure shows the response
of the real natural rate minus the growth rate of real GDP per capita, call it r − g, using
natural rate data only for the U.K. and for real GDP per capita growth rates for England, as
above. If this difference becomes more negative, it becomes easier to sustain higher levels of
debt. Conversely, when this difference becomes more positive, debt sustainability becomes

13

harder. Once again, we see that pandemics and wars have very different consequences in
this respect as well.
Figure 3d shows that in the aftermath of pandemics, r − g becomes slightly negative, by
about 50 basis points around the 20 year mark, before returning back to equilibrium. In
contrast, wars result in a boost of about 100 basis points, peaking around the 30 year mark.
Panel (d) in Table 1 shows evaluates the differences between these two paths every decade.
Though the statistical evidence is not as strong as in previous experiments, the economic
differences are patently clear.

Robustness

Robustness to possible major trend breaks. Schmelzing (2020) proposes three historical
dates at which the trend for the real interest rate could have changed. These are the
“post–Bullion famine” period following the end of the global monetary contraction (1494),
the “North-Weingast” institutional revolution that led to emergence of credible public
debt mechanisms in Britain (1694), and the “post-Napoleonic” founding of the modern
international state system (1820). Although the state-space model from Equation 3 is
sufficiently flexible, to confirm that our results are not affected by such shifts, we add
controls for time trends starting at these historical dates. Figure 4a plots the new estimated
response of the European real natural rate following a pandemic event. As the figure shows,
our baseline result is largely unchanged. The trough is similar and happens at about the
same time.
Robustness when excluding small and localized pandemics. The plagues of London,
Sevilla, and Marseille in Figure 1 were largely localized, not affecting the wider European
region very much. Some other plagues had relatively small death totals. One may therefore
be concerned that these relatively smaller events could attenuate the response of the
aggregate European real natural rate. Figure 4b recalculates the response of the real rate

when omitting the five smallest pandemics in Figure 1. The peak response in the real
natural rate is slightly larger when estimated with the remaining “global” pandemics, as
one would expect. These smaller pandemics exerted a smaller influence on the real rate.
Robustness when excluding the Black Death and the Spanish Flu events. Finally, in
Figure 4 we consider removing from the sample the two largest events in history, the Black
Death and the Spanish Flu. The resulting response is presented in Figure 4c. The Black
Death stands out for having decimated the European population, thus having an outsize
weight in explaining the decline of the natural rate. Although the Spanish Flu was not quite
as deadly as the Black Death, it came on the heels of WW1 and was followed ten years
later by the Great Depression. Naturally one might worry that the decline in the natural
interest rate was due to the Great Depression and not the pandemic. However, as Figure 4c
shows, removing these two influential events from the sample does not affect our main
result materially.

Conclusions

Summing up our findings, the great historical pandemics of the last millennium have
typically been associated with subsequent low returns to assets, as far as the limited data
allow us to conclude. These responses are huge. Smaller responses are found in real wages,
but still statistically significant, and consistent with the baseline neoclassical model.
Measured by deviations in a benchmark economic statistic, the real natural rate of
interest, these responses indicate that pandemics are followed by sustained periods—over
multiple decades—with depressed investment opportunities, possibly due to excess capital
per unit of surviving labor, and/or heightened desires to save, possibly due to an increase
in precautionary saving or a rebuilding of depleted wealth. Either way, if the trends play
out similarly in the wake of COVID-19 then the global economic trajectory will be very
different than was expected only a few months ago.

16

Should we expect declines of 1.5%–2% in the real natural rate, however? There may be
at least three factors that could possibly attenuate the decline of the natural rate predicted
by our analysis, but their presence and magnitude is uncertain and unknowable until
therapies to fight COVID-19 are more developed. First, the death toll of COVID-19 relative
to the total population might be smaller than in the worst pandemics of the past, but we
cannot know for sure at this point. Second, COVID-19 primarily affects the elderly, who
are no longer in the labor force and tend to save relatively more than the young, so the
demographic channels could be altered, although the recent pick up in infections is now
affecting younger individuals. Third, aggressive counter-pandemic fiscal expansion will
boost public debt further, reducing the national savings rate and this might put upward
pressure on the natural rate, even though our analysis suggests that this expansion of public
debt should be easier to sustain in the long-run.

Appendix: Estimation of trends

We use the following state-space system, presented in Equation 3, to estimate trends for log real
wages and log real GDP per capita. Let yt be the variable whose potential trend y∗t is to be estimated,
where gt is the growth rate of the potential trend.
ŷt = yt − y∗t ,

Notes: Raw data for real wages in Great Britain and real GDP per capita of England are obtained from Thomas and Dimsdale (2017). Trends estimated with a state-space system following Laubach and Williams (2003), presented in Equation 5. Real GDP
per capita series is based on market prices and is quoted in “£mn, chained volume measure, 2013 prices.” Real wages are in the form
of an index where 1900 real wages are normalized to 100. In the graphs presented, these series are plotted on log-scale.
