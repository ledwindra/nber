Unemployment, Unsatisfied Demand for Labor, and
Compensation Growth in the United States, 1956—1980

ABSTRACT

This paper presents two key facts which call into question the
value of unemployment rates as barometers of labor market tightness.
First, while both unemployment rates and unsatisfied labor demand
proxies perform reasonably well on their own in compensation growth
equations, in models which include both, only the unsatisfied demand

variable appears to matter. Second, the past decade's outward shifts
in Phillips plots can to a substantial degree be tied to outward
shifts in plots pairing the relevant unemployment rate and unsatisfied

demand proxies. The paper also provides results which indicate that
Phillips relationships which are defined in terms of unsatL'fied
demand variables appear to be somewhat more stable than those using
unemployment rates.

Taken together, our findings have a clear message for those

concerned with macroeconomic theory and policy: labor market pressure
on wages can be more reliably assessed by looking at measures of
unsatisfied labor demand than by looking at the unemployment rates
on which most earlier analyses have focused.

Virtually all empirical analyses of short run aggregate wage growth

have an unemployment rate at their heart.' What lies behind the expected
inverse relationship between unemployment and the rate of growth in wages?
The following quotation clearly presents the standard rationale for

including an unemployment rate variable in wage growth regressions: "In
a given labor market, wages tend to rise under conditions of excess demand,
fall with excess supply, arid remain constant when excess demands are zero.

Since the aggregate unemployment rate is a good indicator of the general
state of labor markets, as unemployment decreases, more and more markets
come into a state of excess demand and the general pace of wage inflation
increases.

For an unemployment rate to in fact be "a good indicator of the general

state of labor markets," two conditions must be satisfied. First, a given
unemployment rate must represent the same number of available units of

labor at each point in time. Second, the relationship between the number
of available units of labor and labor market tightness must remain constant,

which implies that there must be stability in the relationship between

number of units of labor available and unsatisfied labor demand. Thus,
if the unemployment rate does not mirror the number of available units
of labor or if the importance of structural unemployment changes over
time, the unemployment rate will not be a good indicator of wage pressure
from labor market imbalance.

This paper presents evidence concerning the use of various unemployment

rates as barometers of tightness in the labor market. In Section I, we
demonstrate that proxies for the unsatisfied demand for labor (the help

2

wanted index and the manufacturing quit rate) perform at least as
well as either the official or the prime age male unemployment rate

when entered alone in wage growth regressions. Moreover, we find
that in regressions which include both an unemployment rate and a
measure of unsatisfied labor demand, the unemployment rate does not

matter while the unsatisfied demand proxy does. The second section
presents evidence which strongly suggests that, at least for the
United States, a substantial fraction of the growing instability
in Phillips relationships (again defined in terms of either the
official or prime age male unemployment rates) can be linked to
growing instability in the relationship between unsatisfied

labor demand and the relevant rate of unemployment. Furthermore, the
relationship between our unsatisfied demand proxies and
the rate of compensation growth appears to have been more stable
than the relationship between unemployment and the rate of

compensation growth. In sum, measures of employers' unsatisfied
labor demand dominate measured unemployment rates as indicators

of wage pressure emanating from labor market conditions. Section
III discusses the interpretation of our empirical findings. The
paper's concluding section discusses the main implication of our
analysis for:macroecoflomic theory and policy, that labor market

pressure on wages can be more reliably assessed by looking at
measures of unsatisfied demand than at the unemployment rates
which have played the key role in earlier analyses, and emphasizes
the need for new microdata if we are to fully understand why.

I.

Compensation Growth and Its Correlates

Most economists would think it important to consider the role of "tight"
versus "loose" labor markets as part of any study of wage growth. Since the
appearance of Phillips' very influential 1958 article, most econometric
analyses of wage growth have attempted to gauge the degree of labor market

tightness with an unemployment rate variable. An alternative approach
would be to use available proxies for the unsatisfied demand for labor to

assess how tight labor markets are. In this section, two such variables
are experimented with. These unsatisfied demand variables perform well
when they replace the unemployment rate in standard compensation growth
equations. Of greater interest, however, is the finding that in compensaticn
growth equations which include both an unemployment variable and an
unsatisfied demand proxy, only the unsatisfied demand variable matters.

Model Specification

While the rationale for including an unemployment rate variable in wage
growth equations is not always clearly stated, the most prevalant notion
seems to be that the unemployment rate should be highly correlated with the

degree of excess demand in the labor market. A similar argument might be
made regarding the inclusion of some measure of employers' unsatisfied

demand for labor in place of an unemployment rate variable. A priori,
such a measure should be at least as likely as any unemployment rate to
be highly correlated with the excess demand for labor.

The labor market variable which has most commonly appeared in wage

growth equations is the official unemployment rate. One important question

4

is whether the official (total civilian labor force) unemployment rate
adequately reflects the availability of qualified potential employees.
Various researchers have argued that women and teenagers are less likely

to possess, or to be seen as possessing, requisite oh skills and comrdtment

than prime age males. This line of reasoning h8s lead many to believe that
the prime age male (men 25 to 5L) unemloYment rate might he a better variable
to use in wage growth equations than the

official rate.

As mentioned above, measures of the unsatisfied demand for labor
could be substituted for the unemployment rate in wage growth models.
One likely candidate for the job of measuring the degree to which employers'
demands for labor are unsatisfied is the job vacancy rate.

Another possible

unsatisfied demand measure is the fraction of employers' work forces choosing

to leave their jobs during a given time period. Some job vacancies arise
because a new job has been created rather than because someone has quit and
the job vacancy rate reflects both the flow and the duration of job openings,
so that the vacancy rate and the quit rate will not mirror each other

perfectly. Nonetheless, the quit rate should be highly correlated with
the seemingly better unsatisfied demand proxy, the vacancy rate.

The first compensation growth equations presented in this paper include
either an unemployment rate:

n

(1) w/w

c. +

2 l.(f/p)
B(l/u) + j=l

j

or an unsatisfied demand variable:

n

(2) i/w =

c.

+

(l/d) + j=l Ij (a/p) t—j

where 1/w is the rate of growth of nominal hourly compensation, u is the chosen
unemployment rate, d is the chosen unsatisfied demand proxy,

is the rate

of inflation in period t—j, and c, 3, y and the 1. are regression coefficients.

5

The reasoning behind including labor market variables in wage growth equations
stated above implies that 3 should be positive (unemployment negatively
related to the rate of wage growth) and that y should be negative (unsatisfied
demand positively related to the rate of wage growth).

One way to ascertain whether unemployment rates or our unsatisfied demand
proxies represent better measures of labor market tightness might be to include

both together in estimated Phillips—type equations. For this reason, perhaps
the most interesting wage growth regressions presented in this paper are those

which include both an unemployment rate and a measure of unsatisfied demand.
The relevant regression model can be written as:

(3) /w =

+

(l/u) +

y(l/d)

+

.X.(/p)

where all the variables are defined as above.

The Role of Inflation

We have included either four or sixteen lagged inflation values ((k/p).
terms) in the compensation growth equations presented in this paper instead of
a single variable intended to capture the expected rate of inflation in the

current period ((/p)). There are several considerations which lead us to
this course of action.
First, there is rio generally accepted expected inflation series which we

could have used even had we wanted to. The usual approach to generating an
expected inflation series is to assume that people expect a current rate of
inflation equal to some distributed lag function of past inflation, with the

distributed lag weights based on previous inflation history. This seems
unrealistic insofar as many factors other than past rates of inflation will

have an effect on current inflationary expectations. One way to construct a
more realistic expected inflation series might be to survey a random sample

6

of the population on a regular basis, asking those surveyed what they expect
the average rate of inflation to be over the period until the next such

survey. Unfortunately, reliable data of this sort have not been collected.3
Suppose we could have obtained a time series which accurately
captured expectations each period regarding the rate of inflation in

the immediately subsequent period. Even if the rate of wage growth
reflected only labor market conditions and expectations regarding
inflation, more than the single expected inflation variable just

described should play an important role. For one thing, in a world
where union wage contracts are typically set for three years at a
time, some period t wage changes may reflect period t price change
expectations generated up to three years earlier, rather than period t
price change expectations based on information through period t—l.
A similar situation will exist in nonunion establishments to the
extent that across—the--board wage increases may occur only at annual

intervals. Entering a large number of lagged inflation terms (we
experiment with as many as sixteen) may allow us to capture the
price change expectations which should have existed at the time
the oldest union contract still in force as of period t would have
been negotiated, at least to the extent that price change expectations

are a function of past price changes. Including a single (Ip)
variable based on a rolling ARIMA or other mechanistic model using price
data through period t—l would have been considerably more restrictive.
Perhaps more fundamentally, there is no clear reason why
quarter t wage changes should reflect only quarter t expected price

changes. Particularly where workers remain attached to the same
employers over relatively long time periods,4 moiey wanes may reflect
the expected pace of inflation over some longer horizon but not

necessarily during a single quarter. One would expect the parties
negotiating a wage bargain in period t to be concerned about the

7
expected rates of inflation in periods t, t+l, t+2, and so on through

period t+n, the end of the relevant time horizon. Again, entering lagged
inflation terms rather than a single (IIp) term based on inflation
through period t—l allows added flexibility; the coefficients on lagged
price terms may reflect their influence on longer term as well as on
current period inflationary expectations.
Finally, to the extent that inflation is not always perfectly
foreseen, past rates of inflation may play an important role in their

own right rather than solely because they influence expectations.
Under many union contracts, cost of living adjustment (COLA) clauses
provide for wage increases tied directly to the rate of inflation;
union members covered by COLA clauses ar€ thus at least partially protected

against unforeseen price increases. Where prices have grown faster
than wages, both union and nonunion workers may receive "catch—up"
wage increases that are independent of what the rate of inflation is

expected to be in the future. The existence of both COLA and "catch—up"
wage increases provides an additional rationale for including lagged
inflation terms in wage growth equations.

To summarize, the two main reasons we chose to specify our wage
growth equations with lagged inflation values rather than a single

(/p)e variable are, first, that no generally accepted expected
inflation series is available and, second, that the relationship
between inflation and wage growth is almost certainly much more
complicated than could be captured by including a single price
expectations variable in the model.

8

Data Used for Model Estimation
Throughout this study, we use both the official unemployment rate
(which refers to the entire civilian labor force) and the prime age male

unemployment rate (which refers only to male civilian labor force members

who are between 25 and 54 years old). Two variables serve as unsatisfied
demand proxies (the d variable in equations (2) and (3)):

the help wanted index

and the manufacturing quit rate. The help wanted index is used as a
vacancy surrogate since no suitable vacancy series is available. This
index is based on counts of help wanted advertisements printed in the

classified sections of leading newspapers in approximately 50 Standard
Metropolitan Statistical Areas.5 One potential problem with using the
help wanted index rather than actual vacancy data is that affirmative
action pressures may have led to greater advertising of available job
openings, particularly after the AT&T consent decree was signed in 1973,
so the help wanted index may have trended upwards relative to the number

of vacancies. Any decline in the price of newspaper advertisements relative
to the price of other methods of recruiting employees would also have a

similar effect. The fact that forces other than affirmative actior can
affect the amount of help wanted advertising done by employers is consistent
with the paths of the normalized Canadian help wanted index and
Canadian job vacancy rate during the period from the beginning of
1971 through the end of 1978; the help wanted index
seems to have trended uDwards somewhat relative to the vacancy

rate after 1974. Note that the help wanted index as reported by the Conference
Board is a proxy for number of vacancies, not the vacancy rate; to create a
variable that we could use as a rate proxy, we divided the published help wanted
index by the number of employees on nonagricultural payrolls.6 Monthly quit

rate information exists only for the manufacturing sector; these data are collected
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in its "Monthly Report on Labor Turnover".7
Recall that our estimating equations are written with the rate of growth
in nominal compensation as the dependent variable and

lagged inflation

terms on the right hand side. The hourly compensation series we used for
calculating *1w, the rate of growth in nominal compensation, was generated
by BLS; they divided total compensation of nonfarm business sector
employees as reported in the National Income and Product Accounts by the
total number of payroll hours in private nonagricultural establishments.
The employee compensation figure in the National Accounts includes wages
and salaries, employer contributions to social insurance programs such
as Social Security and unemployment insurance, and other labor income
such as employer contributions to private pension and welfare funds.8

As noted above, we entered either four or sixteen lagged inflation

variables into all our regression models. As far as the choice of an
appropriate price deflator series to use for cDnstructing these lagged
inflation terms, it is important to note that in a world with more
than one commodity, the price series that is relevant for suppliers
of labor will very likely differ from the price series that is

relevant for demanders of labor. One would expect labor suppliers
to be concerned about their earnings relative to the price of the

bundle of commodities they consume, whereas labor demanders should
be concerned about the wages they pay relative to their product

prices. Using lagged inflation terms based on the Gros Natiohal
Product (CNP) deflator thus seemed like a reasonable compromise
between the price relevant to consumers and the price relevant to
producers.

10

The Data Resources, Inc. (DRI) computer system was the source of all
of the data and programs used in conducting the analyses under discussion.
All of the reported regressions were fit on the DRI system with seasonally
adjusted quarterly data for 1956:1 through 1980:3 and were estimated using
a maximum likelihood correction for first—order serial correlation.9

Compensation Growth: Unutilized Supplyersus Unsatisfied Demand

Table 1 presents compensation growth equations which include a single
labor market variable and either four or sixteen lagged inflation terms

based on the GNP deflator. The official unemployment rate, the prime age
male unemployment rate, the help wanted index and the manufacturing quit
rate are each entered in inverse form as alternative measures of labor

market conditions. The unemployment rate variables consistently assume
the expected positive sign and the unsatisfied demand variables uniformly

take on the expected negative sign. The official unemployment rate
coefficient is not statistically significant in the model with four
lagged inflation terms; it achieves statistical significance in

the model with sixteen lagged inflation terms.1° All of the
prime age male unemployment rate, help wanted index and
manufacturing quit rate coefficients are statistically

significant. The 's for the unsatisfied demand variable models are
consistently larger than the R2's for the unemployment rate models.
This would seem to suggest that the unsatisfied demand variables work
better than the unemployment rates we have used; however, the magnitude
of the differences in R's between the two sets of models are small,

so no strong conclusion regarding the relative strength of the various
labor market variables seems warranted on this basis alone.1

Table 2 presents cnpe1isation growth equations which include both an

or the inverse of the manufacturing quit rate. Once either of the unsatisfied

no longer retain their expected positive

are uniformly negative, though never significant.

rate variable coefficients

The prime age male unemployment

rate performs just as poorly as the official unemployment rate, even though
some have argued that it is a better indicator of unutilized

labOr supply. In contrast, all of the coefficients on the two
variables we have chosen as proxies for the level of unsatisfied demand,
the inverse of the help wanted index and the inverse of the manufacturing
quit rate, are of the expected negative sign and statistically significant.12

The Sensitivity of Our Results to Alternative Spçifications

Thus far we have explicitly or implicitly made a number of assumptions
about the "proper" specification of the compensation growth models we have

estimated. Fortunately, our central conclusions appear to be quite robust
with respect to alternative plausible specifications.
The key compensation growth (i/w) models presented in the text included
an unsatisfied demand variable (either the help wanted index or the quit

rate) in inverse form (lid). We chose this functional form because it
matched the way the unemployment rate is usually entered in this sort of
regression (as 1/u) and because regressions with both d and d2 as independent
variables indicated that 'z/w increases with d at a decreasing rate. We
did replicate all of the relevant Table 1 and Table 2 models with d or
log d replacing lid; our qualitative results were completely unaffected
by this substitution.

Another question which might be raised concerning the results presented
is whether the Perry—weighted unemployment rate might not be a better variable
to use than either the official or the prime age male rate.13 Through 1978:4, the
last quarter for which we could calculate the Perry—weighted unemployment
rate, the Perry—weighted and the prime age male unernplyment rates were

correlated .991. Not surprisingly, substituting the Perry—weighted rate
for the prime age male rate did not alter the message of our results.
A third possibility we considered was that unemployment and/or our

unsatisfied demand variables might affect /w with some lag rather than
concurrently. To determine whether allowing for delayed impacts would
alter our central conclusions, we re—estimated each of the models in Table 1
and Table 2 with four lagged values of 1/u and four lagged values of l/d

added wherever a current value of 1/u or 1/d appeared. The sums of the
coefficients on the 1/u variables and l/d variables were uniformly very
similar to the 1/u and l/d coefficients in our original models.
A fourth specification issue which seemed potentially important was

that, as has been suggested by Robert J. Gordon and George Perry,
certain periods during the past two decades are likely to have had
below or above average wage growth because of events which would not
make their way into a normal wage growth model.

14

Respecified models

which included dummy variables for each of three periods (1964:1 to
1966:2, when the Johnson guideposts were in effect; 1971:3
to 1972:4, the Nixon controls period; and 1974:2 to 1975:1, quarters
during which our country witnessed very sharp increases in oil prices)
produced conclusions no different than those based on the original
regressions.

15

Another question which might be raised regarding our results is
whether the higher rate of growth in hourly compensation associated with
increases in either the help wanted index or the quit rate actually
reflects higher base wage rates as opposed to greater use of overtime

hours and thus more time worked for premium pay. From the point of view
of understanding what factors lie behind inflation, the answer to this

question may not be particularly important. Nevertheless, we did try
adding a measure of average weekly overtime hours in manufacturing to

each of those models which included an unsatisfied demand variable. The
overtime hours variable was always completely insignificant and none of
the affected 1/u or l/d coefficients increased or decreased appreciably.

It should also be noted that the inverse of this overtime hours variable
performed in very much the same way as the inverse of the help wanted index
or the inverse of the quit rate when used alone as a proxy for unsatisfied
demand in models like those in Table 1 and Table 2.

A sixth issue which deserves mention is our choice of an inflation
series to appear on the right hand side of our compensation growth models.

We picked the GNP deflator in an attempt to strike a compromise between
the prices most relevant to labor suppliers and the price most relevant to

labor demanders. Redoing the Table 1 and Table 2 analyses with a more
"supplier oriented" price index (the Implicit Consumption deflator,

considered vastly superior to the Consumer Price Index because of its
treatment of housing expenditures) and then again with a more "demander

oriented" price index (the Wholesale Price index) changed none of our
conclusions.

Thus, the central implications of the compensation growth equations
reported in Table 1 and Table 2 appear to be quite robust with respect to

16

the precise model specification used. When entered separately, both
unemployment and our unsatisfied demand variables perform in the expected
fashion, with unemployment negatively and unsatisfied demand positively

related to the rate of compensation growth (although inevery instance but
one the R2's in the unsatisfied demand models were larger than the 2's in
the comparable unemployment models). However, in equations which include
both an unemployment rate variable and an unsatisfied demand proxy, only

the unsatisfied demand variable matters. We will wait until Section III
to discuss a possible interpretation of these results.

II. Observed Instability in the Phillips Curve Relationship

One empirical phenomenon which has received considerable attention
during the past decade has been the breakdown in the Phillips

relationship.15 This event is consistent with the hypothesis of Milton Friedman
and Edmund Phelps that revisions in inflationary expectations will cause outward

shifts in the short run Phillips curve)0 While inflation is
clearly important, we believe that a substantial fraction of the
outward shift in the Phillips curve may be linked to an outward shift
in the inverse relationship between unemployment and the unsatisfied

demand for labor. Furthermore, the relationship between unsatisfied
demand and compensation growth appears to have been more
stable than the relationship between unemployment and compensation
growth.

b. The percentage change in average hourly compensation variable is the
percentage change in fourth quarter average hourly compensation between the
given year and the preceding year.

18

given value of the official unemployment rate has been substantially

higher since 1970 than prior to that date. The curve linking percentage
change in average hourly compensation to the official unemployment rate
appears to have shifted outward first in 1970 arid then again in 1974; a

smaller backward shift seems to have occurred after 1976.

As demonstrated in Figure lB, the relationship between the rate of
growth in compensation and the prime age male unemployment rate has

exhibited a similar shift pattern. Sharp outward shifts in 1970 and
1974 appear to have been followed by a smaller backward shift after
1976.

The question we are interested in answering is whether the observed
shifts in both the official unemployment rate and prime age male
unemployment rate Phillips relationships are somehow related to changes

in the relationship between unemployment and unsatisfied demand. There
is at least good circumstantial evidence which suggests that this
question should be answered in the affirmative.

Plots of the Shifting Relationship Between Unemployment
and Unsatisfied Demand
Figure 2 presents plots relating each of our two unsatisfied demand
proxies for the United States, the normalized help wanted index and the
manufacturing quit rate, to the official United States rate of unemployment.
In both plots, the points from 1958 through 1969 seem to lie more or less

along a single curve. Both plots exhibit a dramatic shift outward in 1970,
which is when the first obvious outward shift in the official unemployment

rate Phillips relation occurred.17 The help wanted index versus official
unemployment rate plot shifts sharply outward again after 1974, but the

quit rate versus official unemployment rate plot does not. As was mentioned
earlier, the volume of help wanted advertising may have increased during
the middle and late 1970's because of increased affirmative action pressures;

this could have caused the post—1974 shift in Figure 2A even if there were

no shift in the underlying vacancy versus unemployment relationship. The
outward shift in the official unemployment rate Phillips curve which
occurred in 1974 thus might better be linked to the sharp increase in the

price of oil around the same date than to labor market changes. The
quit rate versus official unemployment rate plot may have shifted
slightly backwards after 1977; no backward shift appears in the help

wanted index versus official unemployment rate plot. As noted earlier,
the official unemployment rate Phillips relation appeared to shift
backward after 1976.
Figure 3 presents plots like those in Figure 2 ,

except with the

prime age male unemployment rate substituted for the official unemployment

rate. While the shifts in the Figure 3 plots are somewhat less pronounced
than those in Figure 2, their timing is very similar. The same connections
can be drawn between each of the two unsatisfied demand proxy versus prime
age male unemployment rate plots and the prime age male unemployment rate
Phillips curve plot as were drawn between the relevant pairs of official
unemployment rate plots.

It is interesting to note that the relationship between unsatisfied
demand and unemployment seems also to have been quite unstable in a large

number of other developed countries. Beveridge curve (job vacancy rate
versus overall unemployment rate) plots for Canada, the United Kingdom,
Japan, France, Norway, Finland and Australia all clearly exhibit sharp outward

shifts during the late 1960's and early 1970,8.18 It would be of considerable
interest to conduct a careful exploration of whether these Beveridge
curve shifts might also be linked to movements in the relevant countries'
Phillips curves.

While looking at pictures is interesting, quantifying the extent to
which shifts in the United States' official unemployment rate and prime age male
unemployment rate Phillips relationships might be linked to the shifting
relationship between these unemployment variables and unsatisfied demand

can perhaps better be accomplished econometrically. Let us turn to the appropriate regressions.

Econometric Evidence Regarding the Shifting Phillips Curve

To summarize the magnitude of the overall shift in the Phillips
relations shown in Figures 1A and lB, we estimated equations of the
following form:

(4) /w

a + 13(lIu) + St,

where u is either the official or the prime age male unemployment rate and
t is a time trend. The estimate of cS from the official rate regression
indicates that

the

annual rate of wage growth associated with any given

level of unemployment grew by approximately 6.1 percentage points between

1956 and 1980. Over the same period, the similarly estimated shift in
the prime age male relationship was approximately 5.7 percentage points.

Adding an unsatisfied demand variable to equation (4) is one
approach to estimating the extent to which these upward shifts can
be linked to the changing relationship between unemployment and

unsatisfied demand. The relevant regression is:

(5) i/w =

a +

(1/u) + cSt + Y(1/d),

where d may be either the normalized help wanted index or the manufacturing

quit rate and the other variables are as before. To the extent that
the outward shifting of the relationship between /w and 1/u, indicated

by >0 in equation

(4),

can be linked to the shifting

relationship

23

between 1/u and l/d, the estimate of

in equation (5) should fall toward

zero. Introducing the normalized help wanted index variable into the
official rate equation reduced the magnitude of the estimated time trend
by 20 percent; adding the manufacturing quit rate variable reduced the

official rate equation time trend by 29 percent. In the prime age
male models, the introduction of the inverse of the help wanted index
knocked the estimated time trend down by 23 percent and adding the
inverse of the manufacturing quit rate lowered the estimated time trend

by 25 percent. Thus, this approach suggests that between 20 and 30 percent
of the observed upward shift in these Phillips relationships may be
linked to the shifting relationship between unemployment and unsatisfied
demand.

Econometrically estimated Phillips curves more typically include
a variable or variables intended to capture the impact of the rate of

inflation. In this paper we have focused primarily on augmented Phillips
curve equations containing either four or sixteen lagged inflation

terms. An alternative approach to assessing the role of the shifting
relationship

between unemployment and unsatisfied demand would be to

look at the time trend remaining after lagged inflation terms have
been introduced into the wage growth model, then to add an unsatisfied
demand variable to see whether it can knock out the residual time
time trend in the augmented model.
The first and fourth columns of Table 3 contain regressions of

the following form estimated using the official unemployment rate and

lagged inflation terms (column (1)) implies that the annual rate of wage
growth associated with any given level of the official unemployment rate
would have been approximately 2.1 percentage points higher in 1980 than
in 1956, even if the four previous quarters' inflation rates had been

the same. The point estimate of the time trend coefficient in the model
with sixteen lagged inflation terms (column (4)) implies that the annual
rate of wage growth would have been approximately 1.2 percentage points
higher in 1980 than in 1956, again holding the official unemployment

rate and the relevant inflation rate history constant. The coefficient
in the model with four lagged inflation values is strongly significant,
but when sixteen lagged inflation values are included in the model, the

time trend coefficient loses its significance. The point estimates of
these time trends are 66 percent and 81 percent smaller than the time
trend in the crude Phillips curve with no lagged inflation terms based
on the official unemployment rate, which means that a residual shift
between 19 and 34 percent of the total remains to be explained.

If this residual shift is related to the outward shift in the
relationship between unemployment and unsatisfied demand, then adding
l/d to equation (6), which gives:

(7) /w =

+ (l/u) + 1X (b/p)

+ at + y(l/d)

should drive S to zero. Columns (2), (3), (5), and (6) of Table 3
report coefficient estimates for equations with either the inverse
of the normalized help wanted index or the manufacturing quit rate
added to our augmented Phillips equations based on the official

unemployment rate. The point estimate of the time trend coefficient
remaining after either of these unsatisfied demand variables has
been introduced is either very close to zero or negative (in the

26

model with sixteen lagged inflation values to which the help wanted index
has been added); none of these estimated time trend coefficients is

statistically significant. The negative time trend in the model which
includes sixteen lagged inflation terms and the normalized help wanted index
might reflect the spurious increase in the level of the index relative to
the vacancy rate which we suspect may have occurred after 1973 or 1974.

In any event, the positive time trend in the augmented compensation
growth models with just the inverse of the official unemployment rate
but no unsatisfied demand variable does seem to disappear once some
control

for the level of unsatisfied demand has been introduced.

Qualitiatively similar results were obtained from augmented

Phillips

curve equations estimated based on the prime age male

unemployment rate. The augmented Phillips curve equation with four
lagged inflation terms presented in column (1) of Table 4 implies
an upward shift between 1956 and 1980 of 1.7 percentage points in
the annual rate of wage growth associated with any given unemployment

rate (coefficient statistically significant). The comparable model
with sixteen lagged inflation terms presented in column (4) implies
an upward shift of 0.7 percentage points (coefficient estimate not

significant). Thus, changes in the pattern of inflation would appear
to account for between 71 and 88 percent of the total shift in the
Phillips curve relation based on the prime age male rate of unemployment,
leaving an unexplained residual of between 12 and 29 percent of the total.
As was true with the official rate equations, adding an unsatisfied
demand variable to the augmented prime age male Phillips curve equations

seems to knock out the positive residual time trend. When the help
wanted index variable is introduced, the point estimates of the time trend

coefficents fall very near zero; adding the quit variable brings the
point estimates of the time trend coefficients down by roughly 60

percent. None of the time trend coefficients in the equations which
include an unsatisfied demand variable is statistically significant.
Taken as a whole, our econometric results seem supportive of
the proposition that a substantial fraction of the total observed
instability in the Phillips curve relations based on both the
official and the prime age male unemployment rates can be linked
to shifts in the relationships between those two variables and the
level of unsatisfied demand.

The Relative Stability of the Relationship Between_Unsatisfied
Demand and Compensation Growth

At this point the question might be asked whether the relationship
between unsatisfied demand (proxied by the help wanted index or the quit
rate) and the rate of growth in compensation has been more stable than

the relationship between unemployment and compensation growth. To answer
this question, we first estimated equations of the following form:

(8) i/w =

c + y(l/d) + 5t,

which is just like equation (4) except with an unsatisfied demand variable
(l/d) based on either the help wanted index or the manufacturing quit rate

substituted for the unemployment rate variable (1/u). The estimate of S
from the help wanted index regression indicates that the annual rate of

wage growth associated with any given value of that variable increased by
approximately 4.9 percentage points between 1956 and 1980; the estimate
of cS from the quit rate regression implies a comparable upward shift of

approximately 5.0 percentage points. These shifts are appreciably smaller
than the 6.1 percentage point shift estimated for the official unemployment
rate Phillips curve equation with no lagged inflation terms and the 5.7
percentage point shift estimated for the prime age male unemployment rate
Phillips curve equation with no lagged inflation terms.
Throughout this paper, we have focused primarily on compensation growth
equations which include a string of lagged inflation terms on the right hand

side. Models with an unsatisfied demand variable, a time trend and lagged
inflation terms:

(9) /w =

+ (l/d) + jlXj (/) + t

are presented in Table 5. In both the help wanted index and the quit rate
models with four lagged inflation values, the time trend coefficient has a

positive point estimate but is not significant. Where the significant
time trend coefficients in the comparable official and prime age male unemployment
rate equations implied upward shifts of 2.1 and 1.7 percentage points,
respectively, in the annual rate of inflation associated with given values
of those variables, the insignificant time trend coefficients in these help
wanted index and manufacturing quit rate equations imply smaller upward

shifts of 0. and 1.1 percentage points, respectively. In models which
include sixteen lagged inflation values, the time trend coefficient in
the help wanted index equation is slightly negative but not significant
and the time trend coefficient in the quit rate equation is extremely close to,

and not significantly different from, zero. The slightly negative or zero

implied

shifts in the help wanted index and quit rate equations with sixteen

lagged inflation terms compare to 1.2 and 0.7 percentage point upward shifts

in the analagous official and prime age male unemployment rate equations
respectively, as discussed above. In spite of the problems with our measures

of unsatisfied demand, the Phillips—type compensation growth equations
in Table 5 which contain an unsatisfied demand proxy rather than an
unemployment rate do appear to be relatively more stable than the comparable
equations in Table 3 and Table 4.

We noted earlier that the help wanted index and the manufacturing quit
rate are most certainly flawed measures of the level of unsatisfied demand

for labor in the economy as a whole. It seems plausible that compensation
growth equations estimated with a better unsatisfied demand variable, in
particular

a well measured job vacancy rate, should one become available,

might exhibit even greater stability. Unfortunately, we cannot test this
hypothesis at present.
The Sensitivity of Our Results

In

to Alternative_Specificaticns

order to determine whether the conclusions just reached were

robust with respect to alternative specifications, we reestimated the
equations in Tables 3, 4 and 5 in each of the various ways we had
previously reestimated the Table 1 and 2 equations, as described at the

end of the first section of the paper: with d or log d replacing l/d;
with the Perry weighted unemployment rate rather than the prime
age male unemployment rate; with the current and four lagged values of 1/u
and l/d instead of just the current value of each; with the three special
period dummy variables added to the original models; with overtime hours
added to all equations containing either the help wanted index or the quit

32

rate; with overtime hours used instead of the help wanted index or the quit
rate as our unsatisfied demand variable; and with lagged values of either
the implicit consumption deflator or the wholesale price index replacing

lagged values of the gross national product deflator. The conclusions
implied by these alternative sets of models were quite similar to the

conclusions implied by the results we originally presented: in all of
the models with four lagged inflation values and in all but one set with
sixteen lagged inflation values, the standard augmented Phillips curve
seemed to have shifted upwards over time, sometimes by substantially more
than in the models discussed in the text; introducing an unsatisfied
demand proxy into the standard Phillips equations always reduced the point
extimate of the time trend coefficient; and the equations with only
unsatisfied demand variables seemed for the most part to have been more
stable than those with only unemployment rates.

How should these results be interpreted? How do they relate to the
evidence presented in Section II? In the next section we discuss the interpretation of our findings.

III. Interpretation of findings

Thus far, we have presented empirical results without seriously

addressing the issue of their proper interpretation. In this section we
first lay out one plausible interpretation of our findings, that the
unemployment rate is a poor measure of the effective unutilized supply

of labor. We then discuss some of the potential reasons why the
relationship between measured unemployment and effective unutilized
labor supply has not been stable.

33

A Possible Explanation

Suppose the effective unsatisfied demand for labor and the effective
unutilized supply of labor to have been stably correlated with one another.
If the rate of growth in wages had been a stable function of effective
unsatisfied demand and/or effective unutilized supply (for example, the
rate of wage growth might depend of d —

s,

c d —

s, d alone or s alone,

where d represents effective unsatisfied demand and s effective unutilized
supply), then good measures of either variable should serve equally well

in wage growth regressions. One potential explanation of our findings
can be built on the premise that available unemployment rates do not
provide consistent measures of the effective unutilized labor supply.
In particular, it can be hypothesized that the effective unutilized
labor supply associated with any given unemployment rate has fallen
over time.

Why might there have been a divergence between the unemployment rate

and the effective unutilized supply of labor? Two sorts of possible
changes in the labor market suggest themselves as potentially relevant:
either the number of units of available labor represented by the typical
unemployed person may have fallen or the mismatch between the skills of
unemployed persons and the skills required to fill available jobs may
have become more serious over time.

What does it mean to say that the typical unemployed person might

represent fewer units of available labor today than previously? Examples
of the sort of problem we have in mind here include declines in the
average number of hours the unemployed wish to work per week or changes
in the attitudes of the unemployed so that they are less eager to secure

employment. In principle, one could deal with these problems by developing

34

an appropriate correction factor for each time period; the correct&i period

t unemployment rate would simply equal the raw

period

t unemployment

rate times the fraction of a typical base year unemployed person's
labor supply represented by the typical period t unemployed person. In
the absence of such a correction, the cited problems would be expected
lead to an increase in the amount of unsatisfied demand associated with
any given unemployment rate.

Alternatively, available unemployment rates might not represent
consistent measures of the effective unutilized labor supply because of

growth in the importance of structural imbalance. One might suppose
that the perceived availability of workers qualified to fill existing
jobs should be reflected in the difficulty which employers experience

in filling those jobs. To the extent that the piece of the unemployment
rate which captures what employers know about the potentially usable
unutilized labor supply is reflected in measures of unsatisfied demand,
the residual piece of the unemployment rate which is uncorrelated with
unsatisfied demand would tell us only about the amount of irrelavant
unutilized labor supply.

For either of the above sources of divergence between the unemployment
rate and the effective unutilized supply of labor to explain our results,
we must further suppose the normalized help wanted index and the manufacturing
quit rate to measure the effective unsatisfied demand for labor more
consistently than the unemployment rate measures the effective unutilized

supply of labor. The existence of greater total measurement error in the
unemployment rates we have used than in our unsatisfied demand proxies
would be consistent with our result that in wage growth equations which
include both, unsatisfied demand variables matter but unemployment rates

35

do not. A positive time trend in the error with which unemployment captures
the effective unutilized supply, that is, a decline in the effective
unutilized labor supply associated with any given level of unemployment,
could explain the positive time trend in estimated Phillips relationships.

Furthermore, if the trend in the measurement error in unemployment rates
is greater than the comparable trend in our unsatisfied demand proxies,
then a measurement error story could be used to explain the somewhat
greater stability of Phillips curves defined in terms of unsatisfied

demand proxies instead of unemployment rates. Most of our results can
thus be explained in terms of a simple time trend measurement error in

unemployment rates. However, a simple trend—related error could not
explain our finding that, even after a time trend is entered into wage
growth models, unsatisfied demand proxies still dominate unemployment

rates when both are present. To explain this result, one must further
suppose there to be some non—trend—related measurement error in unemployment
rates which is greater than the comparable error in our unsatisfied demand

measures. However, any non—trend—related error would not have to be just
noise. For example, a one—time shift in the meaning of the unemployment
rate as a measure of the effective unutilized labor supply would be
imperfectly captured by a simple time trend, leaving a non—trend—related
error component.

While the story we have just told seems plausible, a measurement
error interpretation of our results may be suspect insofar as it is easy
to believe that our unsatisfied demand proxies might be at least as poorly
measured as our indicators of unutilized labor supply, the official and

prime age male unemployment rates. As stated above, affirmative action
considerations and other factors are likely to have caused some upward

36

trend in the ratio of help wanted advertising to effective unsatisfied

labor demand. In addition, neither of our unsatisfied demand proxies
fully reflects all sectors of the economy. The help wanted index is
based on newspaper advertising and some types of job vacancies may be
more likely to be advertised than others; the quit rate we have used is

based on data for just the manufacturing sector. Any divergence between
the degree of effective unsatisfied demand for labor in the sectors
covered by our surrogates and the degree of effective unsatisfied demand for labor
in the economy as a whole would cause measurement error problems with

our proxies. For this reason, we are somewhat hesitant to assert that the
story given above offers the best possible explanation of our findings.

The

Shifting

Relationship Between Unsatisfied

Demand and Unemployment

Suppose it to in fact be true that the relationship between the
effective unsatisfied demand for labor and the effective unutilized supply
of labor has remained stable over time and that our unsatisfied demand
proxies provide consistent measures of the effective unsatisfied demand

for labor. Knowing why the relationship between our unsatisfied demand
proxies and unemployment has shifted outward should then tell us why the
unemployment rate has not been a consistent measure of the effective
unutilized supply of labor and thus why the unemployment rate is dominated

by measures of unsatisfied demand in wage growth equations. While we
cannot fully explain the observed outward shift in the relationship
between our unsatisfied demand proxies and unemployment, some of the
likely causes of the shift can be identified.

37

Readily available data can document that significant demographic
and unemployment insurance program changes have occurred in the United

States during the period we are studying)9 The proportion of the
labor force between 25 and 54 fell from a 1956 to 1960 average of 66

percent to a 1976 to 1980 average of 61 percent. Female labor force
participation grew so that women accounted for an average of 33 percent
of the total labor force during the 1956 to 1960 period and an average

of 42 percent during the 1976 to 1980 period. If the 1956 to 1960
period is compared to the 1976 to 1980 period, we observe that employment
covered under state unemployment insurance (UT) programs grew from an
average of 78 percent of non—federal civilian wage and salary workers to
an average of 93 percent, accompanied by a roughly constant average
potential duration of benefits for all UI claimants (23.5 weeks versus
23.2 weeks) and a slight increase in the ratio of average weekly UI

benefits to average weekly wages of covered employees (from .34 to •37)20
Unfortunately, hard data on other potentially important changes are not
so readily accessible.

Changes in the demographic composition of the labor force do seem to
have played an important role in shifting the relationship between our
unsatisfied demand variables and the official unemployment rate. As noted
before, the shifts in the plots of the unsatisfied demand proxies against
the prime age male unemployment rate appear to be less pronounced than the
shifts in the comparable official unemployment rate plots. To summarize
the magnitude of the shifts in these relationships, we estimated equations
of the following form:

(10) d =

38

where d represents either the normalized help wanted index or the manufacturing
quit rate, u represents either the official or the prime age male unemployment

rate and t is a time trend. The time trend coefficients imply that the shift of
the normalized help wanted index was approximately 32 percent smaller
against the prime age male unemployment rate than against the official
unemployment rate and that the shift of the manufacturing quit rate was
approximately 40 percent smaller against the prime age male unemployment
rate than against the official unemployment rate.

This would seem to

suggest that the changing age and sex structure of the labor force may
account for a substantial fraction of the shift in the official rate

curves. We also estimated a more complete set of models of the same
form

as

equation (10),

except

with u equal in turn to the official

unemployment rate, the prime age unemployment rate, and the prime age

male unemployment rate. The time trend coefficients from the male
(prime age male) unemployment rate curves were compared with those
from the official (prime age) unemployment rate curves to assess the
effect of changes in the sex structure of the labor face; the time
trend coefficients from the prime age (prime age male) unemployment
rate curves were held up against those from the official (male) unemployment
rate curves to gauge the impact of changes in the age structure of the

labor force. On the basis of these comparisons, it would appear that changes in
sex structure are associated with factors which can explain between one quarter
and one third, and changes in age structure with factors which can explain between
two thirds and three quarters, of the difference between the magnitude of the
outward shifts in the unsatisfied demand proxy/official unemployment rate curves
and the magnitude of the less pronounced outward shifts in the unsatisfied demand
proxy/prime age male unemployment rate curves.20

39

It is perhaps worth noting that shifts in the relationship between
unsatisfied demand and unemployment occurring because of changes in
demographic structure might reflect either a change in the number of
available units of labor represented by the typical unemployed individual

or increased structural imbalance. On the one hand, women, youth or
older persons might desire to work fewer hours per week or be less

committed to finding and keeping a job than others. On the other hand,
these people might simply be less likely to possess (or be perceived

by employers as less likely to possess) requisite job skills. To say
the same thing in a slightly different way, the elasticity of substitution
between prime age male workers and other workers might be infinite but
with a prime age male worker equivalant on average to a larger number
of effective labor units, or alternatively, the elasticity of substitution
between prime age males and others might be less than infinite.

It seems likely that changes in UI coverage and benefits may have
played a substantial role in shifting the relationship between unsatisfied

demand and measured unemployment. While an investigation for the U.S. has
not yet been completed, research for Canada and Great Britain has linked
outward shifts in those countries' Beveridge curves (which plot the
vacancy rate versus the unemployment rate) to changes in the relevant UI
laws.

2

Increased generosity of UI benefits is commonly supposed to affect

the eagerness of the typical unemployed worker to secure new employment.
Other factors, such as a growing mismatch between the requirements of
vacant jobs and the skills of the unemployed, even beyond what might have

been expected given observed demographic changes, appear likely to have
also played important roles in the phenomenon under discussion.23
Unfortunately, at this point we cannot document how large the role of each
of the potentially important factors might he,

Conclusions

and Directions

This paper has presented two key facts which call into question the
value of unemployment rates as barometers of labor market tightness.
First, while both unemployment rates and unsatisfied labor demand proxies
perform reasonably well on their own in compensation growth equations,
in models which include both, only the unsatisfied demand variable appears

to matter. Second, the past decade's outward shifts in Phillips plots
can to a substantial degree be tied to outward shifts in plots pairing

the relevant unemployment rate and unsatisfied demand proxies. We also
found that Phillips relationships which are defined in terms of unsatisfied
demand variables appear to be somewhat more stable than those using
unemployment rates.

Taken

together, our findings have a clear message for those concerned

with macroeconomic theory and policy: measures of emnlovers' unsatisfied
demand dominate unemployment rates as indicators of how labor market
conditions are likely to affect wage growth.

Before the 1970's, the choice between various indicators of
labor market tightness had little practical consequence, since the
relationship between unsatisfied demand proxies and unemployment

rates was so stable. Moreover, without some independent variation in
the potential tightness indicators, it was not possible to determine which

was "best." This all changed in the past ten years when relationships
between unsatisfied demand proxies and unemployment rates broke down in

many countries throughout the world. This event has allowed us to peek
inside the black box which links unemployment rates and compensation

growth. This glimpse has revealed that unemployment rates affect wage

41

growth only to the extent that they are correlated with unsatisfied labor
demand and has raised very basic questions about the whole wage growth
process.

For us to fully understand the determinants of wage growth in our

country, it would seem that the following queries must be addressed: How
exactly does a wage—setting unit determine the rate of wage growth? Which
factors are central and which are tangential in this process? What
information is available to those

determining wages? Does the shifting during

the past decade of the curves which link unsatisfied demand proxies and
unemployment rates reflect a diminished desire to work or growing

structural unemployment? Thus, it appears to us that an analysis of the
issues at hand has as a prerequisite the collection of new microdata.
This paper has demonstrated that labor market pressure on wages can

be more reliably assessed by looking at measures of unsatisfied labor
demand than by looking at the unemployment rates which have played the

key role in most earlier analyses. However, for now, our understanding
of the reasons for this finding must remain incomplete.

Nevertheless,

we are confident that the collection and analysis of microdata can lead
to a solution of this macro puzzle.

small semi—annual survey of economists. mong other questions, on each
survey occasion he has asked these economists what they anticipate the

level of the CPI and the WPI will be roughly 6 and 12 months later. Given
certain assumptions, these level forecasts can be converted into rate—of—

inflation forecasts. There are a number of problems with these predicted
rates of inflation, perhaps the most serious of which for our purposes
is that economists are hardly a random sample of the population.

4. Based on tenure data collected as part of the Current Population
Survey program, Robert Hall estimates that almost 60 percent of all
currently employed workers hold jobs which will end up lasting 5 years
or more and that nearly 30 percent hold jobs which will end up lasting

20 years or more. See Robert E. Hall, "The Importance of Lifetime Jobs in

Robert Solow, "The Behaviour of Help—Wanted Advertising", Review of

Economic Statistics, vol. 49 (February 1967), pp. 108—110. They
normalized with the civilian labor force rather than employment.

Our results are quite insensitive to the choice between these two
deflators.

we used is not at the time of this writing described in
print, although the Department of Commerce will soon publish
a volume describing the derivation of each element in the National

Accounts. Discussion with individuals at Commerce indicated that the
series was produced with wage and supplements information from various tax
forms, censuses, records of some private sector venders, and files of some

professional and trade associations. The total payroll hours data used
in converting these figures to hourly rates came from the "Monthly Report
on Employment, Payroll and Hours", which is discussed on pp. 26—42 of U.S.

9. We did estimate all of the models reported in the tables of this
paper without any serial correlation correction. The Durbin—Watson statistics
for these equations were often such that we could not readily determine
whether or not the presence of an autoregressive error process was indicated;

44

to be on the safe side, we chose to present models incorporating a serial

correlation correction. The parameter estimates in the corrected models
were very similar to those in the ordinary least squares models.

10. Throughout this paper, when we say a variable is statistically
significant, we mean that it has passed at least a .05 level one—tailed
test.

11. Earlier papers in which variables such as the manufacturing
quit rate, the manufacturing layoff rate or the help wanted index have
been substituted for the unemployment rate in wage growth models include
Sara Behman, "Wage Determination Process in U.S. Manufacturing",
Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 82 (February 1968), pp. 117—142;

Charles L. Schultze, "Has the Phillips' Curve Shifted? Some Additional
Evidence", Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2:1971, pp. 452—467; and
Martin N. Baily and James Tobin, "Macroeconomic Effects of Selective
Public Employment and Wage Subsidies", Brookings Papers on Economic

Activity, 2:1977, pp. 511—541. Each of the cited articles concludes that
the demand side variable or variables experimented with perform as well or

better than the unemployment rate in manufacturing sector (Behman)
or aggregate (Schultze, Baily and Tobin) wage growth equations. Although
Baily and Tobin also present results for different sectors of the economy,
these findings seem irrelevant for the present discussion since information
on help wanted advertising does not exist at the sectoral level.

12. The results presented in Table 2 are consistent with earlier
findings reported by Martin Baily and James Tobin. They estimated
several aggregate wage growth equations using quarterly data for 1958:1
through 1976:4 which included both an inverse unemployment rate variable

45
and

the

help wanted index deflated by total employment; while their

model specification is otherwise rather different from ours, they also
obtain generally insignificant wrong—signed unemployment coefficients
and strongly significant right—signed help wanted index coefficients.
Baily and Tobin also present similar equations for different sectors of the
economy; again, we would argue that these findings are not relevant for the
present

discussion since information on help wanted advertising does not

exist at the sectoral level. See Baily and Tobin, "Macroeconomic Effects
of

Selective Public Employment and Wage Subsidies."

in the intercept or changes in the slope. Here we consider shifts in
the intercept. For analyses suggesting that the United States' Phillips

to have been substantially less pronounced.

17. Schultze, "Has the Phillips' Curve Shifted? Some Additional
Evidence", looks at quit rate and official unemployment rate data for the

period 1952 through 1971. The article reports that the curve linking
these two rates seems to shift outwards in about 1966 and argues that
this points to a shift in the Phillips relationship likely having

occurred. This last 1960's shift is not obvious in our quit rate/official
unemployment rate plot in part because we omit the data points for 1952
through 1955 so as to be consistent with the time period covered by our
regression analysis and in part because the shift in the quit rate!
official unemployment rate relationship which occurred after 1969 was
much larger than any shift occurring during the late 1960's

19. Perry, "Changing Labor Markets and Inflation", was the first
to emphasize the importance of the growing proportion of women and
teenagers in the labor force in the context of understanding the
relationship between unemployment and wage growth.

20. The figures pertaining to the participation rates of teens and
women come from the relevant DRI data bank. The UI program statistics
were provided by the Employment and Training Administration.

21. Katharine Abraham is currently exploring a cross—section!
time—series data set which may shed additional light on the role played
by demographic changes in shifting the relationship between uisatisfied

demand and unemployment. Preliminary results seem supportive of the
proposition that changes in age structure have been more important than
changes in sex structure.

for example, Frank Reid and Noah M. Meltz, "Causes of

Shifts in the Unemployment—Vacancy Relationship: An Empirical Analysis

Vacancies", Appendix H, British Labour Statistics 1976 Yearbook, which
discuss the shifts in the Canadian and British Beveridge curves sources

are cited in these articles. The cross—section/time series data set
current being explored by Katharine Abraham may yield insight into the
role of unemployment insurance changes in explaining shifts in the
relationship between unsatisfied demand and unemployment in the United

States. Preliminary results seem to support the proposition that increases
in the percent of employment covered by unemployment insurance have played
an important role.
