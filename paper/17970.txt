Abstract
This paper considers discrete choice, with choice probabilities coming from maximization of preferences from a random utility field perturbed by additive location
shifters (ARUM). Any ARUM can be characterized by a choice-probability generating function (CPGF) whose gradient gives the choice probabilities, and every CPGF is consistent with an ARUM. We relate CPGF to multivariate extreme
value distributions, and review and extend methods for constructing CPGF for
applications. The choice probabilities of any ARUM may be approximated by a
cross-nested logit model. The results for ARUM are extended to competing risk
survival models.

choice set. A random utility model (RUM) associates a vector of random (from the
analyst’s viewpoint) utilities with the choice set alternatives, and postulates that
the choices of decision-makers maximize utility. If the distribution of the utility vectors is absolutely continuous, then it induces a unique multinomial choice
probability vector. This paper is concerned with determining necessary and sufficient conditions for a vector of choice probabilities to be consistent with a RUM.
This question is answered in conventional revealed preference theory (Samuelson,
1947; Houthakker, 1950; Richter, 1966) for choice sets that are economic budget
sets, and in the theory of stochastic revealed preference for finite choice sets (McFadden and Richter, 1990; McFadden, 2005). This paper adds to this literature by
showing that a multinomial choice probability vector is consistent with a RUM if
and only if it is the gradient of a choice probability generating function (CPGF)
with specified properties that can be checked in applications. This is the analogue
for discrete choice and the random utility model of the Antonelli et al. (1886) conditions in conventional economic demand analysis; see, for example, Mas-Colell
et al. (1995, 3H).
In Section 2, we consider multinomial choice probability vectors derived by
maximization of a random utility model (RUM), show that they can be obtained
as gradients (with respect to perturbation parameters) of choice probability generating functions (CPGF), and establish a necessary and sufficient characterization
of CPGF that can be checked in applications. The key step is to embed the base
RUM in an additive random utility model (ARUM), a random preference field in
which a vector of perturbations shifts the location of the random utility vector.
Mathematically, the CPGF is a transform of a multivariate probability distribution that is related to a multivariate Laplace transform, and retains exactly those
aspects of the distribution of utilities that are relevant for choice probabilities.
Section 3 considers the special case of RUM based on multivariate extreme
value (MEV) distributions. We define the exponent (EXP) of a multivariate CDF,
and show that the EXP has the properties of a CPGF if and only if the distribution
of utilities is multivariate extreme value (MEV). Rules are given that allow exponents to be combined into new exponents. This allows the combination of MEV
distributions into new MEV distributions. The associated copulas may be viewed
as generalizations of the Archimedian copula.
2

The mapping from MEV distributions to EXP is many-to-one, and MEV distributions that generate observationally distinct ARUM, and hence distinct CPGF,
can have the same EXP. Therefore, even though the EXP of a specific MEV distribution has the properties of a CPGF, it may not be the CPGF associated with this
particular MEV distribution. However, if a MEV that generates a particular EXP
satisfies an additional condition termed cross-alternative max-stability (CAMS),
then this MEV has marginal distributions that are extreme value type 1 distributed,
and a CPGF that coincides with the EXP. Put another way, if EXP is the exponent
of a MEV distribution, then there is another MEV distribution, not necessarily
observationally equivalent, that has extreme value type 1 marginals and the same
exponent EXP, and EXP is its CPGF. The family of CAMS MEV induce ARUM
that include the multinomial logit model, as well as generalizations such as the
nested logit model and the cross-nested logit model. This paper shows that the
choice probabilities of every ARUM may be approximated by a cross-nested logit
model. This shows that even though the set of ARUM from CAMS MEV is a
strict subset of all ARUM, it is in a sense dense in the set of all ARUM.
Section 4 extends some results relating CPGF and MEV to multiple risk survival models. Multiple risk survival models are similar to RUM, with duration
and cause of exit playing roles analogous to utility and choice. A difference is
that durations are positive and the smallest duration is observed, while utility has
no sign restriction and is not observed. The paper extends to the case of multiple
risk survival models the main results relating CPGF and MEV to RUM. Section 5
concludes the paper. Table 1 summarizes the acronyms used. All proofs are given
in the Appendix.

Random Utility Models for Finite Choice Sets

Suppose decision-makers face a finite set of alternatives indexed by a choice set
C = {1, . . . , J}. Decision-makers and alternatives may be described by explanatory variables, and the dependence of utilities on these variables may have structure derived from assumptions of economic rationality. We suppress these for the
current discussion, and reintroduce them later. We also initially suppress notation
for mixing of RUM. We consider utility to be random from our perspective.

Notation Let σ = (σ(1), . . . , σ(J)) denote a permutation of (1, ..., J), and let

∇σ:k F (u) ≡

Definition 1 A random utility model (RUM) is a vector U = (U1 , . . . , UJ ) of
latent random variables in RJ , with a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
R(u1 , . . . , uJ ) that is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure,
and has a density given by ∇1...J R(u1 , . . . , uJ ). A RUM induces an observable

Remark The definition of a RUM ensures that for any σ and k = 1, ..., J, the
derivative ∇σ:k R(u1 , . . . , uJ ) exists almost everywhere and is non-negative. It ensures for each j that the marginal CDF R(j) (uj ) = R(+∞, . . . , +∞, uj , +∞, . . . , +∞)
is absolutely continuous on R. It also ensures that the probability of ties is zero;

alternatives.

2.1

Embedding and Observational Equivalence

For any continuously differentiable increasing transformation r : R → R, which
may be stochastic, the image r(U ) ≡ (r(U1 ), . . . , r(UJ )) of a RUM U = (U1 , . . . , UJ )
is again a RUM with the same associated choice probability. Then the family of
such increasing transformations of a RUM defines an observationally equivalent
class. A representative can always be chosen from this equivalence class that has
E|Uj | finite for all j. For example,
(2)

Uj∗ = 1/(1 + exp(−Uj ))

has this property. Then, we will consider without loss of generality only RUM
representations that have finite means.
Definition 2 If U 0 = (U10 , . . . , UJ0 ) is a finite-mean RUM with CDF R(u1 , . . . , uJ ),
and choice probability PC0 (j), and m = (m1 , . . . , mJ ) ∈ RJ is a location vector,
then
(3)

U = (U1 , . . . , UJ ) = m + U 0

is again a finite-mean RUM with CDF R(u1 − m1 , . . . , uJ − mJ ), and choice
probability
(4) PC (j|m) = Pr(Uj ≥ Uk for k ∈ C) = Pr(Uj0 + mj ≥ Uk0 + mk for k ∈ C).
A family of RUM with finite means indexed by location vectors m is termed an
additive random utility model (ARUM).
5

Remark Obviously every RUM can be embedded in a ARUM, and recovered by
setting m = 0. Then, without loss of generality, we can represent a RUM as
an ARUM. Note that ARUM have been defined in previous literature as forms
Uj = mj + Uj0 that are the sum of a systematic component of utility mj and a
disturbance Uj0 . Our definition has the same mathematical structure, so that we
retain the name for this family, but we interpret the mj as location shifts from a
base RUM U 0 .
If a random vector W = (W1 , . . . , WJ ) has an absolutely continuous CDF
R(w1 , . . . , wJ ) with marginal CDF’s R(j) (wj ), and zj = sj (wj ) is a continuously
differentiable increasing transformation with an (also continuously differentiable)
inverse wj = Sj (zj ), then Z = (Z1 , . . . , ZJ ) = (s1 (W1 ), . . . , sJ (WJ )) has a
CDF F (z1 , . . . , zJ ) = R(S1 (z1 ), . . . , SJ (zJ )), and conversely R(w1 , . . . , wJ ) =
F (s1 (w1 ), . . . , sJ (wJ )). The associated densities are related by

∇1...J R(w1 , . . . , wJ ) = ∇1...J F (s1 (w1 ), . . . , sJ (wJ ))

where the product in this expression is the Jacobian of the nonlinear transformation. In particular, the transformation Zj = rj (Wj ) ≡ ψ −1 (R(j) (Wj )), where
ψ is a continuously differentiable increasing univariate CDF whose support is a
bounded or unbounded interval Ψ ∈ R, defines a random vector Z ∈ ΨJ with a
CDF F (z1 , . . . , zJ ) whose univariate marginals are ψ(zj ) for each j. The transformation zj = sj (wj ) can in general depend on observed and stochastic variables,
and unknown parameters, and when this is the case, the probability statements
above are interpreted as conditioned on these factors.
Definition 3 A finite-mean family of RUM defined implicitly by εj = rj (Uj −
mj ), where rj is a continuously differentiable increasing transformation with a
continuously differentiable inverse, ε = (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) has an absolutely continuous
CDF F (ε), and m = (m1 , . . . , mJ ) is a location vector, is termed a finite-mean
transformed additive random utility model (TARUM).
Define ζj ≡ rj−1 (εj ) and ζ = (ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ). Then Uj = mj + ζj is a finite-mean
ARUM with a CDF R(U −m) ≡ F (r(U −m)) that is absolutely continuous, with
r(U −m) = (r1 (U1 − m1 ), . . . , rJ (UJ − mJ )), and this ARUM is observationally
6

equivalent to the TARUM.
Lemma 1 The choice probability associated with a TARUM satisfies

Remark Requiring that a representation of a RUM have finite mean implies that
the random vector ζ has a finite mean; this does not require that ε has a finite
mean. The primary interest in TARUM is that the nonlinear transformations rj can
absorb dependence of stochastic terms on explanatory variables and the effects of
heteroskedasticity, so that ε is clear of these application-specific effects. Suppose
an ARUM with an absolutely continuous CDF R(u1 − m1 , . . . , uJ − mJ ) and
marginal CDF’s R(j) , and define εj = rj (Uj − mj ) ≡ ψ −1 (R(j) (Uj − mj )),
where ψ is a continuous increasing univariate CDF. Then ε = (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) has
a CDF F (ε) with specified univariate marginals ψ. TARUM include Box-Cox
transformations such as

r(Ui − mi ) = 1 − e−λ(Ui −mi ) /λ,
polynomials such as
r(Ui − mi ) =

K
X

ak (Ui − mi )2k−1

k=1

with ak ≥ 0, and other transformations of location and scale, and r can also
be a function of observed explanatory variables and latent stochastic vectors that
capture taste heterogeneities.

7

Remark In a TARUM εj = rj (Uj − mj ) where ε = (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) has a CDF F (ε),
choice probabilities PD (j|m) from a non-empty subset D of C are obtained by first
forming the marginal distribution of the components of ε associated with alternatives in D, and then applying (6) using this distribution. Equivalently, PD (j|m) is
obtained from PC (j|m) by setting mk = −∞ for k 6∈ D.
Together, the definitions and remarks above establish that every RUM has a
representation that can be embedded in an ARUM with finite mean, or an observationally equivalent TARUM whose univariate marginals are a specified continuous
increasing univariate CDF ψ.

2.2

Choice Probability Generating Functions

This section defines a class of choice-probability generating functions (CPGF)
with specific properties. The main result shows that every TARUM has an associated CPGF whose first derivatives are the choice probabilities of the TARUM,
and conversely that every function with the specific properties is the CPGF associated with an ARUM. Thus, an observationally equivalent family of RUM are
fully characterized by an associated CPGF.
Definition 4 A function g on [0, +∞)J has the Alternating Signs Property (ASP)
if for any permutation σ of (1, . . . , J) and k = 1, . . . , J, the signed mixed derivatives
(−1)k−1 ∇σ:k g(y1 , . . . , yJ )
exist, are independent of the order of differentiation, and are non-negative.
Definition 5 A choice-probability generating function (CPGF) is an extended
non-negative function G : [0, +∞]J → [0, +∞] with the properties:
[G1] (Weak ASP) ln G(y) satisfies the ASP, so that for any permutation σ of
(1, . . . , J) and k = 1, . . . , J, its mixed partial derivatives are independent

Remark The gradient PC (j|m) = ∂ ln G(em )/∂mj ≡ χj (m) is the choice probability generated by the CPGF G, with [G1] and [G2] ensuring that the probability
is non-negative and sums to one. An implication of [G2] is that
χσ:k (m − c) ≡ χσ:k (m)
for any scalar c.

satisfy [G1].
Theorem 1 If εj = rj (Uj −mj ) is a finite-mean TARUM in which ε = (ε1 , . . . , εJ )
has CDF F (ε) and U = (U1 , . . . , UJ ) has finite mean, and an observationally equivalent ARUM is Uj = mj + ζj with ζ = (ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ) having CDF
R(ζ) ≡ F (r(U − m)), where r(U − m) = (r1 (U1 − m1 ), . . . , rJ (UJ − mJ )),

exists and satisfies [G1]-[G4]. The choice probability implied by the TARUM
satisfies
(13)

PC (j|m) = Pr(Uj > Uk for k 6= j) = ∂ ln G(em )/∂mj .

Conversely, if G is a function satisfying properties [G1]-[G4], then there exists an
ARUM such that G is an associated CPGF and (13) holds.

Since ARUM-consistent choice probabilities are obtained from a gradient of a
CPGF, the properties of choice probabilities with this property are easily derived
from the properties [G1]-[G4] of a CPGF. Further, it is straightforward to show
that these specific properties of choice probabilities are sufficient for ARUMconsistency by integrating back to obtain the associated CPGF. The following
corollary gives this result.
Corollary 1 A choice probability PC (j|m) on C = {1, . . . , J} is consistent with
a finite-mean TARUM if and only if it is non-negative, sums to one, and satisfies

Prior literature: McFadden (1981) proves a theorem, attributed to Williams
(1977) and Daly and Zachary (1978), that utilizes an economic argument to establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which RUM models with additive
income terms in their utilities can be characterized equivalently in terms of a social surplus function whose gradient gives the choice probabilities. Theorem 1 and
Corollary 1 use related arguments with location parameters m in place of income,
11

and obtain similar but more complete results, without restrictive economic conditions on utility. Papers that deal with the relationship between characterization of
choice models and integrability conditions in economic demand theory are Bates
(2003), Ibáñez (2007), Ibáñez and Batley (2008), Koning and Ridder (2003), and
McFadden (2005). Papers that deal with choice-probability generating functions
for nested logit and what econometricians term generalized extreme value models
are McFadden (1978), Daly and Bierlaire (2006) and Bierlaire et al. (2008). A
paper that considers mixing of choice models is McFadden and Train (2000).

2.3

Mixing of CPGF

Suppose a TARUM εj = rj (Uj − mj , α) in which ε = (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) has CDF
F (ε) and α is a latent mixing vector, independent of ε, with density K(α). The
usual interpretation of α is that it indexes the tastes of heterogeneous consumers.
Let G(em , α) denote the CPGF, which is measurable as a function of α, and
PC (j|m, α) = ∂G(em , α)/∂mj the choice probability associated with the TARUM
given α. Then there is an observationally equivalent mixed ARUM Uj = mj +
ζj with ζ having a CDF R(ζ|α) given α, or an unconditional CDF R(ζ) =
R
R(ζ|α)K( dα). The associated choice probabilities are the corresponding mixR
tures PC (j|m) = PC (j|m, α)K( dα); these are obviously RUM-consistent. A
simple sum log formula gives the CPGF for this mixed model:
(17)

m

ln G(e ) =

Z

ln G(em , α)K( dα).

It has a gradient that gives the mixed choice probabilities. It is easy to verify
that a mixture of logs of functions G(em , α) that satisfy [G1]-[G4] is the log of a
function that again satisfies these conditions, and hence is a CPGF for the mixed
model. This result can be used together with the results of McFadden and Train
(2000) that every regular RUM can be approximated as closely as one pleases by
some mixture of logit models (or other base models such as independent probit);
the corresponding sumlog mixture of the CPGF for the base model will give the
RUM-consistent CPGF corresponding to the approximating probabilities.

2.4

Economic Variables and Economic Rationality

Suppose consumers are rational economic decision-makers that seek maximum
utility through discrete and continuous consumption choices. Let j ∈ C denote the set of discrete alternatives, and tj denote the cost of alternative j. Let
x ∈ X denote a continuous consumption vector, and let p denote a corresponding price vector. Let y denote income. Then, the consumer with a utility function u(x, j) will solve maxj∈C maxx∈X u(x, j) subject to the budget constraint
p0 x ≤ y − tj , where the right-hand-side is the consumer s discretionary income
after paying for discrete alternative j. The solution to the inner maximization,
Uj (p, y − tj ) = maxx∈X {u(x, j)|p0 x ≤ y − tj }, is termed indirect utility conditioned on j. The indirect utility function is homogeneous of degree zero and
quasiconvex in (p, y − tj ), increasing in y − tj , and non-increasing in p, and any
function with these properties induces a utility function u(x, j) = inf p Uj (p, p0 x)
for which Uj is the associated indirect utility function; cf. Diewert (1974), McFadden (1974),Varian (1993, Sect. 7.2). The indirect utility Uj may vary over
a population due to heterogeneity in tastes, and in addition to its dependence on
(p, y − tj ), it may depend on other variables Xj that include attributes of the discrete alternative and factors that influence tastes, such as age and family size. The
economic rationality requirement of consumer sovereignty, under which tastes are
determined and invariant with respect to the economic budget the consumer faces,
requires that any latent taste factors in Uj have distributions that are independent
of the budget (p, y − tj ). In a well-specified economically rational TARUM, this
corresponds to a specification εj = rj (Uj − mj , p, y − tj , Xj ) in which the vector
of random taste factors ε = (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) has CDF F (ε) that is independent of
(p, y − tj ). For this TARUM to define an indirect utility function satisfying the
homogeneity, quasiconvexity, and monotonicity requirements of economic rationality, rj (Uj − mj , p, y − tj , Xj ) must be increasing in Uj − mj , homogeneous of
degree zero and quasiconcave in (p, y − tj ), non-decreasing in p, and decreasing
in y.
Our specification of economically rational TARUM in which the location parameters mj are independent of economic variables appears incompatible with
the common practice of introducing dependence on income and prices through a

13

“systematic” utility component mj . However, the TARUM transformation rj may
include an additional quasiconcave function of discretionary income and prices
that is additive to mj and plays the conventional role. For example, the transformation
(18) rj (Uj − mj , p, y − tj , Xj , α) =
ν(Uj − mj − [(y − tj )/a(p)]1−η /(1 − η) + bj (p, Xj , α)/a(p))
with ν an increasing transformation, a(p) and bj (p, Xj , α) concave linear homogeneous nondecreasing functions of p, η 6= 1 a positive parameter, and α a latent
stochastic taste factor, defines a useful class of indirect utility functions, called
the generalized Gorman preference field (Gorman, 1953), that allow discrete responses to depend on income level and on the prices of continuous goods.

important for applications are consistent with finite-mean RUM that have multivariate extreme value (MEV) distributions; see McFadden (1974) and McFadden
(1978). In this section, we summarize selected results from the statistical theory
of MEV distributions that allow us to relate MEV-RUM families to the general
characterization of finite-mean RUM-consistent CPGF and choice probabilities
given in Theorem 1 and its corollary.
Definition 6 If F (ε) is an absolutely continuous CDF on RJ with univariate
marginals F(j) (εj ), and copula

C(u1 , . . . , uJ ) = F (F(1)

on [0, 1]J , define the function A : [0, +∞]J → [0, +∞] by
(19)

A(y1 , . . . , yJ ) ≡ − ln C(e−y1 , . . . , e−yJ ),

and term A the exponent of C or equivalently of F ; then
(20)

C(u1 , . . . , uJ ) = e−A(− ln u1 ,...,− ln uJ )

and
(21)

F (ε) = e−A(− ln F(1) (ε1 ),...,− ln F(J) (εJ )) .

Remark The exponent of a multivariate CDF is not in general an associated
CPGF, but we will later establish an equivalence that when F is a multivariate
extreme value distribution then A is in fact a CPGF, satisfying the conditions
[G1]-[G4] and generating the choice probabilities for a TARUM based on F . The
exponent of a multivariate distribution is determined solely by its copula, independent of its univariate marginals. Hence, the mapping from multivariate distributions to exponents is many-to-one, with the inverse image of a given exponent
being the family of all multivariate distributions with the same copula and various
univariate marginals.
The following mathematical results will be used to obtain the features of the
exponent of a CDF, and its relation to CPGF.
Definition 7 A real-valued function ψ of a scalar t is completely monotonic if, for
k = 1, 2, . . . ,
(22)

(−1)k−1 ∂ k ψ(t)/∂tk ≥ 0.

Examples of completely monotonic functions (see Miller and Samko, 2001) are:
• ln(α + βt), with α + βt > 0 and β > 0;
• tα , with t ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1;
• −e−αt , with α ≥ 0;
15

• −1/t, with t < 0.
Lemma 2 If a real-valued function g on [0, +∞)J satisfies ASP from Definition 4,
and if ψ is completely monotonic on a domain that includes the range of g, then
ψ(g) satisfies ASP.
Corollary 2 If A : [0, +∞]J → [0, +∞] satisfies ASP, then
• ln A satisfies ASP;
• αA satisfies ASP if α > 0;
• Aα satisfies ASP if 0 < α ≤ 1;
Corollary 3 If A1 : [0, +∞]J → [0, +∞] and A2 : [0, +∞]J → [0, +∞] satisfies
ASP, then
• αA1 + βA2 satisfies ASP if α, β ≥ 0;
• A1 A2 satisfies ASP;
Lemma 3 If A : [0, +∞]J → [0, +∞] is the exponent of an absolutely continuous
CDF F (ε), then A satisfies [G3], and satisfies ASP and therefore [G1].
√
√
Remark The function G(y1 , y2 ) = y1 + 2y2 2y1 + y2 satisfies [G1] (i.e., ASP
for ln G), but not ASP for G. Then, ASP for G is strictly stronger than [G1].
Definition 8 Let ε ∈ RJ be a random vector with CDF F (ε) and let mn ≡
W
W
W
k≤n εk = ( k≤n εk1 , . . . , k≤n εkJ ) be the component-wise maximum of independent draws ε1 , . . . , εn from F . Then ε is location/scale max-stable if there are
location and scale parameter vectors, µ(n) and σ(n) respectively, such that the
CDF of mn is F ((mn1 − µ1 (n))/σ1 (n), . . . , (mnJ − µJ (n))/σJ (n)).

Remark By the Fisher - Tippet - Gnedenko theorem, any max-stable univariate
distribution belongs to the GEV family (Joe, 1997). The distribution H(ε; 0, µ, σ)
is known as the type 1 extreme value (EV1) or Gumbel distribution, which has
mean µ + σγ, where γ is Euler’s constant. When ξ > 0, H(ε; ξ, µ, σ) is called
type 2 extreme value or Fréchet. When ξ < 0, H(ε; ξ, µ, σ) is called type 3
extreme value or reverse Weibull.
Definition 10 Let ε ∈ RJ be a random vector with CDF F (ε). Then ε is termed
multivariate extreme value (MEV) if it is location/scale max-stable. The univariate
marginals of a MEV distribution must be in the GEV family just defined.1
A max-stable CDF F (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) must then satisfy

This demonstrates the following result:
Lemma 4 (Joe, 1997) F (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) is a MEV distribution if and only if its copula
C satisfies the homogeneity condition
(24)

C(u1 , . . . , uJ )λ = C(uλ1 , . . . , uλJ )

1
We follow the statistics literature in naming the univariate family H(ε; ξ, µ, σ) the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution; the econometrics literature often uses the term GEV for
MEV distributions. Characterization of univariate max-stable distributions dates to Fisher and
Tippett (1928), Gnedenko (1943), and Gumbel (1958); see also Johnson et al. (1995). Joe (1997)
and Coles (2001) give detailed treatments of multivariate max-stable distributions. When transformations other than location and scale are allowed, the family of max-stable distributions has
additional members; see Sreehari (2009).

Remark If C(u1 , . . . , uJ ) is the copula of any multivariate CDF F (ε1 , . . . , εJ ),
then other multivariate distributions with the same copula can be obtained by substituting different univariate marginal distributions into the copula. In particular,
if C is the copula of a MEV distribution F (ε1 , . . . , εJ ), so that C has the homogeneity property in Lemma 4, then

F ∗ (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) = C e−e 1 , . . . , e−e J
is a MEV distribution with the same copula and EV1 univariate marginals with
location parameters zero and scale parameters 1. We will term these MEV1 distributions.
Combined with the definition (19) of the exponent of a distribution, Lemma 4
gives the following result:
Lemma 5 If A : [0, +∞]J → [0, +∞] is the exponent of an absolutely continuous
CDF F (ε), then A satisfies [G2] if and only if F is max-stable.
Not all multivariate max-stable distributions have the property that vectors of
cross-alternative maxima are max-stable. For example, F (ε1 , ε2 ) = H(ε1 ; 0, 0, 1)H(ε2 ; 0, 0, 2)
implies that M = max(ε1 , ε2 ) has the CDF Pr(M ≤ m) = exp(−e−m − e−m/2 ),
which is not a max-stable distribution.
Definition 11 A multivariate max-stable distribution F (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) is cross-alternative
max-stable (CAMS) if for every j, k, max(εj + mj , εk + mk ) is max-stable for all
location-shift parameters mj , mk .
The following result gives the condition under which max-stability is preserved under cross-alternative maximization.
Lemma 6 Suppose F (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) is max-stable. F is CAMS if and only if the
univariate marginals of F are EV1 with a common scale parameter σ.

18

Remark Thus any MEV1 distribution is CAMS. As noted in a previous remark,
a MEV1 distribution can be created from the copula of any MEV distribution
together with EV1 univariate marginals with a common scale parameter.

CPGF and CAMS MEV

We will show that a random utility model characterized by an ARUM Uj = mj +ζj
with a CDF R(ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ), or an observationally equivalent TARUM, has a CPGF
given by the exponent of R if and only if R is a CAMS MEV. If R is MEV but
not CAMS, then its exponent is a CPGF for another ARUM, not observationally
equivalent, that is CAMS with the same copula. We state the conditions on a
CPGF, or on a choice probability, that are necessary and sufficient for them to be
associated with a cross-alternative max-stable ARUM. We tie these results to the
analysis by McFadden (1978) and Smith (1984) of choice probabilities derivable
from “generalized extreme value” models.
The following two assumptions are stronger than the parallel assumptions [G1]
and [CP1], and are used to establish that a candidate CPGF G : [0, +∞]J →
[0, +∞], or a choice probability PC (j|m), is consistent with a CAMS ARUM:
[G1*] (Strong ASP) G(y) satisfies ASP.
[CP1*] For j 6= k, ∂PC (j|m)/∂mk = ∂PC (k|m)/∂mj . For k = 1, . . . , J − 1
and permutation σ satisfying σ(J) = j, the test functions Tσ:k (m), defined
recursively by
• Tσ(1) (m) = PC (j|m) and,
19

• for k > 1, Tσ:k+1 (m) = Tσ:k (m)Tσ(k+1) (m) + ∂Tσ:k (m)/∂mk+1 ,
satisfy
(−1)k−1 Tσ:k (m) ≥ 0.
Theorem 2 Suppose A : [0, +∞]J → [0, +∞] is the exponent of a multivariate
CDF R(ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ). Then, A satisfies [G3], and [G1*] and hence [G1]. Second,
A satisfies [G2] if and only if R(ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ) is MEV. Third, A is a CPGF for the
ARUM Uj = mj +ζj with a MEV CDF R(ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ) if and only if R(ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ) is
CAMS, but any A satisfying [G1*], [G2], and [G3] is a CPGF for an ARUM Uj =
mj +νj with the CAMS MEV R̃(ν1 , . . . , νJ ) = exp(−A(exp(−ν1 ), . . . , exp(−νJ ))).
In these results, [G4] is implied by [G1*], [G2], and [G3]. In general, the ARUM
Uj = mj + ζj and Uj = mj + νj are not observationally equivalent.
Remark Suppose R is a CDF corresponding to a RUM and that R is MEV. By
the remarks in Section 2.1, this has a representation that is embedded in an observationally equivalent TARUM with EV1 marginals. This TARUM is MEV and
hence it is also CAMS MEV.
If one requires cross-alternative max-stability in the presence of scale shifts
rather than location shifts, one finds that Weibull univariate marginals with a common shape parameter ξ < 0 and location parameter µ = 0 are CAMS for the
family of scale shifts. This does not create a new family of ARUM and CPGF, as
one is obtained from the other by a log transformation of utility. This is utilized
in section 4 on survival models.

,

with G given by (25).
Prior literature Building on Strauss (1979) and Robertson and Strauss (1981),
Lindberg et al. (1995) discuss ARUM that have the property of invariance of
achieved utility (IAU). This property states that the distribution of utility conditional on choosing alternative j is independent of j. They show that this class
of models coincides with the class of models where the CDF of utility has the
form F (x) = φ(G(exp(−x))), where G satisfies [G2] (homogeneity). See also
de Palma and Kilani (2007)
Remark It is straightforward to establish that the CPGF corresponding to such
a distribution is in fact G, that G satisfies strong ASP, and that any ARUM with
the IAU property is observationally equivalent to a CAMS ARUM. Admissible
functions φ may be constructed as Laplace transforms of random variables, see
Joe (1997, pp. 204). In this case, F may be viewed as a power mixture of a
MEV distribution or equivalently as the distribution obtained from adding the
same random variable to all utilities in a MEV distribution. This has no effect on
choice probabilities. In the converse direction, one may use that a function ψ on
[0, ∞[ is the Laplace transform of a random variable if and only if ψ is completely
monotonic and ψ(0) = 0 (Nelsen, 2006, Lemma 4.6.5). The copula corresponding
to F (x) = φ(G(exp(−x))) is φ(G(φ−1 (u))). The case G (y) = y1 + ... + yJ
corresponds to the Archimedean copula (Nelsen, 2006). In the case of a general
CPGF G, the corresponding copula may thus be called a generalized Archimedean
copula.

3.3

An Approximation Result

This section establishes a constructive way to approximate any ARUM by a certain type of MEV ARUM. It is known that any RUM may be approximated arbitrarily well by a MEV model. This section will show that the choice probabilities
21

of any ARUM, Ui = mi + εi , may be approximated arbitrarily well by the choice
probabilities of a MEV model from the nested logit family, for m in a compact set.
In fact, the approximating type of model is a cross-nested logit model (Vovsha,
1997; Bierlaire, 2006). The proof of this combines a theorem by Dagsvik (1995)
and its proof with the following Lemma.
Lemma 9 Let µ be a finite measure on RJ . Let {gk } by a finite set of continuous
and µ−integrable functions from RJ to R. Let K ⊂ RJ be a compact set. Then

We shall now review Theorem 1 in Dagsvik (1995). Dagsvik’s theorem applies to general random utility. Here we specialize the result to the additive case
Ui = mi + εi , where ε follows some general multivariate distribution with CDF
F. This means that the mapping from m to the CDF of U is continuous. The corresponding choice probabilities are P F (j|m). Dagsvik assumes that there exists
a small ā > 0 such that 0 < Eeaεj < ∞ for any j and any 0 < a < ā.
Dagsvik defines MEV (and calls it GEV) from functions A that satisfy limits and strong signs but a−homogeneity and not just 1-homogeneity. The degree of homogeneity is not important for us, as a MEV ARUM based on an
a−homogeneous A is observationally equivalent to a MEV ARUM based on A1/a ,
which is 1-homogeneous. Then Dagsvik proves the following theorem.
Theorem 3 (Dagsvik, 1995) For any compact K and for any δ > 0 there exists a
MEV model with corresponding CDF F̃ (u − m) such that
sup P F̃ (j|m) − P F (j|m) < δ.
m∈K

The proof works by constructing a MEV model that tends to the true model
at any m ∈ K. Since K is compact, convergence is uniform over K. The MEV
CDF is constructed as follows.

This expression tends to P F (j|m) as a tends to 0. Combining this with Lemma
9 is sufficient to prove the following theorem.

corresponding CDF F̂ (u − m) such that

Multiple Risk Survival Models

There is a close connection between random utility models and multiple risk survival models. This section explores this link.
Definition 12 A survival model (SM) is a vector exp (−ε) = exp (−ε1 , ..., −εJ )
of positive latent durations in RJ where ε has an absolutely continuous CDF
R and E |ε| < ∞. The minimum duration exp (−ε0 ) = minj exp (−εj ) is observed and induces an observable survival function S (t) = P (exp (−ε0 ) > t) =
R (− ln t, ..., − ln t) .
When ε0 = εj , say that exit occurs for the j 0 th cause. The cause is considered
observable in some applications.
23

As in the RUM, the CDF R of latent durations may depend on observed and
unobserved covariates. This notation is suppressed in the following. The CDF R
is not identified in general without further assumptions (Kalbfleisch and Prentice,
2002). This motivates the following definition.
Definition 13 If exp (−ε) = exp (−ε1 , ..., −εJ ) is a SM and m ∈ RJ is a location
vector, then t = exp (− (m + ε)) , where the minimum duration T0 = minj Tj
is observed, is again a SM with survival function S (t|m) = R (− (m + ln t)) .
A family of SM indexed by the location vector m is termed an additive survival
model (ASM). Note that R is now identified from S(t|m) since R(−m) = S(1|m).
Remark These models may also be termed multivariate accelerated failure time
models (Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 2002).
Theorem 5 If t = exp (− (m + ε)) is an ASM, then an associated CPGF defined
by
(27)

ln G (em ) = −E (ln T0 |m)

exists and satisfies properties [G1]-[G4]. The probability of exit for cause j is
given by
(28)

P (j|m) =

∂ ln G (em )
.
∂mj

Conversely, if G is a function satisfying properties [G1]-[G4], then there exists a
ASM such that (27) and (28) hold.
Definition 14 An ASM has an exponential survival function if the hazard does not
depend on t. The ASM is termed exponential in this case. The ASM has proportional hazard if the hazard factors as λ(t|m) = A (em ) λ0 (t).
Theorem 6 Consider an ASM t = exp(−(m+ε)) with CPGF G (em ) = exp (−E (ln T0 |m)) .
Then ε is CAMS MEV if and only if the ASM is exponential. In this case, the hazard A (em ) is equal to the CPGF A (em ) = G (em ) .
Theorem 7 Any proportional hazard ASM is exponential.

Conclusion

This paper has contributed by completely characterizing the relationship between
RUM and CPGF without imposing structure on utility. Furthermore, the paper has
contributed by completely characterizing the subset of MEV ARUM in terms of
CPGF and also the further subset of CAMS MEV ARUM in terms of CPGF. The
subset of CAMS MEV ARUM consisting of cross-nested logit models is dense
in the set of all RUM. The main results are extended to the case of multiple risk
survival models. The present results generalize and subsume a range of previous
contributions.

Proof of Theorem 1. Consider first sufficiency. Assume that εj = rj (Uj − mj )
is a TARUM and ε = (ε1 , . . . , εJ ) has CDF F (ε). Let Uj = mj + ζj with ζ =
(ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ) having CDF R(ζ) be an observationally equivalent ARUM.
Consider [G1]: The requirement that the TARUM have finite mean utility

implies that UC = maxj∈C Uj has E|UC | ≤ Jj=1 E|Uj | < ∞. Then ln G(em ) ≡
E[UC ] exists. Then, integrating by parts,

This completes the demonstration of [G4].
Next, the converse proposition in the theorem will be proved. Assume that
G(em ) is a function satisfying properties [G1]-[G4]. Let χσ:J (m) be the mixed
derivative of ln G(em ) from (7), and let η be any continuous density on R with
a finite mean. Consider an ARUM Uj = mj + ζj in which ζ = (ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ) is

the transformation w = u − (m1 + Jj=2 zj )/J; and in [c] we use the condition
from [G4] that χ1 (z) is zero when any component of (z2 , . . . , zJ ) equals +∞.
Note that the density η introduces a factor that is common to all utilities and has
no effect on the choice probabilities. The result above holds for any permutation
of the indices. Thus, G(em ) is a choice-probability generating function for the
ARUM Uj = mj + ζj , completing the proof of the theorem.
Proof of Corollary 1. Given a finite-mean TARUM, let G be an associated
CPGF. Properties [G1]-[G4] of G, translated to statements about PC (j|m) =
∂G(em )/∂mj , become properties [CP1]-[CP4]. Then, by the theorem, [CP1][CP4] are necessary for RUM-consistent choice probabilities.

= PC (k|m1 , . . . , mk , . . . , mJ ).
Then G generates the given choice probability. The proof is completed by showing
that G defined by (46) satisfies [G1]-[G4]. The argument above establishes that
χj (m) ≡ PC (j|m) ≥ 0. Then [CP1] implies [G1]. From (47),

and hence by Euler’s theorem that G satisfies [G2]. Conditions [G3] and [G4] follow from [CP3] and [CP4] by noting that χj (m) ≡ PC (j|m). Then, the candidate
CPGF G satisfies [G1]-[G4] and generates the given choice probability.

where ψ (i) (t) = ∂ i ψ(t)/∂ti and Aiσ:k is the set of all partitions of (σ(1), . . . , σ(k))
into i non-empty subvectors. This formula can be verified by induction. The ASP
follows by induction, since differentiation of a term in (48) leads to new terms, all
having the opposite sign of the original term.
Proof of Lemma 2. From Lemma 2 and the fact that ψ(t) = ln(t), ψ(t) = αt
and ψ(t) = tα are completely monotonic for t > 0.
Proof of Lemma 3. The results comes from Lemma 2 and the properties of
completely monotonic (c.m.) functions that a linear combination of c.m. functions with non-negative multipliers is also c.m., and that the product of two c.m.
functions is also c.m.
Proof of Lemma 3. Consider the construction A(y) = − ln C(e−y ). Computation shows that −C(e−y ) satisfies ASP, that ψ1 (t) = −1/t is completely monotonic for t < 0, and that ψ2 (t) = ln t is completely monotonic for t > 0. Then by
Lemma 2, the composition A(y) = ψ2 (ψ1 (−C(e−y )) satisfies ASP. Then, Corollary 2 implies that ln A(y) satisfies ASP, and hence [G1]. The boundary conditions C(1) = 1 and C(u1 , . . . , uj−1 , 0, uj+1 , . . . , uJ ) = 0 for each j imply that A
satisfies [G3].

Proof of Lemma 5. A(y) = − ln C(e−y ) implies A(λy) = − ln C (e−y )λ =
− ln C(e−y )λ = λA(y).

Conversely, if max(εj + mj , εk + mk ) is max-stable, then for some max-stable
univariate distribution H(ε; ξ, µ, σ),
(50)

Pr (max(εj + mj , εk + mk ) ≤ m) =

The homogeneity of A implies that

H(m − mi ; ξi , µi , σi )

The first finite argument of A is independent of m for more than one value of
mj if and only if ξ = ξj = 0 and σ = σj . Since A is increasing in each of its finite
arguments for some range of location shifts, both arguments must be independent
of m, requiring that ξ = ξj = ξk = 0 and σk = σj .
Proof of Theorem 2. Lemma 3 establishes that the exponent of R satisfies [G3],
[G1*], and hence [G1]. Lemma 5 establishes that A satisfies [G2] if and only if
R is MEV. Lemma 6 establishes that A is a CPGF for the ARUM Uj = mj + ζj

37

with a MEV CDF R(ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ) if and only if R(ζ1 , . . . , ζJ ) is CAMS. McFadden (1978) proves that if A satisfies [G1*], [G2], and [G3], then it is a CPGF for
the ARUM Uj = mj + νj with the CAMS MEV distribution R(ν1 , . . . , νJ ) =
exp(−A(exp(−ν1 ), . . . , exp(−νJ ))). Since the CAMS MEV distribution has finite means, [G4] is implied by the first part of Theorem 1.

Multiple Risk Survival Models

Proof of Theorem 5. Let t = exp (− (m + ε)) be an ASM. Then
−E (ln T0 |m) = −E min (− (mj + εj ))
j

= E max (mj + εj ) .
By Theorem 1, this exists and is a CPGF satisfying [G1]-[G4] with exit probabilities satisfying (28).
Conversely, let G satisfy [G1]-[G4]. Then by Theorem 1 there exists an
ARUM m + ε such that G is an associated CPGF. From this define an ASM
by t = exp (− (m + ε)) . This ASM satisfies (27) and (28).
Proof of Theorem 6. In case ε is CAMS MEV then the survival function is
S (t|m) = exp (−G (exp (m + log t))) = exp (−tG (em )) which is an exponential survival function. The hazard rate is given by − ∂ ln S(t|m)
= G (em ) , which
∂t
does not depend on t.
Conversely, assume that the ASM is exponential with constant hazard given

by A (em ) . Note that S (t|m) = S (1|m + ln t) = exp −A em+ln t , such that
S (t|m) = exp (−A (tem )) = exp (−tA (em )) . Now,

Finally, note that C is max-stable such that Lemma 4 implies that R is CAMS
MEV and has the form R(m) = exp (−G (e−m )) . Hence A (e−m ) = G (e−m ).

Proof of Theorem 7.
Let t = exp(−(m + ε)) be the ASM and let R be
the CDF of ε. Write the survivor function P (T0 ≥ et ) = R(−(t + m)) =
exp (−A (em ) Λ0 (et )) . Then the integrated hazard A (em ) Λ0 (et ) satisfies


A (em ) Λ0 (es ) Λ0 et = A (em ) Λ0 es+t .
This implies that Λ0 (es ) Λ0 (et ) = Λ0 (es+t ), which in turn implies that Λ0 (et ) =
et , such that the hazard is constant.
