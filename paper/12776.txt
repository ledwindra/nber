Mandatory Versus Voluntary Disclosure of Product Risks

ABSTRACT
We analyze a model in which firms are able to acquire information about product risks and may or
may not be required to disclose this information. We initially study the effect of disclosure rules assuming
that firms are not liable for the harm caused by their products. Although mandatory disclosure obviously
is superior to voluntary disclosure given the information about product risks that firms possess -- since
such information has value to consumers -- voluntary disclosure induces firms to acquire more information
about product risks because they can keep silent if the information is unfavorable. The latter effect
could lead to higher social welfare under voluntary disclosure. The same results hold if firms are liable
for harm under the negligence standard of liability. Under strict liability, however, firms are indifferent
about revealing information concerning product risk, and mandatory and voluntary disclosure rules
are equivalent.

Mandatory versus Voluntary Disclosure of Product Risks
A. Mitchell Polinsky and Steven Shavell
1. Introduction
Disclosure of information by firms about the risks of their products is of potential social
value because it may help consumers decide whether to purchase the products and how best to
use them. Firms, however, will not want to reveal unfavorable information about product
risks — as that would reduce demand and the prices they could charge — although they will
have an incentive to reveal favorable information. The motive of firms to suppress bad
information about product risks is countered to an extent by regulations requiring the disclosure
of information (such as those promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal
Trade Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission1) and by the threat of liability
for nondisclosure (an issue, for example, in pharmaceutical, medical device, automobile, and
tobacco litigation2). Yet as some observers have suggested, disclosure requirements and liability
for nondisclosure also have an undesirable effect — they reduce the incentive of firms to acquire
information about product risks in the first place (through research, product testing, and the

For example, the Food and Drug Administration requires written “safety reports” for new drug
investigations concerning “[a]ny adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and
unexpected” or “[a]ny finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects
. . .” See 21 C.F.R. § 312.32 . The Federal Trade Commission “ensures both the accuracy of safety information
provided by product sellers and that material safety information is provided.” See Petty (1995, p. 408). The
Consumer Product Safety Commission “requires hazardous household products . . . to bear labeling that alerts
consumers to the potential hazards that those products present.” See U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission,
Office of Compliance, “Requirements under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act: Labeling and Banning

like3). Indeed, if disclosure obligations significantly chill firms’ investment in information about
risks, the obligations could be rendered largely self-defeating because firms would have little
information that they could disclose.
Against this background, we analyze a model in which firms can acquire information
about product risks and may or may not face disclosure obligations. We present the basic
assumptions and framework of analysis in section 2 below. Firms, which have market power,
decide whether to invest resources to acquire information about the risk that their products will
fail and cause harm to consumers. The demand curve that a firm faces depends on the
information that consumers have about the riskiness of its product. If information is not
disclosed by a firm, consumers will rely on statistical information about product risks and make
appropriate rational inferences from the firm’s nondisclosure. Social welfare is the value of
products to consumers minus the harm that they bear, the cost of production, and the cost of
acquiring information about product risk.
In section 3 we evaluate the regimes of voluntary and mandatory disclosure when firms
are not liable for the harm caused by their products. We begin with this case in order to
understand the pure effect of disclosure obligations.
Under voluntary disclosure, firms reveal any favorable information about product risk
that they have, so that they can obtain a higher price, but they do not disclose unfavorable
information, to avoid having to accept a lower price. Although consumers will make a negative
inference from a firm’s silence and lower their demand for its good, the reduction will be limited

To obtain a sense of how significant product safety research is, note that annual expenditures by
biopharmaceutical companies on research and development, the majority of which concerns product testing, were
$51.3 billion in 2005. See Pharmaceutical Industry Profile 2006, pp. 2-4 (available at <http://www.phrma.
org/files/2006%20Industry%20Profile.pdf>, last accessed October 5, 2006). It also has been estimated that annual
spending by the top twenty drug manufacturers on drug safety monitoring after drug approval was $800 million in
2003. See Ridley et al. (2006, pp. 431-32).

by the fact that the firm’s silence could be due to its not having acquired information rather than
to its having decided not to reveal bad information.4 A firm’s incentive to acquire information
will reflect its ability to keep silent if the information turns out to be unfavorable.
Under mandatory disclosure, firms reveal all information about product risks that they
have. Thus, if a firm is silent, the explanation must be that it did not acquire information about
product risk; silence does not result in a negative inference about risk. A firm’s incentive to
acquire information now will reflect its inability to keep silent if the information turns out to be
unfavorable. Hence, the value to a firm of information about risk will be lower under mandatory
disclosure than under voluntary disclosure, and less information will be obtained.
Either disclosure regime could result in greater social welfare. Although mandatory
disclosure obviously is superior to voluntary disclosure given the information about product risks
that firms have — since such information has value to consumers — voluntary disclosure will
induce firms to acquire more information about product risks because they can keep silent if the
information is unfavorable. The latter effect could lead to higher social welfare under voluntary
disclosure. The logic is as follows. Because firms acquire more information under voluntary
disclosure, the likelihood that favorable information will be revealed will rise, even though no
unfavorable information will be disclosed. If the social benefit from the more frequent
revelation of favorable information outweighs the detriment due to silence about unfavorable
information, voluntary disclosure could be superior (the cost of the additional information also
needs to be taken into account).
In section 4 we reconsider mandatory and voluntary disclosure when firms are liable for
the harm caused by their products, according to the negligence rule or strict liability. Under the

For this reason, firms with information will not necessarily be led to reveal it in order to avoid a negative
inference. For details, see the analysis of voluntary disclosure in section 3 below.

negligence rule, firms are liable for harm only if they failed to take optimal care in the
production of their products. Since they will be induced to take optimal care in order to avoid
liability (at least in the simple model we study), they will turn out not to be found liable. Hence,
the conclusions we reach are essentially the same as those in section 3. Firms only reveal
favorable information under voluntary disclosure, and either voluntary or mandatory disclosure
could be superior.
Under strict liability, firms are held liable for harm regardless of their level of care.
Under this rule, consumers are not concerned about the occurrence of harm because they are
assumed to be fully compensated for it. Hence, firms are indifferent about revealing information
about product risk, and mandatory and voluntary disclosure rules are equivalent. Firms do,
though, use the information they have about risk in a desirable way: the prices they charge will
reflect the risk of harm caused by their products and thus will beneficially influence consumer
purchase decisions.
In section 5 we conclude with a discussion of how our analysis would be affected if
consumers can influence the risk of harm through the precautions they exercise in their use of
products (for instance, by taking a drug only with meals if that would lower the risk of adverse
side-effects).
Previous literature of relevance to this article includes Grossman (1981) and Milgrom
(1981), who first emphasized that parties would voluntarily disclose their information; in their
models parties are assumed to possess information rather than to decide whether to acquire it.5
The articles that are most closely related to ours are Matthews and Postlewaite (1985), Farrell
(1986), and Shavell (1994), because they consider both the acquisition and disclosure of product

These and other articles on the disclosure of information are surveyed in chapter 5 of Bolton and
Dewatripont (2005).

information by firms.6 In Matthews and Postlewaite (1985), product information is free for firms
to acquire, and for that reason firms are led to obtain it; they also always disclose information,
even under voluntary disclosure. Thus, the main feature of a regime of voluntary disclosure that
we emphasize — that firms keep silent about unfavorable information — does not arise in their
model; nor, as noted, is the cost of information an issue.7 In Farrell (1986), product information
is costly to acquire, is not always acquired, and firms do not disclose unfavorable information
under voluntary disclosure. Moreover, in his model firms might acquire less information if
disclosure is required, but there is no welfare comparison of disclosure rules. In Shavell (1994),
product information also is costly to acquire, is not always obtained, and firms keep silent about
unfavorable information under voluntary disclosure. Unlike here, however, mandatory
disclosure is always superior to voluntary disclosure in Shavell’s analysis, essentially because
sellers have the socially correct incentive to acquire information due to the assumption that they
are able to extract all surplus from consumers. None of the foregoing articles examines the
effect of liability for harm on the incentive to acquire and disclose information. Our article also
is informed by economically-oriented legal literature on the disclosure of risks, notably Kronman
(1978), which emphasizes the possibility that disclosure obligations would reduce the incentive
to obtain information about risks.

6

There are other articles that address related issues. See, for example, Daughety and Reinganum (2005),
dealing with the incentive of firms involved in litigation over product-related injuries to settle and keep the riskiness
of their products secret. See also Mathios (2000), who examines empirically how a switch from voluntary to
mandatory disclosure affects consumer choices.
7

An additional difference is that even though voluntary disclosure leads to information acquisition and
complete disclosure, it still might not be socially desirable in their model because information could have negative
value to consumers under their assumptions.

2. Framework of Analysis
Consider a population of firms, each of which is a monopolist in its market and makes a
product that may cause harm to consumers.8 The level of a firm’s product risk is assumed to be
unknown to the firm initially but can be ascertained by it at a cost. In particular, let
c = unit cost of making the good; c $ 0;
h = harm from the good;9 h $ 0;
f(h) = probability density over h; f(h) > 0 in [0, hM];10
k = cost to a firm of acquiring information about product risk; k $ 0; and
t(k) = probability density over k; t(k) > 0.
For simplicity, we assume that the harm h is distributed independently among firms and that
production cost c is the same for all firms. A firm knows its cost of acquiring information k, and
different firms face different k. If a firm does not acquire information, it only knows the
distribution f over h, whereas if it does spend k, it will learn h. If a firm learns h, it is able to
credibly reveal h to consumers.11
Two regimes of disclosure by firms are studied: mandatory disclosure of h; and voluntary
disclosure of h.

8

To assume that firms are perfect competitors rather than monopolists would be in tension with firms
spending to acquire information about product risk: the free rider problem would discourage such spending, as any
spending by one firm would benefit all of them since all would be selling the same product.
9

We use the terms “harm” and “risk” interchangeably even though harm is treated as certain (alternatively,
we could, without affecting our analysis, define h to be the expected harm caused by a particular firm).
The assumption that h is bounded is needed to guarantee the existence of an equilibrium in the regime of
voluntary disclosure. See the Appendix, part D.
10

11

For example, the firm could make test results publicly available and have them attested to by a reputable
independent entity.

-7-

Firms decide whether to acquire information about h, whether to reveal h when disclosure
is voluntary, and what price to charge, so as to maximize expected profits, as will be described
below.
A consumer obtains utility from having at most a single unit of the product, and this
value varies among consumers. Let
v = value of a unit of the product to a consumer; and
s(v) = probability density over v; v $ 0,
where s(v) is assumed to be the same for the products of different firms.12 The density s(v)
generates a demand curve. Let
p = price of the product; and
d(p) = demand given p.
It is apparent that d(p) is given by 1 – S(p), where S is the cumulative distribution of v. We will
refer to d(p) as the gross demand curve, since to the degree that consumers bear losses from the
product, their net demand will be lower than d(p).
The losses that consumers expect to bear from the product depend on their knowledge of
the product risk and on the possibility of firm liability, which could result in compensation for
harm suffered.
Consumer knowledge about product risk h is as follows. Consumers know the
probability density f of h, but cannot directly observe h, whether firms know h, or the cost k to a
firm of learning h. However, consumers learn h if a firm reveals h. If a firm does not reveal h,
consumers make a rational inference about h. This inference depends on whether disclosure is
mandatory or voluntary. If disclosure is mandatory, consumers infer that the firm must not have

It will be obvious that nothing essential hinges on this assumption.

acquired information about h — otherwise h would have been revealed — meaning that f must
describe the probability density over h. If disclosure is voluntary, consumers infer that there are
two possible reasons for nondisclosure: either the firm did not obtain information; or the firm did
obtain information and chose not to disclose it. The particular implications of consumer
inference under voluntary disclosure will be explained below.
Social welfare equals the value consumers obtain from consumption of products minus
the harm they suffer from the products, production cost, and firms’ cost of acquiring information.
We now describe socially best behavior, as a standard of comparison to what occurs
under different disclosure rules and liability regimes. Consider a particular firm whose harm is h
and suppose that h is known. Then it is desirable for a consumer to obtain the product if and
only if v $ c + h.13 Consequently, social welfare from consumption of the product is
hM 4

WI = I I (v – c – h)s(v)dvf(h)dh,

(1)

0 c+h

where the subscript I indicates that information about h is available to consumers.
Now suppose that h is not known, so that all that is known is f and the expected harm
E(h). Hence, it is desirable for consumers to obtain the product if and only if v $ c + E(h), and
social welfare is
4

WN = I(v – c – E(h))s(v)dv,

(2)

c + E(h)

where the subscript N stands for no information about h.
The social value of information about h is readily verified to be the sum of two positive
terms,

13

We suppose for concreteness that consumers obtain the product when they are indifferent, and we will
make similar assumptions below without further comment.

-9-

E(h) c + E(h)

hM c + h

WI – WN = I I(v – c – h)s(v)dvf(h)dh + I I(c + h – v)s(v)dvf(h)dh.
0

c+h

(3)

E(h) c + E(h)

The first term is the value of favorable information, that is, when h is less than E(h), in which
case more consumers obtain the product and enjoy the surplus v – c – h (those with v in [c + h,
c + E(h)]). The second term is the value of unfavorable information, when h exceeds E(h), in
which case fewer consumers obtain the product and thus avoid the loss c + h – v (those with v in
[c + E(h), c + h]).
A firm should obtain information if and only if its cost k is less than or equal
to (3).
In sum, we have
Remark 1. The socially best outcome is as follows:
(a) If information about product risk h is acquired by a firm, consumers should obtain the
product if and only if their value v is at least c + h .
(b) If information about h is not acquired, consumers should obtain the product if and
only if their value v is at least c + E(h).
(c) The social value of information is given by (3) and is due to additional consumption
when the information is favorable (h < E(h)) and to reduced consumption when the information
is unfavorable (h > E(h)).
(d) A firm should acquire information about h if and only if the firm’s cost of acquisition
k is less than or equal to the social value of information (3).

3. Mandatory versus Voluntary Disclosure in the Absence of Liability
We now examine and compare mandatory and voluntary disclosure when firms are not
liable for harm.

- 10 -

Mandatory disclosure. Under this regime, if a firm invests in information and learns the
product risk h, the firm must disclose h to consumers.14
To determine outcomes, suppose first that a firm acquires information about h. Then,
since h must be revealed, consumers will make a purchase if and only if v $ p + h. In other
words, the effective demand curve of consumers is 1 – S(p + h) and is lower than d(p); we will
refer to this demand curve as dh(p). The firm will then set the profit-maximizing price at p(h),
where marginal revenue equals marginal cost c, and will make a corresponding level of profits.
Let

B(h) = firm’s profit when the harm is h and the demand curve is dh(p).
Now suppose that a firm does not acquire information about h. Then consumers view the
harm they suffer as E(h), and so will make a purchase if and only if v $ p + E(h). The demand
curve faced by a firm will thus be dE(h)(p) = 1 – S(p + E(h)), the price will be p(E(h)), and profits
will be B(E(h)).
The value of information to a firm under mandatory disclosure is
E(B(h)) – B(E(h)),

(4)

which is positive (see the Appendix, part A). Firms will acquire information when k is less than
or equal to (4).
To summarize, we have
Proposition 1. Suppose that disclosure of product risk is mandatory and that there is no
liability for product harm. Then:
(a) If a firm acquires information h, the firm will disclose it and charge the price p(h).
14

We assume that the state is able to determine (at least with some probability) whether a firm possesses
information about product risk, in order to enforce disclosure obligations. We do not consider regulation of firms’
choices whether to acquire information about h. Such regulation would not be feasible if the state is unable to
observe a firm’s cost k of acquiring information.

- 11 -

(b) If a firm does not acquire information, consumers will view the expected harm as E(h)
and the firm will charge the price p(E(h)).
(c) Firms acquire information if and only if their cost k is less than or equal to the private
value of information (4).
This outcome diverges from the socially optimal outcome in two respects. First,
consumers purchase too little because of monopoly pricing: the price, p(h) or p(E(h)), exceeds c,
so that too few consumers buy the product, given the available information about harm.
Second, the value to firms of information about product risk (4) is generally different
from the social value of information about product risk (3). We would expect the private value
to be lower, and thus for there to be too little acquisition of information, because firms are not
able to extract the full surplus from consumers. This intuition is borne out, for example, in the
case of linear demand (see the Appendix, part B). It is possible, however, for the private value of
information to exceed the social value, because the fraction of consumer surplus that the
monopolist is able to capture could increase when information becomes available (see the
Appendix, part C).
Voluntary disclosure. Under the voluntary disclosure regime, if a firm acquires
information and learns the product risk h, it can decide whether to reveal h.
To determine outcomes under this regime, assume first that a firm acquires information
and reveals h. Then, as before, the demand curve of consumers will be dh(p), and the firm will
set the price at p(h) and earn profits of B(h).
Suppose alternatively that a firm does not disclose h, either because it decides not to
disclose that it knows h or because it does not know h. A firm’s situation will be the same in

- 12 -

both cases, since consumers are assumed to be unable to distinguish between them.15 Consumers
then view the harm they suffer as E(h|N), the expected harm conditional on nondisclosure, so
will make a purchase if and only if v $ p + E(h|N). The demand curve faced by a firm will thus
be dE(h|N)(p), the price will be p(E(h|N)), and profits will be B(E(h|N)).
Next consider the choice of a firm that acquires information about h whether to disclose
it. If the firm does not disclose h, it will make a profit of B(E(h|N)), whereas if it discloses h, it
will make a profit of B(h). Since B is strictly decreasing in h, the firm will disclose h if and only
if h < E(h|N), that is, if and only if information is favorable.16
We can now compute the value of information to a firm. If the firm acquires information,
we know from the preceding paragraph that its expected profit is
E(h|N)

IB(h)f(h)dh + (1 – F(E(h|N))B(E(h|N)),

(5)

0

where F is the cumulative distribution of h. If a firm does not obtain information about h, it
makes profit of B(E(h|N)). Let
η = value of information to a firm under voluntary disclosure.
Hence,
E(h|N)

η = I[B(h) – B(E(h|N))]f(h)dh,

(6)

0

Firms that did not acquire information about h would wish to indicate this fact to consumers if they
could. This observation raises the question whether a firm could warrant that it does not know h by contracting
with, say, an independent auditor to certify that it did not acquire information. We assume that such warranties are
not feasible because the entities hired to do the certifying are unable to discover whether a firm possesses
information about product risk. This assumption is in some tension with our assumption that the state is able to
determine whether a firm possesses information about product risk in a mandatory disclosure regime. However, the
state has powers for learning facts that are unavailable to private parties (notably the ability to compel testimony
under oath and to issue subpoenas backed by the threat of criminal sanctions).
15

16

Note that “favorable” information is endogenous to the model, since E(h|N) is determined within the

model.

- 13 -

that is, the extra profit that the firm obtains when h turns out to be favorable. This must be
positive since, as noted above, B is strictly decreasing in harm. Firms will acquire information
when k is less than or equal to η.
Finally, we will verify that an equilibrium value of the expectation E(h|N) exists. Let
q = likelihood of a firm not having information conditional on nondisclosure.
The likelihood of nondisclosure is
(1 – T(η)) + T(η)(1 – F(E(h|N)),

(7)

where T is the cumulative distribution of k. Hence,
q = (1 – T(η))/[(1 – T(η)) + T(η)(1 – F(E(h|N))].

(8)

E(h|N) = qE(h) + (1 – q)E(h|h $ E(h|N)),

(9)

E(h|N) must satisfy

since, as we have explained, firms that know h do not disclose it if and only if h $ E(h|N). Note
that (9) implicitly involves E(h|N) through q (including because η is a function of E(h|N)), as
well as explicitly. Equation (9) is the equilibrium condition: if E(h|N) satisfies (9), then if firms
and individuals believe E(h|N), their belief will in fact be correct, and conversely. We show in
the Appendix, part D, that a solution E(h|N) to (9) exists.
Observe from (9) and from the fact that E(h|h $ E(h|N)) > E(h)17 that E(h|N) must exceed
E(h), reflecting the relatively high expected harm of firms that acquire information but choose
not to disclose it.
To summarize, we have
Proposition 2. Suppose that disclosure of product risk is voluntary and that there is no
liability for product harm. Then:
This follows from the general point that E(h|h > z) > E(h) for any z > 0 in the support of h, since the
density f of h is positive on [0, z].
17

- 14 -

(a) If a firm acquires information h and h is favorable — less than E(h|N) — then the firm
will disclose h and charge the price p(h), but if h is unfavorable — equals or exceeds E(h|N) —
then the firm will keep silent and charge the price p(E(h|N)).
(b) If a firm does not acquire information, consumers will view the expected harm as
E(h|N) and the firm will charge p(E(h|N)).
(c) Firms acquire information if and only if their cost k is less than the private value of
information (6).
This outcome diverges from the socially optimal one in two general respects. First,
consumer purchases may be suboptimal for several different reasons. If a firm learns h and
discloses it, too little may be purchased due to monopoly pricing. If a firm learns h and does not
disclose it, then too little may be purchased due to monopoly pricing, or too much because
consumers underestimate harm — they believe the expected harm is E(h|N), whereas the true h is
higher.18 Additionally, if a firm does not learn h, then too little is purchased not only because of
monopoly pricing, but also because consumers overestimate expected harm — they believe it is
E(h|N), whereas expected harm actually is lower, E(h).
Second, the private value of information (6) is generally different from the social value
(3), for essentially the reasons discussed in the case of mandatory disclosure (see the Appendix,
parts E and F).
Comparison of mandatory and voluntary disclosure. We first claim that the private
value of information about product risk is higher under voluntary disclosure (6) than under
mandatory disclosure (4). This follows from two observations. First, if a firm learns h, its
expected profits must be higher under voluntary disclosure: the firm makes greater profits than

18

The problem of excessive purchase occurs if p(E(h|N)) + E(h|N) # v < c + h.

- 15 -

B(h) when h exceeds E(h|N) and it is silent about h, whereas under mandatory disclosure the firm
makes only B(h) for such h; when h does not exceed E(h|N) and the firm reveals h, the firm
makes B(h) under both voluntary and mandatory disclosure. Second, if a firm does not acquire
information about h, its profit will be lower under voluntary disclosure: the firm makes

B(E(h|N)), whereas under mandatory disclosure it makes the higher amount B(E(h)). Thus, the
private value of information is higher under voluntary disclosure not only because a firm’s
expected profit is higher when it acquires information, but also because its profit is lower when it
does not.
Social welfare may be either higher or lower under voluntary disclosure of product risks
(see the Appendix, parts G and H). The explanation is as follows. Mandatory disclosure
involves two social advantages relating to better consumer purchase decisions. First, when firms
acquire information about h, h is revealed to consumers, so their purchasing decisions are
perfectly informed. Under voluntary disclosure, h is not revealed to consumers if h is
unfavorable, in which case their purchasing decisions are not perfectly informed — they may
purchase the good when they should not because they do not know that h is unfavorable.
Second, when firms do not obtain information about h under mandatory disclosure,
consumers believe correctly that the expected harm is E(h), so that their purchasing decisions are
correct given that firms do not know h. Under voluntary disclosure, however, consumers believe
that the expected harm is E(h|N) > E(h), so their purchasing decisions are not correctly
informed — they may refrain from purchasing when they should, because they think
nondisclosure is a worse signal than it is in fact for firms with no information about h.
However, voluntary disclosure has an advantage over mandatory disclosure relating to
firms’ incentives to acquire information. As we explained, the private value of information

- 16 -

about h is higher under voluntary disclosure, so more firms will obtain information than under
mandatory disclosure. Some of the firms that would not have obtained information under
mandatory disclosure will learn that h is favorable and thus disclose this information. When this
happens, consumers will make purchase decisions based on knowledge of h, whereas they would
not have known h under mandatory disclosure (they would only have known E(h)). Thus, some
consumers who should purchase the product will do so, even though they would not have under
mandatory disclosure.
The comparison between the regimes can now be summarized.
Proposition 3. The differences between voluntary and mandatory disclosure regimes are
as follows:
(a) If a firm acquires information h and h is unfavorable — exceeds E(h|N) — then the
firm will keep silent under voluntary disclosure, and consumers will believe the expected harm
to be E(h|N), but the firm will disclose h under mandatory disclosure.
(b) If a firm does not acquire information about h, then consumers will believe the
expected harm to be E(h|N) under voluntary disclosure and E(h) under mandatory disclosure.
(c) The value of information under voluntary disclosure (6) exceeds that under mandatory
disclosure (4).
(d) Social welfare could be higher under either voluntary disclosure or mandatory
disclosure.
One may view the possible superiority of voluntary disclosure over mandatory disclosure
as stemming from the problem that the private value of information is likely to be socially
inadequate under mandatory disclosure (see the comments following Proposition 1). Because

- 17 -

the private value of information is higher under voluntary disclosure, voluntary disclosure can be
regarded as an implicit means of correcting for this problem.

4. Disclosure under Liability Rules
We now reexamine disclosure of product risks when firms may be held liable for losses
caused by their products. We analyze the two major rules of liability — negligence and strict
liability.
Negligence. Under the negligence rule, a firm is held liable for harm only if its level of
care was below a legally determined standard of care. To consider this rule, we need to add to
the model a variable corresponding to costly care in the manufacture of the product.19 Let
x = level and cost of firm care per unit of the good; and
r(x) = probability of harm given x; rN(x) < 0 and rO(x) > 0.
We assume for simplicity that x is chosen by a firm before it obtains information about harm h.
Thus, the socially optimal x minimizes the sum of the expected harm and the cost of care,
r(x)E(h) + x, for each unit of the good. Call this x*. We assume that courts set the standard of
care at x*, so firms are held liable for harm only if their care x was below x*. It is readily shown
that this rule will induce firms to choose x*.20
Because firms are led to choose optimal care x* and therefore are not in fact liable for
harm, the analysis of disclosure under the negligence rule is essentially identical to that in the

19

Note that we are discussing negligence in relation to the manufacture of the good — not negligence in
regard to a duty to disclose information.
For x < x*, a firm’s cost per unit is x + q(x)E(h) because it is liable. For x $ x*, a firm’s cost per unit is
just x because it is not liable. Clearly, x = x* will be preferred to any higher x. And since for x < x*, x + q(x)E(h) >
x* + q(x*)E(h) > x*, x* also will be preferred to any lower x. This is a standard result in the literature on liability
for accidents. See, for example, Shavell (1987, pp. 33-36).
20

absence of liability, except that where we previously referred to harm h or expected harm E(h),
we now refer to r(x*)h or r(x*)E(h). Thus, we have
Proposition 4. Under the negligence rule, firms are led to take optimal care and therefore
are not held liable for harm due to their products. Hence, Propositions 1-3 continue to hold.
Strict liability. Under this rule, a firm is held liable for harm regardless of the level of
care that it exercised. Thus, for each unit of the product, the firm’s expected liability and cost of
care is r(x)E(h) + x, and it will choose optimal care x* to minimize this sum.
Since consumers know that they will be compensated for any harm h that they suffer, the
magnitudes of h and r(x) will not matter to them; their net demand curve will equal their gross
demand curve d(p).21 Consequently, firms will be indifferent about revealing h, and the regimes
of mandatory and voluntary disclosure will thus be equivalent.
Because demand for the product will not depend on consumer knowledge of product risk,
the private value of information to firms is calculated differently from before. If a firm does not
obtain information about h, its per unit cost will be c + r(x*)E(h) + x*, and the firm will choose
the profit-maximizing price given this marginal cost and the demand curve d(p). Its resulting
profit again can be denoted B(E(h)), but with the understanding that the argument E(h) now
refers to a parameter of the firm’s cost function rather than of the consumers’ demand curve. If a
firm does obtain information, it will know that its per unit cost will be c + r(x*)h + x*, so it will
set a different price, resulting in profit B(h). In other words, prices will be different when firms
obtain information about h, not because demand will change, but rather because firms then will
know their actual liability cost instead of just their expected liability cost. The value of
information to a firm therefore will be E(B(h)) – B(E(h)), as in (4), but with the different
21

If consumers can take precautions to reduce expected harm, they may want to know about product risk
under strict liability. See section 5.

- 19 -

interpretation of the profit function stated above. The private value of information to a firm may
be either higher or lower than the social value, for reasons analogous to what we discussed in
section 3, but we would expect the private value to be lower.
We summarize as follows.
Proposition 5. Under strict liability, firms are led to take optimal care. Because
consumers and firms are indifferent about revelation of product risk information, mandatory and
voluntary disclosure are equivalent. Firms have a positive incentive to obtain information, which
could be socially inadequate or socially excessive.
As was observed, consumer decisions are influenced by firms’ information about product
risk because the prices firms charge reflect the information they obtain. Interestingly, this
influence operates both when the information is favorable and when it is unfavorable, in contrast
to the case of voluntary disclosure in the absence of liability, when unfavorable information is
not revealed by firms and does not directly influence consumer purchases.

5. Concluding Remarks
A factor that we did not analyze in the model is that information about product risk may
have value to consumers because it may influence the precautions they employ in their use of
products, such as taking a drug only with meals to reduce the chance of an adverse side-effect, or
driving a particular type of car slowly in snow because of its tendency to skid.
If we incorporated consumer precautions into our model, the analysis of disclosure in the
absence of liability would include the point that consumers’ precautions would be optimal given
their information, as they would bear their losses. Moreover, because information about product
risk would benefit consumers by allowing them to take precautions that reflect risk, firms would

- 20 -

have an added incentive to acquire and disclose information. But firms still would not want to
disclose sufficiently unfavorable information, and the value of information under voluntary
disclosure still would be higher than under mandatory disclosure. Hence, the qualitative results
we found would carry over, and either the mandatory or the voluntary disclosure regime could
be preferable.
Similarly, our analysis of negligence would be essentially unchanged. Again, if the
standard of care under the negligence rule is chosen optimally, firms would meet the standard
and not be found liable, so the situation would turn out to be the same as in the absence of
liability.
Under strict liability, however, there would be two notable differences due to the issue of
consumer precautions. First, as is well known in the economic analysis of liability, a pure strict
liability rule would lead consumers to exercise inadequate care because they would be fully
compensated for their losses. To remedy this problem, a defense of contributory negligence
would need to be employed, under which firms would not be held liable if consumers failed to
meet a standard of care applicable to them. This defense would induce consumers to take proper
precautions given their information. Second, firms would not be indifferent with respect to the
disclosure of information about product risk, as they were in the setting in section 4. They would
now have a motive to disclose even unfavorable information. In essence, this is because the firm
not only pays for the harm to consumers (it is strictly liable), it also implicitly bears the cost of
consumer precautions (since demand falls to the extent consumers undertake precautions).
Hence, the firm should want to minimize the expected harm plus the costs of precautions, and for
consumers to be induced to take the optimal level of precautions, they must know the level of
harm.

Appendix
In this appendix we demonstrate several results claimed in section 3 when firms are not
liable for causing harm.
A. Proof that the private value of information is positive under mandatory disclosure.
Let pN = p(E(h)) be a firm’s price if it does not acquire information and qN = dE(h)(pN ).
Suppose the firm learns h, discloses it, sets the price D(h) so that quantity is always qN , that is,
dh(D(h)) = qN . We claim that E(D(h)) = pN. Now by definition of the demand curves, we know
that qN = 1 – S(pN + E(h)) and dh(D(h)) = 1 – S(D(h) + h). And since qN = dh(D (h)), we must
have pN + E(h) = D(h) + h. Taking the expected value of each side, we obtain, pN + E(h) =
E(D(h)) + E(h), implying the claim. The claim means that the firm would make the same profit if
it discloses h and sets the price at D(h) as when it does not have information: for its expected
revenue would be the same (the claim), and its production cost would be qN c in both cases. But
the firm can obviously make greater profits by disclosing h and choosing p(h) instead of D(h), so
the value of information must be positive.
B. Proof that the private value of information equals one-half of the social value under
mandatory disclosure if demand is linear.
Let the demand curve be linear, with an inverse demand curve given by p = k1 – k2q,
where k1 and k2 are positive constants.
To compute the social value of information, observe that in the absence of information
about h, social welfare equals the area between the demand curve and the full social cost of the
product, c + E(h), which is (k1 – c – E(h))2/2k2. If information about h is acquired, social welfare
given h is (k1 – c – h)2/2k2. Hence, the social value of information is

- 22 -

hM

[I(k1 – c – h)2f(h)dh/2k2] – [(k1 – c – E(h))2/2k2].

(A1)

0

Now consider the private value of information. If information about h is not acquired, it
is easily verified that the firm’s profit is B(E(h)) = (k1 – c – E(h))2/4k2, whereas if h is learned,
the firm’s profit given h is B(h) = (k1 – c – h)2/4k2 . Hence, the private value of information is
hM

[I(k1 – c – h)2f(h)dh/4k2] – [(k1 – c – E(h))2/4k2],

(A2)

0

which is half of (A1).
C. Example in which the private value of information under mandatory disclosure
exceeds the social value.
We provide a discrete example, which could readily be converted into a continuous
example (as can other discrete examples in other parts of the Appendix).22 Suppose that there
are two types of individuals, a low-benefit type whose benefit is 5 and a high-benefit type whose
benefit is 7, with probabilities of .9 and .1, respectively, and that the level of harm is 4 or 6, with
probabilities of .8 and .2, respectively. Assume for simplicity that the cost of production is zero
(it will be obvious that the result to be obtained would hold if production costs are positive but
small).
To compute the social value of information, note that in the absence of information, the
expected harm is .8(4) + .2(6) = 4.4, so both types should obtain the product. Hence, social
welfare is .9(5 – 4.4) + .1(7 – 4.4) = .8. If h is learned and is 4, then both types should obtain the
product, whereas if h is 6, then only the high-benefit type should obtain it. Hence, social welfare

22

The calculations in the examples are undertaken to a greater degree of precision than is reported. As a
consequence, there are some slight inconsistencies in the reported numbers due to rounding error.

- 23 -

is .8[.9(5 – 4) + .1(7 – 4)] + .2[.1(7 – 6)] = .98. Thus, the social value of information is
.98 – .8 = .18.
To determine the private value of information, observe that if h is not known, the lowbenefit type will obtain a net benefit from the product of 5 – 4.4 = .6 and the high-benefit type
will obtain a net benefit of 7 – 4.4 = 2.6. Hence, the firm will charge .6 and make a profit of .6
(rather than charge 2.6 and make a profit of .26). If the firm learns h and it is 4, then the net
benefit of the low-benefit type is 5 – 4 = 1 and that of the high-benefit type is 7 – 4 = 3.
Therefore, the firm will charge 1 and make a profit of 1. If h is 6, the firm will sell only to the
high-benefit type, charge 1, and obtain a profit of .1. Hence, the expected profit if information is
obtained is .8(1) + .2(.1) = .82. The private value of information therefore is .82 – .6 = .22,
which exceeds the social value of .18.
The explanation of why the private value of information exceeds the social value in this
example is, in essence, that when the firm knows h it is able to extract more of the surplus from
the high-benefit types, but this source of private value is not associated with a social value.
D. Proof that an equilibrium exists under voluntary disclosure.
We want to show that there is a value of E(h|N) that satisfies (9). For notational
simplicity here, let E(h|N) be represented by z, so we want to show that there is a z satisfying
[q(z)E(h) + (1 – q(z))E(h|h $ z)] – z = 0,

(A3)

where, recall, q(z) is given by (8).
We first demonstrate that the left-hand side of (A3) is positive at z = E(h): Observe that
E(h|h $ z) > E(h) for any z > 0 in the support of h, since the density f of h is positive on [0, z].
Also, it is clear from (8) that q(z) < 1 since T(η) > 0 and (1 – F(z)) > 0. Hence (1 – q(z)) > 0.
Thus, the term in brackets exceeds E(h), implying that the left-hand side is positive.

- 24 -

Now observe that the limit of the left-hand side of (A3) as z approaches hM is negative:
Let ηM be the limit of η as z 6 hM; it is apparent from (6) that this limit exists. From (8), the limit
of q(z) as z 6 hM is (1 – T(ηM))/(1 – T(ηM)) = 1. Thus, since E(h|h $ z) is bounded by hM, the limit
of the left-hand side of (A3) as z 6 hM is E(h) – hM < 0.
Since the left-hand side of (A3) is a continuous function of z, it must equal zero
somewhere between E(h) and hM.23
E. Example in which the private value of information under voluntary disclosure is
less than the social value.
Since we employ a discrete example similar to that in part C, our discussion here will be
abbreviated. There are two types of individuals, whose benefits are 5 and 7 with probabilities of
.6 and .4, respectively, and levels of harm of 4 or 6 with probabilities of .45 and .55, respectively.
First consider the social value of information. In the absence of information about harm,
the expected harm is 5.1, so only high-benefit types should obtain the product. Hence, social
welfare is .4(7 – 5.1) = .76. If there is information about h and it equals 4, both types should
have the product, whereas if h is 6, then only the high-benefit type should have it. Hence, social
welfare is .45[.6(5 – 4) + .4(7 – 4)] + .55[.4(7 – 6)] = 1.03. The social value of information is
thus 1.03 – .76 = .27.
We next calculate the private value of information. As discussed in the text, the private
value of information under voluntary disclosure depends upon E(h|N), which must be
endogenously determined. To this end, let the cost k of acquiring information be .2 and 1 with
equal probability. We will now compute E(h|N) on the provisional assumption that only the lowcost firms acquire information and that they disclose h only if it is 4. This assumption will be
23

However, (A3) might equal zero at more than one point; thus, the equilibrium might not be unique. None
of our results would be affected if there are multiple equilibria under voluntary disclosure.

- 25 -

shown to be consistent with the behavior of firms. The fraction of firms that do not disclose
information because they do not acquire it is .5 (those whose k is 1), while the fraction of firms
that do not disclose information because they discovered unfavorable information is .5(.55) =
.275 (those whose k is .2 and who learn that the harm is 6). Thus, the likelihood of a firm not
having information conditional on nondisclosure, q, is .5/(.5 + .275) = .645. The expected harm
conditional on information being unfavorable, E(h|h $ E(h|N)), is 6. Thus, applying (9), E(h|N) =
.645(5.1) + .355(6) = 5.42.
Now suppose that a firm does not acquire information. Then the low-benefit individuals
will not purchase the product because E(h|N) is 5.42, exceeding their benefit of 4. The highbenefit types will obtain a net benefit of 7 – 5.42 = 1.58. Hence, the firm will charge 1.58 and
obtain an expected profit of .4(1.58) = .632.
Finally, observe that if a firm acquires information, since E(h|N) = 5.42, it will reveal h
only if it is 4. If h is 4, the net values of the low-benefit and high-benefit types are 1 and 3,
respectively. The firm will charge 3 and obtain a profit of 1.2. Since the firm will not reveal h if
it is 6, the firm will make a profit of .632, as explained in the preceding paragraph. Thus, the
firm’s expected profit if it acquires information is .45(1.2) + .55(.632) = .888, and the private
value of information is .888 – .632 = .255, which is less than the social value of .270. Note, too,
that since the private value of information is .255, firms whose k is .2 will acquire it, but firms
whose k is 1 will not, as assumed.
F. Example in which the private value of information under voluntary disclosure
exceeds the social value.
We showed in section 3 that the private value of information under voluntary disclosure
(6) exceeds that under mandatory disclosure (4). We provided an example in part C above in

- 26 -

which the private value of information under mandatory disclosure exceeds the social value.
Hence, were disclosure voluntary in that example, the private value of information also would
exceed the social value.
G. Example in which mandatory disclosure results in higher social welfare than
voluntary disclosure.
We will employ here the example from part C, assuming that firms’ k is equally likely to
be .2 or 1.
To compute social welfare under mandatory disclosure, recall from part C that the private
value of information is .22. Hence, only low-cost firms will acquire it. For such firms social
welfare is .8[.9(5 – 4) + .1(7 – 4)] + .2[.1(7 – 6)] – .2 = .78, since, as seen above, both types of
consumer purchase the product when h is 4 and only the high-benefit types purchase the product
when h is 6. For firms that do not acquire information, social welfare is .9(5 – 4.4) + .1(7 – 4.4)
= .8. Hence, social welfare under mandatory disclosure is .5(.78) + .5(.8) = .79.
To determine social welfare under voluntary disclosure, assume that only low-cost firms
acquire information and that they disclose it only when h is 4, which will be shown to be
consistent with the behavior of firms in equilibrium. Thus, the probability of nondisclosure due
to the absence of information is .5, while the probability of nondisclosure due to the acquisition
of unfavorable information is .5(.2) = .1. Accordingly, q = .5/(.5 + .1) = .83 and E(h|N) =
.83(4.4) + .17(6) = 4.67.
Now consider the profit of a firm if it does not acquire information. The net benefit to
the low-benefit types will be 5 – 4.67 = .33 and to the high-benefit types 7 – 4.67 = 2.33. The
firm would charge .33 and make a profit of .33.

- 27 -

If the firm acquires information and h is 4, the firm will disclose it. The net benefit to the
low-benefit types will be 5 – 4 = 1 and to the high-benefit types 7 – 4 = 3. The firm will charge
1 and make a profit of 1.
If the firm acquires information and h is 6, the firm will not disclose it. The situation is
then identical to that when the firm does not acquire information and its profit will be .33.
Thus, if the firm acquires information, its expected profit will be .8(1) + .2(.33) = .87.
The private value of information under voluntary disclosure therefore is .87 – .33 = .53.
Consequently, as we assumed, only firms whose k is .2 will acquire information.
For firms that acquire information, social welfare is .8[.9(5 – 4) + .1(7 – 4)] + .2[.9(5 – 6)
+ .1(7 – 6)] – .2 = .6. For firms that do not acquire information, social welfare is .9(5 – 4.4) +
.1(7 – 4.4) = .8 Hence, social welfare under voluntary disclosure is .5(.6) + .5(.8) = .7, which is
less than social welfare under mandatory disclosure. The explanation is that under both
mandatory and voluntary disclosure, only low k firms acquire information; since information is
the same under both regimes, mandatory disclosure is preferable because it leads to better
consumption decisions.
H. Example in which voluntary disclosure results in higher social welfare than
mandatory disclosure.
Modify the example just considered by assuming that the probabilities of h being 4 and 6
are .25 and .75, respectively, so E(h) is 5.5.
To calculate social welfare under mandatory disclosure, note that if no information is
obtained, then the low-benefit types will not purchase the product because E(h) of 5.5 exceeds
their benefit of 5. Hence, a firm will sell only to the high-benefit types, charge 7 – 5.5 = 1.5, and
make a profit of .1(1.5) = .15. If a firm acquires information and h is 4, the firm will charge 1

- 28 -

and make a profit of 1. If h is 6, the firm will sell only to the high-benefit types, charge 1, and
obtain a profit of .1(1) = .1. Hence, the expected profit if the firm acquires information is .25(1)
+ .75(.1) = .325. The private value of information therefore is .325 – .15 = .175, so, since k is
either .2 or 1, neither type of firm will acquire information. Consequently, social welfare is .1(7
– 5.5) = .15.
To ascertain social welfare under voluntary disclosure, assume that only low-cost firms
acquire information and that they disclose it only when h is 4. Thus, the probability of
nondisclosure due to the absence of information is .5, while the probability of nondisclosure due
to the acquisition of unfavorable information is .5(.75) = .375. Hence, q = .5/(.5 + .375) = .57
and E(h|N) = .57(5.5) + .43(6) = 5.71.
Now consider the profit of a firm if it does not acquire information. Given that E(h|N) is
5.71, it can only sell to the high-benefit individuals, will charge 7 – 5.71 = 1.29, and earn profits
of .1(1.29) = .129.
If the firm acquires information and h is 4, the firm will disclose it. The net benefit to the
low-benefit types is 5 – 4 = 1 and to the high-benefit types is 7 – 4 = 3. The firm will charge 1
and make a profit of 1.
If the firm acquires information and h is 6, the firm will not disclose it. The situation is
then identical to that when the firm does not acquire information and its profit will be .129.
Thus, if the firm acquires information, its expected profit will be .25(1) + .75(.129) =
.346. The private value of information under voluntary disclosure therefore is .346 – .129 =
.218. Consequently, firms whose k is .2 will acquire information, but not firms whose k is 1, as
assumed.

- 29 -

For firms that acquire information, social welfare is .25[.9(5 – 4) + .1(7 – 4)] + .75[.1(7 –
6)] – .2 = .175. For firms that do not acquire information, social welfare is .1(7 – 5.5) = .15.
Hence, social welfare under voluntary disclosure is .5(.175) + .5(.15) = .163, which exceeds
social welfare under mandatory disclosure.
This result occurs for the following reason. Under mandatory disclosure, firms do not
have an incentive to acquire information. Under voluntary disclosure, however, the value of
information is higher and low-cost firms do acquire information. When the harm is low these
firms disclose it, improving purchase decisions (because low types then purchase the product).
