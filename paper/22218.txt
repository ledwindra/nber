ABSTRACT
The Occupational Requirements Survey (ORS) is a new survey at the Bureau of Labor Statistics
which collects data on the educational, cognitive, and physical requirements of jobs, as well as
the environmental conditions in which the work is performed. Using pre-production data, we
provide estimates of a subset of elements by broad industry and occupation and examine the
relationship between the cognitive elements and measures of education and training. We exploit
the overlap between ORS and the National Compensation Survey to estimate models of the
returns to different occupational requirements. Finally, we examine the relationship between
occupational requirements and occupational safety measures and outline potential research uses
of the Occupational Requirements Survey.

Introduction
Does the US workforce have the skills needed to be internationally competitive in the

21st century? Which jobs are vulnerable to loss as a result of the introduction of new
technology, competition from trading partners or offshoring (Autor 2015; Blinder 2009; Jensen
and Kletzer 2010; Oldenski 2014)? Why have the differentials between the earnings of those
with a college education and those without widened since 1979 (Bound and Johnson 1992; Katz
and Murphy 1992)? What types of skills have a high and/or rising return in the labor market
and what skills do not, and which skills are complementary with each other (Murnane, Willett
and Levy, 1995; Borghans, ter Weel, and Weinberg, 2014; Weinberger 2014; Deming 2015)?
More generally, how are worker skills, job tasks, technological change, and international trade
interacting to affect the earnings distribution and the employment structure (Acemoglu and
Autor, 2011; Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux 2011)? To address these questions, it is useful and, in
some cases, essential to have a solid understanding of the skills demanded of the workforce, as
well as the tasks that must be performed.1
While there are several data sets that researchers draw upon in studies of these kinds of
questions – including the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), the Occupational Information
Network (O*NET), and the OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) – the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) is currently conducting the Occupational Requirements Survey (ORS), which promises to
provide new information at the detailed occupational level. The ORS, developed in
collaboration with the Social Security Administration (SSA), collects elements in four categories

1

Acemoglu and Autor (2011) distinguish between skills and tasks as follows. They define a task “as a unit of work
activity to produce output.” On the other hand, skill is considered to be a “worker’s endowment of capabilities for
performing various tasks.”

3

-- educational requirements, mental and cognitive demands, physical demands and
environmental working conditions. While, as will be discussed in greater detail below, the
primary reason for the initiation of the ORS is for potential use by SSA as a data source in
disability adjudication, the data will be useful for numerous stakeholders due to the type of
information collected and the level of detailed estimates that will be available as the first years
of collection are completed.
In fiscal year (FY) 2015, BLS completed data collection for the ORS pre-production test.
The pre-production test might better be described as a dress rehearsal as the sample design,
collection procedures, data capture systems, and review were structured to be as close as
possible to those that will be used in full-scale production, when there will be a larger sample
size and the estimates will be intended for evaluation for use in the disability adjudication
process. The pre-production sample, which is the source of the estimates presented in this
paper, is nationally representative when appropriate sample weights are used. 2
This paper is organized as follows: section II provides context for ORS by briefly
describing the disability adjudication process, the data needs of this process, and how ORS is
structured to meet those needs. Section III presents some initial estimates of occupational
requirements, including educational, mental and cognitive, and physical demands. Section IV
exploits the linkage between ORS and BLS’s National Compensation Survey to provide an
exploratory analysis of the relationship between ORS elements and wages. Section V examines
the relationship between job requirements and safety outcomes, while Section VI concludes
and outlines additional potential uses for ORS data.

The pre-production data will not be used in SSA’s disability adjudication process.

The Occupational Requirements Survey
A. Dictionary of Occupational Titles and Disability Determination
A brief history of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) and disability

determination by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which is recounted in Handel
(2015a), will help to place the ORS data collection efforts in context. Beginning in 1939, the
Department of Labor (DOL) published the first edition of the DOT, which was designed as a tool
to facilitate matching job-seekers to vacancies during the Great Depression. The second, third
and fourth editions of the DOT appeared in 1949, 1965, and 1977, respectively, with a partial
update, called a “revised fourth edition”, published in 1991. While the DOT retained its original
purpose, beginning with the third edition, the SSA contracted with DOL to publish a supplement
known as the Selected Characteristics of Occupation (SCO), to be used in disability
determination. The SCO added information on Specific Vocational Preparation (SVP) -- the
amount of time required for a worker to learn the techniques needed for average performance
in a given job – along with elements on physical demands and environmental conditions. The
DOT is still used in disability determination, though given that it was last updated in 1991, SSA
has long wanted to find more current information.
For DOL’s purposes, the DOT has been replaced by the Occupational Information
Network, known as O*NET. As a bridge, early versions of O*NET reviewed raw data collected
for the DOT in previous decades and recoded them in terms of the new O*NET variables.
O*NET began collecting new data from surveys of job incumbents in 2001, replacing the
recoded DOT data on a rolling basis until June 2008, when the first complete version of O*NET
5

based on new data became available. In contrast to the DOT, where jobs were rated by job
analysts, O*NET is largely based on responses by incumbents, although job analysts do
complete certain sections of it (see Handel (2015b) for further details). O*NET, however, has
not been usable from SSA’s standpoint because it does not contain the full set of detailed job
requirements needed to adjudicate disability claims under current Social Security regulations
and policy.
For the purposes of Social Security Administration disability adjudication, the law
defines disability as the inability to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically
determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which
has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. SSA
uses a five step sequential process to determine disability. By the end of the third step 3, the
claimant who has met current earnings and medical hurdles has his/her residual functional
capacity to perform work-related activities classified according to the five exertional levels of
work: sedentary, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy. The final two steps require
occupational information to compare the functional capacities of an individual to those
required by available jobs:
•

Step 4. Previous work test. Can the applicant do the work he or she had done in the
past? If the individual’s residual functional capacity equals the previous work
performed, the claim is denied on the basis that the individual can return to his/her
former work. If the claimant’s residual functional capacity is less than the demands of
his or her previous work, the application moves to Step 5.

3

Step 1. Is the claimant engaging in substantial gainful activity? Step 2. Does the claimant have a severe
impairment? Step 3. Does the impairment(s) meet or equal SSA’s medical listings?

6

•

Step 5. Any work test. Does the applicant’s condition prevent him or her from
performing “any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national
economy?,” meaning work that “exists in significant numbers” either in the region of
residence or in several regions of the country. 4 If yes, the application is accepted and
benefits are awarded. If not, the application is denied. In this step, the residual
functional capacity is applied against a vocational grid that considers the individual's
age, education and the transferability of previously learned and exercised skills to other
jobs. The vocational grid directs an allowance or denial of benefits.
The elements of ORS are designed with the needs of Steps 4 and 5 of disability

adjudication in mind. As noted earlier, there are four different categories of information that
are collected. Educational requirements include whether literacy is needed, degrees required
with respect to formal education, and certifications, licenses and training. These elements, in
turn, are used to calculate specific vocational preparation. Mental and cognitive elements
include task complexity, work control and interaction with regular contacts. 5 A wide range of
physical demands is asked about, including hearing, use of keyboarding, visual acuity, sitting,
standing, stooping, kneeling, crawling, crouching, pushing, pulling, reaching, strength, climbing
and manipulation. Finally, environmental conditions comprise such elements as the
temperature, exposure to fumes, humidity and wetness. Appendix A contains a full list of data
elements.

The wording of the mental and cognitive elements have been changed for production. A sample of the collection
form is available at http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ors/occupational_requirements_survey_elements_private.pdf.

Despite the fact that ORS is designed for disability adjudication, as noted in the first
section, that does not mean it cannot be put to more general research purposes. In section III,
we discuss links between a classification of jobs based on ORS elements and the influential job
categorization scheme of Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003).
B.

ORS Procedures and Sampling

The goal of ORS is to collect and publish occupational information that meets the needs
of SSA at the level of the eight-digit standard occupational classification (SOC) that is used by
the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). 6 The ORS data are collected under the
umbrella of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ National Compensation Survey (NCS) 7 program. The
NCS is an establishment-based survey that provides measures of (1) employer costs for
employee compensation (ECEC), (2) compensation trends (Employment Cost Index, or ECI), (3)
the incidence of employer-provided benefits among workers, and (4) provisions of selected
employer-provided benefit plans. The NCS uses Field Economists (FEs) to collect data, rather
than, for instance, mailing out questionnaires. FEs are well-suited for ORS data collection as
their training focuses on identifying the appropriate respondent, probing the respondent to
clarify apparent inconsistencies in responses, and following up with respondents to ensure data
are complete and accurate. FEs generally collect data elements through either a personal visit
to the establishment or remotely via telephone, email, mail, or a combination of modes.
The ORS pre-production sample was drawn from the same frame as the NCS – the
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which includes all establishments covered by
6

The occupational classification system most typically used by BLS is the six-digit SOC (www.bls.gov/soc/),
generally referred to as “detailed occupations”. O*NET uses a more detailed occupational taxonomy
(www.onetcenter.org/taxonomy.html), classifying occupations at eight-digits and referring to these as “O*NETSOC 2010 occupations”. There are 840 six-digit SOCs and 1,110 eight-digit SOCs.

state unemployment insurance laws, and a supplementary file of railroads. The frame contains
virtually all establishments in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia in the private
sector (excluding agriculture, forestry and fishing and private households) and in state and local
governments.8 The pre-production ORS sample contains 2,549 establishments. Approximately
15 percent of these units are government owned and 85 percent privately owned. Roughly
one-third of the ORS pre-production sample consists of establishments that are also in the NCS
sample. This overlap is notable because, as we discuss in greater detail in Section III, for this
portion of the sample it is possible to obtain wage and other data to match with the ORS
elements.
Of the 2,549 establishments contacted by field economists, 1,851 of them provided
usable data, indicating a usable establishment response rate of 73 percent. Some 6 percent of
the initial sample was either out of business, out of scope, or had no jobs that were within
scope, with the remaining 21 percent constituting refusals.
For each establishment in the ORS sample, jobs were selected for inclusion in the survey
with probability proportional to incumbent employment; these jobs are referred to as
“quotes”. The number of jobs selected within a private establishment varies from 4 to 8, based
on establishment size, and, in government, the number of jobs ranges from 4 to 20. It is
common for multiple individuals within an establishment to have the same job (e.g.,
elementary school teachers within a school/school district), which can result in fewer individual
quotes for that establishment. Because the quote-level information is tied to the job, not the

8

Federal government workers are out of scope for ORS.

9

individual, sampling a certain number of jobs within an establishment is not equivalent to
sampling a certain number of workers within an establishment.
ORS pre-production data collection began in October 2014 and continued until May
2015. At the close of the data review process, information on 7,109 quotes or jobs had been
collected from the 1,851 establishments, slightly fewer than 4 jobs per establishment. These
jobs spanned all 22 unique 2-digit SOCs in scope for ORS and 704 unique 8-digit SOCs. 9 The 704
8-digit SOCs represent 63.4 percent of the 1,110 unique 8-digit SOCs. In order to be able to
present estimates that cover the economy as a whole and do not overload the reader with
numbers, most of the occupational estimates we present in the next section are at the more
aggregate level of nine major occupations. We also present estimates for 11 major industries.

III.

Occupation Requirements: Evidence from the ORS Pre-Production Sample

A. Educational Requirements
We now turn to actual estimates of job requirements from the ORS pre-production
sample, starting with the category educational requirements. It is important to note that these
are “research” estimates only. Due to alternative categorizations of certain data elements and
different approaches to calculating standard errors, estimates presented in this paper may not
match any official estimates from the pre-production data released by BLS.
Spurred in part by the rise in returns to a college education – for instance, between
1979 and 2013, the wage premium earned by college graduates relative to high school
graduates widened from 24.95 percent to 50.18 percent for women and from 20.18 percent to

9

There are 23 2-digit SOCs in the classification system, but military (SOC 55) is out of scope for ORS.

10

48.44 percent for men 10 -- growing attention is being paid in the political arena to boosting
attendance at college, in part by making it more affordable. According to the Obama
Administration, “Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is no longer just a pathway to
opportunity for a talented few; rather, it is a prerequisite for the growing jobs of the new
economy.” 11 With this in mind, the Administration has asserted that everyone should obtain at
least one year of higher education or post-secondary training. In this context, it is interesting to
note that, according to ORS estimates shown in Table 1, an associate’s degree is required in 4
percent of jobs, a bachelor’s degree in 18 percent, and a graduate or professional degree in 5
percent. Thus, according to ORS, only about one-quarter of employment requires any type of
college education. A high school degree is, however, required for 43 percent of jobs. No
degree is required in 31 percent of employment, with 2.6 percent of all jobs said to not require
any literacy whatsoever.
How do these results compare to those from other sources that have tried to measure
the same concept? O*NET also assesses the education requirements of occupations, though,
because it does not publish economy-wide estimates, we calculated them by averaging
estimates at the detailed occupation level using weights obtained from BLS’s Occupational
Employment Statistics program. The categories used by O*NET, in part because they involve
certifications, are somewhat different than those used by ORS, but some comparisons can still
be made.

10

These estimates are from EPI analysis of Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group microdata. The
college wage premium is the percent by which wages of college graduates exceed those of otherwise equivalent
high school graduates, regression adjusted (http://www.epi.org/chart/swa-wages-figure-4n-college-wagepremium-2/).

Whereas ORS indicates no degree is required in 31 percent of the jobs, in O*NET the category
for less than high school contains only 14 percent of employment. 12 ORS data indicate that 43
percent of jobs require a high school degree, which is roughly the same as the proportion in the
O*NET categories high school or high school plus certification. O*NET, however, has 15 percent
of employment in the categories for individuals either with some college or an associate’s
degree, while only 4 percent of jobs is in the associate’s degree category in ORS. The
percentages requiring a bachelor’s degree are similar across the two sources, but O*NET has a
higher proportion in the post-bachelor category (10 percent versus 5 percent), which in O*NET
includes everything ranging from post-bachelor certification to post-doctoral training.
The ORS education requirements estimates can also be compared to a relatively recent
source of nationally representative data that has a number of elements in common with ORS,
Michael Handel’s Survey of Workplace Skills, Technology and Management Practices (STAMP).
STAMP’s estimates are based on self-reports of job incumbents and its first wave (of two) was

12

O*NET estimates used are from version 19.

12

conducted between October 2004 and January 2006, with a sample of 2,304 respondents. The
data are not publicly available but some comparisons can be made with ORS on the basis of
results presented in Handel (2015c). Instead of inquiring directly about literacy, STAMP asked
whether any reading was required on the job. According to STAMP, some reading was required
of 96 percent of the workforce, compared to the estimate in ORS that 97.4 percent of jobs
required literacy. STAMP divided occupations into five groups: upper white collar
(management, professional, technical occupations), lower white collar (clerical, sales), upper
blue collar (craft and repair workers—e.g., construction trades, mechanics), lower blue collar
(factory workers, truck drivers, etc.) and service (e.g., food service workers, home health care
aides, child care, janitors, police and fire fighters). The percentage where reading is required
ranged from 91 percent for the two blue collar groups up to 99 percent for the upper white
collar one.
Handel (2015c) also provides information of the educational requirements of job. The
numbers are fairly close to those from ORS in terms of the shares requiring a bachelor’s degree
or beyond. According to STAMP, a graduate degree was required in 6.3 percent of the jobs,
versus 5 percent in ORS, with a bachelor’s degree needed in an additional 20.8 percent (18
percent in ORS) of the jobs. Some college but less than a bachelor’s degree was required in
16.5 percent of the jobs, much greater than in ORS. A high school degree by itself was required
in 42.6 percent of the jobs and a high school degree plus vocational training in an additional 6.3
percent of the jobs. The remaining 7.6 percent required less than a high school degree.
B. Specific Vocational Preparation

13

Aside from formal education requirements, 13 ORS also asked about prior experience,
post- employment training, and certificates and licenses. The duration associated with all of
these are used to calculate SVP, which, as noted above, is the amount of time needed for an
individual to get to an average level of performance. SVP totals time spent both in formal
education and certification and training programs that prepared the individual for the job (preemployment training), required prior work experience in related jobs, and the time needed in
the job itself to get to average performance (post-employment training). It is important to keep
in mind that SVP could be high both because a long period of specialized on-the-job training is
needed and because much time must be spent in specialized formal schooling. SVP is
measured in days and then grouped into nine categories ranging from “short demonstration” to
over 10 years. Owing to the sparseness of responses for some categories 14, particular for
estimates by industry and occupation, we collapse these nine categories into four: one month
or below; more than one month up to and including one year; more than one year up to and
including four years; and more than four years.

13

For the purposes of SVP, formal education focuses on the “vocational” component of the education. High
school, for example, is not included in formal education, except in the rare case that an individual spent time in a
vocational high school program. Generally, a 4 year college degree will have 2 years of general education
requirements, which means only 2 years counts towards SVP. Post-baccalaureate degrees tend to be entirely
vocational in nature, in which case the entire length of the post-baccalaureate degree is included in the SVP
measure as well as two years of college education.
14
Estimates are not shown on the tables if their relative standard errors (RSEs) exceed 0.3. In addition, when the
sum of a group of estimates is equal to one, a suppression for RSE reasons generally necessitates a secondary
suppression, given that it would be possible to deduce the suppressed estimate’s value from the values of the
other estimates.

Note: Dash indicates no workers in this category or data did not meet publication criteria

As shown at the top of Table 2, across all workers, according to ORS respondents, about onethird of jobs can be learned within one month’s time. At the other end of the spectrum, a bit
more than one-sixth of jobs require over four years to get to average performance. Looked at

15

differently, roughly half of employment requires less than one year of SVP, and the other half
needs more.
We now examine SVP by major occupation (nine categories) and major industry (eleven
categories) to get a better understanding of what is behind the distribution for the economy as
a whole. As occupation is what one does, while industry is where one does it, in general, one
would expect there to be larger differences by occupation than industry in education
requirements, skills demanded and tasks performed. Support for this supposition can be found
in the fact that occupations have more explanatory power than industries with respect to other
measures related to the labor market such as wages (see Pierce 1999, for example). Though a
given occupation may differ across industries, much of the differences we will note across
industries are a result of their differing occupational compositions.
As Table 2 shows, there is substantial variation by major occupation in SVP. Both
management, business and financial occupations and professional and related occupations
have more than 90 percent of employment in categories where the SVP exceeds one year. In
contrast, service; sales and related; and transportation and material moving occupations all
have a majority of employment where SVP is one month or lower.
Examining SVP by major industry, one sees less variation than by occupation, with a few
of the industry SVP distributions being fairly close to that of the economy as a whole. There are
notable exceptions, though. On the low SVP side are those industries where SVP is less than a
year for substantially more than half of employment, which includes retail trade, transport and
warehousing, leisure and hospitality, and other services. On the high SVP side, where SVP is
substantially greater than 1 year for much more than 50 percent of employment, are the
16

following industries: financial activities; professional and business services; education and
health services, and public administration.
As previously mentioned, the value of SVP can be driven by requirements of formal
education, pre-employment training, prior work experience, or post-employment training.

Across all workers, the largest shares of SVP are post-employment training (37%) and prior
work experience (39%). This varies markedly by SVP categories. For those in jobs requiring
little preparation, nearly all of the SVP component is captured in post-employment training. At
the other extreme, jobs with the highest levels of SVP have nearly all vocational preparation
captured by required formal education (29%) and prior work experience (62%).

The bar for short demo/1 month duration shows only post-employment training, due to the percentages in the
remaining categories not meeting publication criteria.

C. Mental and Cognitive Demands
We now turn to the second category of data collected by ORS, mental and cognitive
demands, and begin with the element of task complexity. In response to the question, “how
complex are tasks in this occupation,” respondents were able to choose from five different
categories: very complex, complex, moderate, simple and very simple. Once again, we collapse
categories (complex and very complex; moderate; simple and very simple) to obtain more
reliable estimates. About one-half (51 percent) of jobs were rated in the simplest category,
around one-third (34 percent) as moderate, with the remaining 15 percent in jobs rated in the
most complex category. These shares show large differences across major occupations.
Management, business and financial occupations (56 percent), and professional and related
occupations (36 percent) are the only occupation groups where the share of the most complex
category exceeds that for the economy as a whole, with the next highest occupation having a
share of only 14 percent. Examined from the other end of the complexity spectrum,
transportation and material moving occupations (85 percent) and service occupations (81
percent) have the highest shares of the simplest jobs, with sales and related, office and
administration and production also having more than a majority share in this category.

Are there major differences by industry in terms of the distribution of task complexity?
Such differences are, once again, less notable than those for occupation, though still present.
For instance, leisure and hospitality (83 percent), transport and warehousing (77 percent), and
retail trade (74 percent) have higher than average shares of the simplest jobs, while public
administration (26 percent), professional and business services (23 percent), financial activities
(21 percent), and education services (20 percent) have above average shares of the most
complex jobs.
A second dimension of cognitive demands is how closely controlled an occupation’s
work is. We collapse five categories for work control (very loosely, loosely, moderately, closely,
and very closely) to three (closely and very closely; moderately; and loosely and very loosely)
for reasons of reliability. Nearly three-fifths of employment was rated as being closely or very
closely controlled, with a further 29 percent moderately controlled, and 13 percent loosely or
very loosely controlled. There is similar variability across major occupations, as with task
complexity. Management, business and financial occupations (48 percent), and professional
and related occupations (28 percent) are the only occupation groups where the share of loosely
or very loosely controlled jobs surpasses the economy-wide average. Service and
transportation and material moving occupations have about 85 percent of employment in
closely or very closely controlled jobs, with production occupations not far behind at 79
percent.
Major industries with a much higher than average proportion of closely or very closely
controlled jobs include leisure and hospitality (85 percent), retail trade (79 percent), and

20

transport and warehousing (77 percent). Public administration (20 percent), professional and
business services (19 percent) and financial activities (18 percent) rank highest in terms of the
share in the loosely or very loosely controlled category.
The final cognitive element we will consider involves responses to the question, “What
type of work-related interactions does the occupation have with regular contacts?” As with the
other two cognitive elements, five categories have been collapsed into three (structured and
very structured; semi-structured; unstructured and very unstructured) 16. For the economy as a
whole, structured or very structured contacts predominate, being the case in nearly threequarters of employment (72 percent). Semi-structured contacts account for about one-fifth of
employment (22 percent), with the remaining 6 percent in unstructured or very unstructured
contacts. Those in management, business and financial occupations are much less likely to
have unstructured or very unstructured contacts (24 percent), while the contacts of those in
transportation and material moving (96 percent), production (95 percent), service (91 percent),
office and administration (85 percent), and installation, maintenance and repair (85 percent)
are more likely to be structured or very structured.
By industry, once again, there is less variability than by occupation, though leisure and
hospitality (91 percent), transport and warehousing (87 percent), and retail trade (86 percent)
stand out as sectors where contacts are particularly structured.
Thus far, we have been examining education requirements and cognitive demands
independently, but it is also of interest to see how they are interrelated. For instance, how do
16

Very structured is defined as exchanging straightforward, factual information; structured involves coordinating
and routine problem-solving; semi-structured includes problem-solving, discussing, soft-selling; unstructured
includes influencing, persuading, hard-selling; and very unstructured includes defending, negotiating, and resolving
controversial or long-term issues.

21

cognitive demands vary by education requirement? Figure 2 makes it apparent that both task
complexity and work control are strongly ordered by the amount of education required.

As one would expect, as education requirements increase, the share of simple and very simple
jobs decreases and the proportion of complex and very complex jobs increases. Work control is
related in a similar fashion, as higher educational requirements are associated with jobs that
are controlled more loosely. Figure 3 is similar to Figure 2, except cognitive demands are
arrayed against four (collapsed) levels of specific vocational preparation instead of against
22

degrees required. As with education, as the level of SVP rises, task complexity rises, while jobs
become more loosely controlled.

Indirectly apparent in Figures 2 and 3 is the relationship between task complexity and
work control. Looking at the lowest level of educational attainment depicted (literacy, no high
school degree) or at the lowest level of SVP (short demo / 1 month) shows that these jobs are
characterized by simple/very simple tasks and are closely/very closely controlled. A direct
comparison between complexity and control is presented in Figure 4.

The graph depicts the joint probabilities of the categories of task complexity and work controls.
Roughly 48 percent of jobs in the economy can be classified as simple/very simple and
closely/very closely controlled. As the complexity level rises, the level of control decreases –
the diagonal joint probabilities (from lower left to upper right) have the highest density. The
lower right corner, jobs that are simple/very simple and very closely/closely controlled include
occupations such as cashiers and laborers and freight, stock, and material movers. Moving up
diagonally, jobs that are both moderately complex and moderately controlled include teaching
occupations and very complex/complex and loose/very loosely controlled jobs include
24

specialized nurses and software designers. Simple jobs that are moderately controlled include
jobs with low barriers to entry that are typically performed off-site from one’s direct employer,
such as landscapers and personal care aides. Complex jobs that are moderately controlled
include accountants.
Not surprising, but notable, is the very small percentage of jobs that are both simple and
loosely controlled. This intersection represents a key set of job alternatives for individuals with
certain types of cognitive impairments.
Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003), henceforth ALM, developed a task model to predict
the impact of computerization on different kinds of jobs. They divided occupations into a 2 x 2
grid, with one dimension defined by whether the tasks in the occupations are routine or
nonroutine, and the other defined on the basis of whether the tasks are manual or analytical.
They hypothesize substantial computer substitution for routine tasks, whether manual or
analytical. For nonroutine tasks, they hypothesize strong possibilities for complementarities for
the analytical occupations, but limited possibilities for substitution or complementarities for the
manual occupations.
While ORS doesn’t contain the same variables as ALM, one can compare the jobs in our
3 x 3 grid in figure 4 to those in ALM’s 2 x 2 grid. The closely controlled/simple cell in figure 4
appears to contain jobs similar to those in ALM’s routine/manual category (picking and sorting,
repetitive assembly). Their nonroutine/analytical box (e.g., medical diagnosis and legal writing)
also has much in common with the four categories in figure 4 having moderate or greater
complexity and moderate or less control.
D. Strength Requirements
25

We now turn to physical demands and examine a variable called strength, which is a key
element in SSA’s disability process. The variable captures a number of different dimensions of
physical demands and is used to categorize work as either sedentary, light, medium, heavy or
very heavy. For instance, sedentary work is where the job requirements are as follows:
standing for no more than 3/8 of the day; lifting of up to 10 pounds occasionally; lifting a
negligible weight frequently; lifting no weight constantly; no pushing with arms/hands; no
pushing with legs/feet; and no pulling with feet only. At the other end of the spectrum, a heavy
job requires the incumbent to lift more than 100 pounds occasionally, lift more than 50 pounds
frequently, and lift more than 10 pounds constantly. As before, we show estimates with the
categories collapsed into three (sedentary and light, medium, heavy and very heavy).

As shown in Table 4, some 70 percent of employment is estimated to be in the sedentary and
light, 22 percent in the medium and the remaining 8 percent in the heavy categories. Around
85 to 90 percent of employment in management, business and financial occupations,
professional and related occupations and office and administration occupations are in the
sedentary and light category. Major occupations with smaller proportions of sedentary and
light work include construction and extraction (28 percent), installation, maintenance and
27

repair (32 percent), production (45 percent) and transportation and material moving (52
percent). By industry, financial activities (90 percent) and other services (81 percent) have the
highest proportions of sedentary and light work.
IV.

Occupational Requirements and Wages
In this section, we explore the relationship between various ORS elements and wages,

measuring the returns associated with various skills and illustrating the use of ORS data for
labor market analysis. Because ORS itself does not measure wages, we take the 2,106 quotes of
ORS that overlap with the NCS sample and are able to obtain average hourly wage measures for
1,523 of these from the 4th quarter of 2014. It is rare that one has measures of skill and pay for
the same job, as most of the research on pay and skills, at least in the U.S., relies on merging in
occupational-level measures from the DOT or O*NET onto datasets with measures of pay. 17
Before turning to regressions containing ORS elements, it may be useful to say more
about the dependent variable, average hourly wages, which comes from the Employer Costs for
Employee Compensation (ECEC) portion of the National Compensation Survey. In the ECEC,
earnings are defined to include incentive pay but exclude premium pay for overtime, holiday,
and weekend work; shift differentials; bonuses not directly tied to production; payments by
third parties such as tips; and payment in kind such as room and board. The ECEC data are
converted to a cost per hour worked using work schedule information common to all workers
and averaged over the incumbents within a job. Wage data from the ECEC or related
components of the NCS have been used in a number of different studies, including ones on

17

See Autor and Handel (2013) for an exception and further discussion.

28

public-private compensation differentials (Gittleman and Pierce 2012, Munnell et al. 2011),
inequality (Pierce 2010), and inter-industry wage differentials (Gittleman and Pierce 2011).
These average hourly wage data can be linked to the ORS data by job. While the fact
that these data are averages over incumbents is, in certain circumstances, a disadvantage
relative to having data on each individual worker, the ORS data elements apply to each
incumbent so there is a match between the level of aggregation of the wage data and that of
the ORS elements. The key advantage to this approach is that the data on earnings and
requirements are directly linked. Most studies that examine the returns to job attributes rely
on linking microdata on individuals (typically the Current Population Survey or Census public
use microdata) with jobs (from DOT or O*NET) by aligning occupation codes and merging in
occupational averages (examples include Autor et al. 2003, Abraham and Spletzer 2009, and
Ingram and Neumann 2006). As Abraham and Spletzer acknowledge, inaccurate detailed
occupational coding in the CPS and Census raise data quality concerns when data sets are
matched based on occupation. As the NCS and ORS data are collected based on the same
“quote” or job at the establishment, the linkage between pay and ORS elements should be
accurate. 18
We first present the average hourly wage (and associated 95% confidence interval) for
categories defined by the key variables of interest – SVP, education, task complexity, regular
contacts, and strength. With the possible exception of strength, the mean wage associated

18

The fact that ORS has data by the job rather than averages for the occupation as a whole means that it should be
possible to use ORS elements to explain within-occupation wage variation. Such an undertaking will have to wait,
however, until ORS is a full-scale survey (with a larger sample) and is dependent on funding to collect wages along
with ORS elements.

evident in figures 5 through 7. 19

Turning to the multivariate analysis, all models regress the natural log of the wage on a
set of NCS establishment (size, industry, and private/public sector) and job characteristics (full31

time/part-time and union/non-union). Establishment size is captured by four categories: 0-49
(the reference group), 50-99, 100-499, and 500 or more workers. Controls for industry are
made at the broad NAICS grouping: mining and utilities (reference group), construction,
manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation and warehousing, information,
financial services, professional and business services, education and health services, leisure and
hospitality, other services, and public administration. Ownership is controlled for with a
dummy variable for private sector (state and local government is the reference group).
Four models are estimated. Model 1 includes only additional controls for education and
model 2 expands this to include cognitive elements and strength. Models 3 and 4 are similarly
structured, but include SVP rather than education. Consistent with past research, the
establishment variables indicate the presence of establishment-size effects (Brown and Medoff
1989) and inter-industry differentials (Gittleman and Pierce 2011), and little difference by
whether employment is in the private sector or in state and local government (Gittleman and
Pierce 2012). In terms of job characteristics, there are premia for union status (Gittleman and
Pierce 2007) and full-time status (Lettau 1997). These and all our estimation results are
presented in Appendix B.
We first consider education requirements, where the omitted group is jobs where no
literacy is required. The point estimates are ordered in terms of increasing education, but the
standard errors are large, in part because of item non-response. Nonetheless, there is support
for the hypothesis that those jobs requiring bachelor’s degrees or higher have greater earnings
than other jobs. The R-squared, including establishment and job characteristics, is 0.67, high
compared to what one would get in a comparable regression using household data. With just
32

establishment and job controls, the R-squared is 0.43. The magnitude of the return from an
associate’s degree relative to a high school diploma is similar to that in Card (1999) and
Carneiro et al. (2013), who find returns to additional years of education post-high school on the
order of 6-11 percent per year (depending on model specification). The return on a college
degree from in our model is generally larger in magnitude than the literature, though the
overall ordering of the returns to education follow a sensible pattern when taken as a whole.

Work Control

Figure 8 presents coefficients on education, task complexity, and work control from
model 2. Adding cognitive variables to the model decreases the returns to education
considerably – roughly halving them for most categories. This is similar to analysis of the PIACC,
which finds that the returns to education decrease by approximately one-third when skills

33

variables are included in the model (OECD 2013). The R-squared for the model with a full set of
controls for work requirements is 0.77.
It may be worth highlighting again the distinction between tasks (a unit of work activity
to produce output) and skills (a “worker’s endowment of capabilities for performing various
tasks). As Autor and Handel (2013) note, in the Mincer earnings model, skills, as proxied by
education and experience, have an economy-wide price. But because of the ongoing selfselection of workers into tasks and the bundling of task demands within jobs, these authors
view the Roy model as a more appropriate one for analyzing returns to tasks. One implication
of this model is that a Mincer-type regression will not generally recover the average returns to
the tasks. While the cognitive demands that we use in the regression analysis may not fit neatly
into the skill-task distinction, we nonetheless view this as a useful exploratory exercise.
The first cognitive demand we consider in the regression analysis is task complexity.
Wages are ordered by the levels of this element. Those in very complex jobs earn 0.66 log
points more than those in simple ones and those in the moderately complex jobs earn 0.29 log
points more than those in the very simplest (see Figure 8). The positive relationship between
cognitive tasks and wages corroborates Autor and Handel (2013), though the magnitude of the
relationship cannot be easily compared with theirs. Additionally, if we consider task complexity
as roughly synonymous with analytical content then these results also roughly align with those
of Abraham and Spletzer (2009) and Ingram and Neumann (2006).

34

The results from work control are similar to those from task complexity in that wages
are increasing in how loosely the job is controlled. The final cognitive demand that we
consider, type of regular contacts is not significant in the model, which is consistent with the
finding by Pierce (1999) that coefficients on contacts variables tend to be small and imprecisely
estimated in log wage regressions using NCS wage data. The controls for strength are also
jointly insignificant. There is no consensus in the literature on the empirical relationship
between physical demand and wages. Abraham and Spletzer (2009) and Autor and Handel
(2013) find negative returns to jobs requiring physical skills, while Ingram and Neumann (2006)
estimate positive returns to jobs requiring physical effort (though they also include education
controls in their models).
The results for specific vocational preparation (SVP) are similar to those for education
requirements. All the coefficients are significantly positive relative to the omitted group of
short demonstration. The R-squared for model 3, which controls for SVP, establishment and
job characteristics is similar to that for education requirements at 0.66. Much like the model 2
results, including controls for the cognitive and strength requirements roughly halves the
coefficients on SVP (model 4 in Appendix B). Owing to relatively large standard errors, the
adjacent categories are not significantly different at the 10 percent level.

As seen in Figure 9, there are substantial returns to task complexity and work control
requirements, after controlling for SVP. The pattern of returns to these cognitive skills is similar
to those in the education model (Figure 8). Also similar to that model, the returns to regular
contacts and strength are not statistically significant.

Occupational Requirements and Safety Outcomes
How do the physical demands and environmental conditions measured by ORS affect

injury and illness rates? In this section, we present a second type of illustrative multivariate
analysis, examining the relationship between the risk of an occupation, as measured by various
ORS elements, and the outcomes of that risk, as captured by the injury and illness rate. Ideally,
we would take the approach we did with the wage data, and match a job’s ORS elements to its
own injury and illness rate from the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII). 20 If we
were to do this, however, the resulting sample would be both very small and unrepresentative,
given that there is likely to be little overlap between the ORS sample and the SOII sample.
Instead, the approach we use here is to aggregate both the risk and the injury and illness data
by 3-digit SOC, as this seems to be the lowest level of aggregation we can use where there is
enough sample per occupation to adequately measure risk in the ORS data.
Similar research in this area has used the O*NET to calculate occupational risk and used
panel data on a worker’s occupational history to calculate the impact of accumulated risk on
chronic diseases later in life (Dembe et al. 2014). In contrast, our work here focuses on the
impact of occupational risks on occupational injuries and illnesses. Without the occupational
histories used in earlier work, we are unable to calculate the cumulative effect of exposure to
risk over long time periods, and therefore focus primarily on traumatic injuries. One advantage
of the ORS data is that in addition to knowing the mean level of risk for the occupation, we also
have information on the distribution of risk within the occupation. This additional information

20

For more information on the SOII, see http://www.bls.gov/iif/.

37

allows us to focus on elements of risk that are more closely associated with specific
occupations.
While the ORS sample contains 92 unique 3-digit SOCs, to get reliable measures, we
require 20 observations for each of these, which reduces the number to 60. An additional 11 3digit SOCs were dropped because of item-level non-response (if there were fewer than 20
responses per item) and for one 3-digit SOC no injury and illness rate was available from the
SOII. Thus, 48 3-digit SOCs remained for analysis. 21
Risk of injury and illness in the ORS is captured by many variables, with most of these in
the categories environmental conditions and physical demands. We have both dichotomous
measures of the presence of risk, as well as measures of the percentage of time at job with risk.
While the latter is potentially a better measure, it is often not available for a large fraction of
the sample. Thus, we are more likely to use the dichotomous variables, which can make use of
cases where the respondent answered that the risk was present, but the duration was
unknown.
Having 48 3-digit SOCs for analysis leaves us with a relatively small number of degrees of
freedom compared to the number of ORS elements that can potentially explain injury rates.
Because we are running regressions at the 3-digit SOC level, we are, moreover, interested in
restricting ourselves to those ORS elements where occupation has considerable explanatory
power. To address both considerations, we regress each ORS element individually on 3-digit
SOC dummy variables. We choose as regressors those 10 elements where occupation has the
most explanatory power, in all cases with an R-squared exceeding 0.35.

21

We estimate that the dropped 3-digit SOCs account for less than 15 percent of total employment.

Eight of the 10 elements are environmental conditions or physical demands that may
affect risk directly. They are traditional keyboarding, encountering wetness, sitting (percentage
of hours), working near moving mechanical parts, working in high exposed places, driving
required, amount ever lifting/carrying and gross manipulation (percentage of hours). 22 The
other two elements are cognitive demands considered above – task control and work
complexity – which may capture other dimensions of occupations that affect risk.
On Table 6, we examine injury and illness rates at the occupation level from the SOII,
overall, and then by the event causing the injury, nature of the injury and source of the injury.
The rates are measured as cases per 10,000 full-time equivalent workers. Looking at the overall
incidence rate, we see that those occupations where there are higher levels of lifting and
carrying have a higher injury and illness rate, which is also true of those occupations with more
sitting and more gross manipulation. While sitting may not seem to be a risky activity, we will
see when we turn to events, nature and sources why it is associated with higher incidence
rates.

First to be examined is event causing an injury. It is no surprise that those occupations
with a high rate of injuries caused by transportation incidents are strongly positively associated
with driving and lifting/carrying, as these are activities associated with the jobs of
transportation workers. Standard keyboarding, working in high exposed places and near
mechanical moving parts have a negative relationship with transportation injury rates,
presumably because these elements are less common among transportation workers.
Falls to lower levels are, quite sensibly, positively associated with working in high
exposed places. They also have a positive relationship with gross manipulation, while being
negatively related to working with mechanical moving parts. The final event we consider, struck
by object or equipment, is, appropriately, positively associated with working with mechanical
moving parts, as well as with gross manipulation.
Some interesting relationships are also evident in our examination of the nature of the
injuries. Both strains, sprains and tears and soreness and pain are positively related to gross
manipulation and lifting/carrying. Carpal tunnel syndrome, in contrast, is more likely to be
found in jobs where there are mechanical moving parts and where there is a relatively high
amount of sitting.
Finally, we consider the source of the injury. Parts and materials injuries are more likely
to come in jobs with gross manipulation and mechanical moving parts, but less likely when
there is exposure to wetness. Injuries where the ladder is the source are more common in jobs
where workers are in high exposed places. They also have positive relationships with gross
manipulation and standard keyboarding, and negative relationships with large amounts of
sitting, working near mechanical moving parts and the amount of ever lifting and carrying.
41

Injuries where vehicles are the source are somewhat similar to transportation incidents in that
both are more apt to be present in jobs where there is driving, lifting/carrying, much sitting and
where there isn't work in high exposed places or with mechanical moving parts.
VI.

Conclusion: The Potential of ORS for Research
Employing information from the pre-production version of ORS, we have presented a

set of estimates of some key occupational requirements for all workers as well as by broad
occupation and industry categories. We have also illustrated how ORS data can be used in
analysis, focusing on wage determination and the role of job requirements in injury and illness
rates.
As BLS moves into production collection, ORS data will be collected annually on a
substantially larger sample (roughly 6,000 establishments planned in year 1). ORS is currently
approved for an initial three years of collection with the goal of having reliable estimates for
the vast majority of the data elements at the eight-digit O*NET SOC level at the end of the
period. While the data elements and collection procedures are intended to support SSA in
disability adjudication, these data elements will likely also be useful for a variety of other
stakeholders, including researchers.
In addition to the research questions discussed in the introduction, we propose some
other areas of research in which ORS data may prove useful. First, our initial analysis linking
ORS estimates of job requirements, particularly the physical requirements, to safety outcomes
suggests that ORS may be a valuable data set for occupational safety and health researchers.
As ORS will ultimately have full sets of estimates on the types of physical and environmental
conditions required at a detail occupational level, it can be used in research focused on a
42

particular occupation (truck driving, for example) or focused on a specific injury that may occur
across occupations, linked to underlying physical requirements (such as the relationship
between reaching and musculoskeletal injuries).
In addition to considering the direct links between more obviously “risky” job
requirements and injuries, ORS data may inform studies of the role of job requirements and
illness. Occupational illnesses are typically less well understood than injuries since they tend to
result from longer-term exposure to risk factors. Recent research focuses on the relationship
between sedentary behavior (including prolonged periods of sitting while at work) and a variety
of long-term adverse health outcomes including obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular
disease (Dunstan et al. 2012, van der Ploeg et al. 2012, Proper et al. 2011). ORS data can be
used to identify the sets of occupations where workers sit most, and the duration/percent of
time of sitting, as well as the ability of workers to alternate between sitting and standing at
will.
Finally, the current financial strain on the SSI and SSDI programs has led to a great deal
of research regarding the barriers involved in getting persons with disabilities to return to the
workforce. Extensive research exists that documents the negative relationship between SSDI
receipt and labor force participation (Autor and Duggan 2006, Maestas et al. 2013, von Wachter
et al. 2011). ORS does not ask respondents about accommodations for workers with
disabilities; however, disability researchers and advocates may be able to use the ORS data on
physical requirements to identify jobs in which specific accommodations may result in more
employment opportunities individuals with disabilities. For example, understanding the

43

characteristics of establishments where some production workers are able to sit or stand at will
may lead to recommendations for translating this flexibility into other sectors.
Similarly, identifying jobs that are moderately or loosely controlled but require relatively
low levels of SVP provides opportunities to identify the training programs necessary to place
individuals with cognitive impairments and relatively low levels of education in such jobs.
Recent research has found that participation in state workforce programs increases the
likelihood of return to work among SSDI beneficiaries. Information on the amount of training
needed to perform certain jobs may help workforce boards target their programs to such
workers.
