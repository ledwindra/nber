Improvements in Macroeconomic Stability:
The Role of Wages and Prices

ABSTRACT

This paper compares macroeconomic performance in the United States
from 1891 through 19114 with the period after the Second World War by

estimating reduced form autoregressions for prices, wages and output, by
looking at their moving average representations, and by giving them

simple structural interpretations. The results show that the impulses
to the economic system were smaller in the later period, but the

propagation mechanisms are mach slower and more drawn out. The smaller
shocks are therefore translated into larger and more prolonged
fluctuations in output and inflation than would occur if the earlier

dynamics were applicable in the later period. A tentative explanation
for the changes in the dynamics is a slower speed of wage and price

adjustment combined with a different accommodative stance for the
monetary system.

Macroeconomic fluctuations have been less severe in the
last thirty years than in the period before the Second World War.
Although the recessions in the 1970s and i9BOs have been large
and have been associated with big swings in inflation, the
average amplitude of cyclical fluctuations is still smaller
than in the pre—war period.

This improvement in macroeconomic performance was already

evident to most economists by the end of the i9SOs. It served as
the focal point of Arthur Burns' 1959 presidential address before

the American Economic Association. Burns contrasted the milder
post—war fluctuations with those he studied with Wesley flair

Mitchell at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He
attributed the improvement to countercyclical fiscal and monetary

policy as well as to structural changes in the economy: more
stable corporate dividends, steadier employment practices, better
inventory controls, and greater financial stability due to
deposit insurance.

The improvement in economic performance still deserves the

attention of macroeconomists. An understanding of the reasons
for

the

improvement is

invaluable

for recommending what changes

in policy should, or should not, be adopted.

Moreover, at a time

when macroeconomic research is undergoing difficult and

fundamental changes, the improvement serves as a useful reminder
of the practical importance of continued progress in macro—theory

and macro—econometrics. Regardless of one's approach to

1

macroeconomic research, one can, as James Tobin' has urged, "take
some encouragement from the economic performance of the advanced
democratic capitalist nations since the Second World War."

The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of wage

and price rigidities in this improvement in macroeconomic
performance. Wage and price rigidities are at the center of most
modern economic theories of the business cycle. According to
these theories, if wages and prices were more flexible, the
economy would experience shorter and less severe business cycle
fluctuations.

Many economists have therefore suggested economic

reforms——such as synchronized wage and price setting——to make
wages and prices more flexible.

The paper examines changes in wage and price rigidities and
in macroeconomic performance by concentrating on two episodes in

United States history: the quarter century before the First World
War from 1891 through 1914, and the slightly longer period after

the Second World War from 1952 through 1983. Each period
includes S economic fluctuations. By ending the earlier period
before the First World War, we exclude the economic turbulence of
both of world wars as well as the Great Depression of the 1930s.2
Even with these exclusions economic fluctuations in the earlier

period were larger in magnitude than in the post—war period. The
data also indicate that wages and prices were more flexible

in the earlier period. This latter finding, which has also been
noted by other researchers,3 presents a puzzle. Less flexibility
of wages and prices should lead to a deterioration in economic

performance. The comparison suggests that the opposite has
occured. Either other factors——such as those mentioned by

Burns——were strong enough to offset the reduc..ed 2—pr1ce

Si ml e Scorecard for__Macroeconomic Performance

It is useful to becji n with some simple but obj ecU vs
stati sti cal measures of macroeconc)mi c performance in the
different periods. The measures as well as all the statistical

analysis in this paper are based on annual data. Output is
measured by real SNP, prices by the SNP deflator, and wages by
average hourly earnings in manufacturing.

The means and standard deviations of the three detrended

series are presented in Table 1. To be specific, let V be real
SNP and let V* be potential ShIP. Then detrended output given by

yCV—Y*)/V*, and is referred to as

the outpat

gap

in

the figures

and tables of the paper. Potential SNP is assumed to be growing
at

a constant, but

different, exponential rate in each of the

periods. The level of potential is chosen so that the average of
y is zero in each of the periods. Experimentation with some
alternative assumptions about the growth of V* did not affect the

results by much. For example, when the trend in V* was permitted
to change in 1973 to reflect the slowdown in productivity growth
in the U.S., the results where similar.

I chose to detrend

output using a deterministic trend rather than first differences
to capture the tendency for output to return to its potentail
growth path after a disturbance.

On the other hand, wages and prices were detrended by
taking first differences of the logarithms; that is, by looking

at

the

this

tendency was not present in the post—war data before 1982—

Although the U.S. was on a gold standard during the period

bef ore the First World War, the level of prices and wages show no

tendency to regress to a fixed trend or level in that period

either, presumably because of changes in the world gold stock and
in the relative price of gold.

The statistics reported in Table I refer to the detrended
series for output y, wage inflation w, and price inflation p.

According to the standard deviation measure, output fluctuations
have been about 25 percent smaller in the period after the Second
World War than in the quarter century before the First World War.
The improved output performance does not extend to inflation,

however. The standard deviation of the year over year inflation
rate is about the same in the two periods——up slightly for wage
inflation (w) and down slightly for price inflation Cp). The

average inflation rate is much higher in the post—war period by
both measures of inflation.

To provide some perspective I have also included in column
three of Table 1 the same performance measures for the period

from 1910 through 1940, which includes both the First World War

and the Great Depression. This period is far worse than the
other two by any of the performance measures.

Output

fluctuations are almost three times larger than in the post World
War II period, and inflation fluctuations are about four times

larger. Only the average inflation rate is less in this period
than in the post—war period, but since the average is taken over
very large positive values and very large negative values this is
not a very meaningful performance measure.

S

2. Outout and

Inflation

Fluctuations

The statistics in Table I are far from sufficient for
characterizing the dynamic behavior of two such serially and
contemporaneously correlated variables as output and inflation.
Time series charts for inflation and output in the two periods

are shown in the upper and lower panels of Figures 1 and 2. For
additional perspective, the corresponding charts for the 1910—
1940 time period are shown in the middle panels of Figures 1 and

2. Note that the scales on the charts for the different time

periods are different. (The output gap y(V—Y*)/Y* is
superimposed on both the wage inflation charts and the price

inflation charts). Some of the milder recessions in the earlier

period are smoothed out by the use of annual data. The severe
recession that began early in 1893 and ended in mid 1894 stands
out as one of the worst of the period as does thi brief but sharp

recession that began with the financial panic in 1907. The
period ends with the 1914 recession before the beginning of the
First World War.

The charts clearly indicate that the tendency for
inflation to fall in recessions and rise in booms is not a new
phenomenon.

Inflation fell during all of the more severe

downturns between 1891 and 1914. Inflation was negative on
average from 1891 to 1907, and positive on average from 1907

until 1914. During this latter sub—period the world gold supply
steadily increased.

A comparison of the charts for the earlier period
with the charts for the later period reveals in a rough way
many of the differences between the two periods that we will

focus on in this paper. /irst, th ampl itude of the fluctuations

observed.

(Again note the difference in the scales on these

figures). Secoid,

the duration of the fluctuations; in

is longer- in the post—war period; inflation has been much more

persistent" Stated another way, wages and pric:es have
developed more rigidities, in the sense that past values of wages
and prices influence their current values. Much of the higher

inflation persistence is du to the prolonged per':iod in the 1970s
when

the inflation rate was abnormally high before

with much more rapidity. Even the persistent negative trend in
prices and wages before 1897 is swamped by the fluctuations in

the inflation rate;

the positive trend after 1897 is
hidden by the larger fluctuations around the trend.. The third
important difference between the two periods isin the duration

longer since the Second World Ware

The fourth important difference between the two periods is

more difficult to see in the charts, but is somewhat more evident
in Figures 3 and 4. It relates to the ti mirig of the fluctuations

of inflation and output. In the post—war per:iod, there is a
marked tendency for increases in inflation to bring about a
downturn in the economy, although with a lag..

increase in inflation in 1973-74 preceeded the downturn in the

Finally, an

recessions in 1.980—82. And as usual, inflatic3n then fell. It is
very riiffi cult to detect similar patterns in the 1891—1914
period. increases in inflation do not seem to lead the economic
downturns. And the dcci :1 nes in inflation seem to occur
simultaneously with the dec:i i nes in the real economy. Al though

this timinq difference can be pried out of the charts, it emerges
much more easily in the statistical time series analysis of the
next. two sections.

The middle panels in Figures 1 and 2 clearly indicate that
the amplitude of the fluctuations is much larger in 1910—1940
period than in either the period before or the period after. The
effect of the First World War is evident in the boom and the
subsequent recession of 1920, But the extended boom in the 1920s
and the Great Depression dominate the charts. The wide

fluctuations in wages and prices ind:icate the same type of

flexibility that is evident in the period before the First World
War. The persistence of wage and price inflation——a sign of wage
and price rigidities used in macro—theory——definitely seems to be
relatively new phenomenon.

3. Vector Autoreressions
The dynamic properties of output, wages and prices can be
examined more systematically by estimating unconstrained vector
autoregressi ons.
Estimates of bi van ate autoregressions for
S

wage inflation and output, and for price inflation and output are

reported in Tables 2 and 3 for both the 1891—1914 period and
for the 1952—1983 period. The lag length is equal to two years
for all the regressions. For annual data this choice of lag
length seemed to eliminate most of the serial correlation of the

to the equations. Higher order systems with both wage
inflation and price inflation together with output were also

residuals

estimated, but are not reported here. At this level of
aggregation the movements of wages and prices are very similar,

so that the addition of a third variable does not add much to the
analysis.
These autoregressions are not necessarily structural
equations. They are reduced form equations that in principle can
be derived from a variety of systems of structural equations.
The lag coefficients in the autoregressions are in principle
functions of parameters in all the structural equations.
The shocks to each of the autoregressive equations are in

principle functions of the shocks to all the structural equations
and depend on simultaneity parameters in the structural

equations. In this section the aim is simply to describe the
autoregressions rather than give them a structural
interpretation.

A quick glance at Tables 2 and 3 reveals that the
structure of the autoregressions differs by a large amount in the

two periods. Both the structure of the shocks to the equations
(the impulses) and the lag coefficients (the propagation
mechanism) are much different.

9

The lipids.:
The variance of the shocks, or the impulses, to the output
equation, has decreased sharply from the pre—war to the

post—war period. To the extent that macroeconomic policy works
by changing the dynamics of the economy——as it would with
feedback policy, the finding that a reduction in the size of the
shocks explains most of the reduced variability suggests that
such feedback policy was not responsible for improvements in

performance. However, part of the change in policy could affect
the variance of the shocks by working "within the period" to

offset exogenous disturbances. This would be more likely for the
automatic stabilizers which react simultaneously, but with annual

data even a feedback policy which reacts to economic disturbances
within the year would affect the variance of the shocks rather
than the dynamics of the system.

The variance of the shocks to the inflation equations is
also much smaller in the post—war period.

Since the overall

variance of inflation is about the same in the two periods,

changes in the propagation mechanism must have had a positive

influence on the variance of inflation. The impulses have become
weaker.

It is perhaps surprising that the variance of the

shocks to inflation have become smaller. According to these
estimates, an increased importance of price shocks in post—war

business cycles is not supported by a comparison with the period

The use of moving average representations in macroeconomics
originates with the influential paper by Sims(l9Bo) in which he
refers to it as innovation
accountingp the approach has since

been adopted by many other researchers. There are many moving
average representations of a given multivariate

process depending

on what one assumes about the contemporaneous correlation between
the shocks. Sims suggests that a form be chosen so that the
covariance matrix of th• shocks be diagonal——an orthogonalizaio
of the shocks.
This requires a transformation of the

matrices. The transformation is a function of the correlation of
the shocks and depends on how one wishes to order the way the

shocks enter the system. The methodology used here is different
than that of Sims in that the St matrices have not been
transformed to yield orthogonal shocks.

I have found that such a

transformation makes it difficult to give a direct structural
economic interpretation of the S

matrices. The methodology used

here was also used for very similar purposes in an international
comparison of economic performance in Taylor (1960).

5. Structural Interpretations
The vector autoregression can be viewed as a reduced

form

of a structural

model.

Unfortunately the mapping from the

reduced form to the structural form is not one to one. The
traditional identification literature shows formally that there
will in principle be many structural models that are consistent

with a given reduced form. In practice, however, the situation
is not as dismal as

it sounds in principle. There are a

relatively small number of theoretically sound or "reasonable

structural models. Moreover, the properties of an estimated
reduced form can frequently narrow the range of possible
structural models.

The post-war period.
The third property of the estimated autoregressions listed
at the end of the last section is very useful for nailing down a

reasonable structural model. The dynamic interaction between
inflation and output in the post—war period is very strong.
Inflation "Sranger—causes" output

in

a negative direction; and

output "Granger—causes" inflation in a positive direction. This
pattern naturally leads to the following interpretation for the
post—war period.

The Federal Reserve, or the "aggregate demand authorities"

in general, are concerned with stabilizing inflation as

unemployment.

well as

For aggregate demand shocks this joint aim causes

no conflict; the best policy for both price and output

stabilization is to offset the shocks. When an inflation shock

16

comes, however, there is a conflict. The Fed must decide how
"accommodative" to be. On average during the post—war period the
Fed seems to have made a compromise. Policy is described by a

policy rule. When an inflation shock occurs, the Fed neither
fully "accommodates" the shock by increasing the rate of
growth of the money supply point for point with inflation, nor
tries to eliminate the shock immediately by sharply reducing

money growth. Instead, it lets money growth increase, but by

less than the inflation shock. The result is the dynamic pattern
observed in the vector autoregressions. When inflation increases
the Fed lets real money balances——appropriately
and the economy slips into a recession.

defined——fall,

Hence, inflation

"Granger—causes" output. The slack demand conditions then

gradually work to reduce inflation. Hence, output "Granger—
causes" inflation.
This structural interpretation is by no means new, and it
is gradually being incorporated in standard textbooks. For the
data used here the following simple algebraic structural model
seems to match the reduced form very well:

restrictions that occur when the second equation is used to

already in reduced form and is clearly not much different from
the estimated equation in Table 2. The reduced form for

inflation can easily be derived by substituting in the
expectation of equation (6) into equation (5). It also matches
up well with the reduced form equation in Table 2.

these implications plausible?

Flexible Nei;es ad Prices?

The reduced importance of the lagged
20

inflation

term could be

due to simple expectations effects as well as to changes in the

structure of wage and price setting. The inertia effect in the
post—war is a combination of expectations effects and structure.

Since inflationary expectations were probably much lower in the
pre—war period, the effect of lagged inflation would be smaller.

Unfortunatly it is difficult to distinguish these two effects
with aggregate data.

The problem has been addressed by Cagan (1979) and
Mitchell (1953) using microeconomic data. Although neither
author looks at data before the First World War, their findings

are probably relevent for the comparison of this paper. Cagan
compares price movements in the business cycles of the 1920s with
price movements in the business cycles after the Second World

War. Mitchell compares wage adjustments in the 1930s with wage
adjustments in the post—war period. Both find that price and
wage adjustments were larger and more frequent in the earlier

period. From a microeconomic perspective wages and prices were
more flexible.
Two possible reasons for this change have been noted.

First, the increased importance of large business enterprises and
large unions could have centralized price and wage decisions and

made them less subject to.short—run market pressures. In the
major labor unions, for example, the costs of negotiating a large
settlement made it economical to have long three year contracts

in many industries. The overlapping nature of these contracts
added to the persistence of wage trends. Second, economic policy
changed so as to reduce the severity of recessions and thereby

21

lessen the need to reduce wages and prices quickly in the face of

slack demand conditions. This policy effect is different from
the expectation of inflation effect mentioned above.

Non Accosodative

Policy?

Although the U.S. Treasury took on some central bank

functions in the early 1900s, during most of the 1891—1914 period
monetary policy was determined soley by the U.S. commitment to

the gold standard. A gold standard is normally thought to
generate aggregate demand "discipline". Policy would
automatically be non—accommodative. For example, if there was an
inflation shock then a contractionary policy would be necessary
in order to bring the price level back to itt relative position

with gold. Then why does the data suggest the opposite, that
policy was accommodative?
One explanation comes from the fact that the U.S. was a

small open economy during this period. Most price shocks
probably came from abroad, much as the price shocks in the 1970s

came from abroad. An increase in external prices with a

fixed

exchange rate will make domestically produced goods cheaper.
This will lead to a balance of payments surplus until

internal prices rise. A balance of payments surplus increases

the money supply for a country on a gold standard. The increase
in the money supply will therefore tend to occur just as the
domestic price level rises in response to the rise in world

prices. Policy will look very accommodative.
A fixed exchange rate gold standard will be less

accommodative to price shocks that originate at home. A price

harms Eut internal price and wage behavior is likely to be
adversely affected by an accomodative policy.

Another way to describe the pre—war policy rule is that it
was accommodative in the short—run, permitting much slippage to
accommodate external price shocks, but non--accommodative in the

long—run. Prices in the tJni ted States could not di ffer from
world prices in the long—run This is in contrast to the

characterization in the previous section of policy in the postwar period: in the short—run policy is much less ac:commociative
than in the long—run.

6. Concluding Remarks.

Macroeconomic performance in the United States from 1891
through 1914 was much different from the performance after the

Second World War. This difference is apparent in reduced form
autoregressions, in their moving average representations, in

simple structural models, and even in simple time series charts

of the data. The shocks, or i.pa1ses, to the economic system
were smaller in the second period, mainly because of the policy

and structural changes that rthur Burns mentioned in his 1959
presidential address, Deposit insurance, for example, reduced
the shocks to aggregate demand that came from financial panics.

But the dynamics, or popagaiori echriss, of the
economic system are much slower and more drawn out in the post'-

war period. This tends to translate the smaller shocks into

larger

and more prolonged movements in output and inflation than

would occur if the

prewar

dynamics were applicable in the later
24

period. In other words the change in the dynamics of the system
offset some of the gains from the smaller impulses. These postwar dynamics can be given a structural interpretation in terms of
the accommodative stance of monetary policy, and the speed of

wage and price adjustments. These dynamics were not
evident in the pre—war period.

One interpretation of these developments is that the change
in the dynamics was a direct result of the reduction in the

importance of the shocks. For example, prices and wages may have
became more rigid because of the reduced risks of serious

recessions, or because movements in the money supply began to do
some of the macroeconomic stabilization wârk that was previously
done by wage and price adjustments. The analysis of this

paper

is not conclusive on this or the other interpretation that the
change in the dynamics was unrelated to the change in policy.
But the possibility that a combination of the smaller post—war
shocks with the shorter pre—war dynamics might improve

performance, should be sufficient motivation for
further study of thes! historical developments and their
alternative interpretations.
