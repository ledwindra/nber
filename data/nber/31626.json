    "abstract": "\n\nPercutaneous coronary intervention facility openings may have differential effects on treatment and health outcomes for Black versus White patients in residentially segregated versus integrated communities. This study looked at changes in patient treatment and health outcomes (same-day PCI, PCI during hospitalization, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality) after the opening of a PCI facility within a 15-minute drive of a community. Findings show that Black patients in integrated communities experienced the greatest benefits after a PCI opening for every outcome examined. Healthcare stakeholders may be able to use this data to prioritize PCI openings in communities that will derive the greatest benefits\n\n",
