    "abstract": "\n\nAdvocates for sales restrictions on flavored e-cigarettes argue that flavors appeal to young people and lead them down a path to nicotine addiction. This study is among the first to examine the effect of state and local restrictions on the sale of flavored electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products on youth and young adult tobacco use. Using data from the State and National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, we find that the adoption of an ENDS flavor restriction reduces frequent and everyday youth ENDS use by 1.2 to 2.5 percentage points. Auxiliary analyses of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System show similar effects on ENDS use for young adults ages 18-20. However, we also detect evidence of an unintended effect of ENDS flavor restrictions that is especially clear among 18-20-year-olds: inducing substitution to combustible cigarette smoking. Finally, there is no evidence that ENDS flavor restrictions affect ENDS use among adults aged 21 and older or non-tobacco-related health behaviors such as binge drinking and illicit drug use.\n\n",

Global Action\u2019s mission is to end combustible tobacco use, which remains the leading preventable cause of death globally. The organization collaborates with academic and research centers and others to accelerate life-saving research and educational projects. Global Action does not seek or accept funding from companies that produce tobacco or non-medicinal nicotine products. The charitable gift agreement (the \u201cPledge Agreement\u201d) between the organization and its prior funder, PMI Global Services Inc., was terminated in September 2023. To complement the termination of the Pledge Agreement, the organization\u2019s Board of Directors established a new policy to not accept or seek any tobacco or non-medicinal nicotine industry funding.
