the Elderly?

ABSTRACT
Despite the presence of Medicare, out-of-pocket medical spending is a large expenditure risk facing
the elderly. While women live longer than men, elderly women incur higher out-of-pocket medical
spending than men at each age. In this paper, we examine whether differences in marital status and
living arrangements can explain this difference. We find that out-of-pocket medical spending is approximately
29 percent higher when an individual becomes widowed, a large portion of which is spending on nursing
homes. Our results suggest a substantial role of living arrangements in out-of-pocket medical spending;
however, our estimates combined with differences in rates of widowhood across gender suggest that
marital status can explain only one third of the gender difference in total out-of-pocket medical spending,
leaving a large portion unexplained. On the other hand, gender differences in widowhood more than
explain the observed gender difference in out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes.

1. Introduction
It is well known that women tend to outlive men. The average 65-year-old woman has a
remaining life expectancy of 20.0 years, compared to 17.3 years for the average 65-year-old man
(Kochanek et al. 2011). However, despite longer remaining life expectancies, out-of-pocket
medical spending is higher for women than for men. Figure 1 depicts total out-of-pocket
medical spending averaged over five-year age groups for males and females. The figure shows
both that average spending is higher for women in each age group and that the difference appears
to increase at higher ages.
There are a number of possible explanations for this empirical finding. For example,
differences in preferences or insurance coverage can cause out-of-pocket medical spending to
vary across individuals. An alternative explanation – which we investigate in this paper – comes
from the fact that women tend to live longer and marry older men. Therefore, older women are
more likely to be widowed. Widowhood may result in higher out-of-pocket expenses for a
couple of reasons. First, widowhood may be accompanied by changes in insurance coverage or
health status. A widow’s own health may decline – or she may lose private insurance coverage –
upon the death of her spouse. Second, widows are more likely to live alone, and living alone can
result in higher out-of-pocket medical expenses because a spouse or partner may substitute for
paid caregivers. Because rates of private long-term care insurance are low and Medicaid longterm care eligibility requires one to spend down their resources to qualify, out-of-pocket medical
spending is particularly vulnerable to the risk of nursing home or home care expenses. Indeed,
as shown in Figure 2, there is a large gender difference in spending on nursing homes,
particularly at higher ages.

In this paper, we examine the impact of marital status, and in particular, widowhood, on
different components of out-of-pocket medical spending and health care utilization. As there
may be selection into marriage, we use within-person changes in marital status to identify its
causal effects. Because our analysis covers a relatively short time period of 6 years, this method
allows us to measure the near-term effects of widowhood rather than the long-term effects of
widowhood. We find that monthly out-of-pocket medical spending is $43.06, or about 29
percent, higher for widows relative to those who are married. This increase is primarily driven
by nursing home utilization. Out-of-pocket nursing home expenditures increase by $24.82 per
month, accounting for 58 percent of the increase, and the average number of nursing home nights
over a 2-year period increases by 6.3. We find that these results are not driven by observable
changes in health (as measured by self-reported health status, the number of health conditions,
and limitations in activities of daily living) or sources of insurance, which suggests that living
arrangements may be the underlying cause of the increase in out-of-pocket expenses. We also
find that the effect of marital status on out-of-pocket medical spending does not differ by gender.
While the effect of widowhood on monthly out-of-pocket medical spending is nontrivial
and statistically significant, it does not explain a substantial portion of the gender differences in
overall out-of-pocket medical spending. Our simulations suggest that differences in marital
status and living arrangements by gender explain approximately one third of the difference in
male and female medical spending for individuals age 55 and older, leaving a considerable
amount due to other factors. However, accounting for differences in marital status reverses the
gender differences in out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes, implying that widowhood is an
important factor in nursing home demand.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and describes
the contribution of this research. Section 3 describes our data, Section 4 presents our
methodology, and Section 5 summarizes our results. Section 6 details our simulations to
determine the amount of out-of-pocket medical spending explained by marital status, and Section
7 offers conclusions.
2. Literature Review
There is a large literature on risk factors for nursing home entry. Recent systematic
reviews (Luppa et al. 2010; Gaugler et al. 2007; Miller and Weissert 2000) suggest that being
single is consistently associated with greater probability of nursing home entry. Other predictors
that emerge across a number of studies include female gender and living alone, although the
studies reviewed by Luppa et al. (2010) find inconsistent results for these factors. These studies
generally exploit cross-section variation in risk factors to study their effects. Consistent with
these findings, Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) argue that an increase in the elderly population
can reduce long-term care use because healthy elderly people serve as caregivers to those in poor
health. In particular, if growth in the elderly population is accompanied by an increase in the
ratio of males to females, the number of elderly widows – and thus use of long-term care – falls.
Their empirical analysis, based on aggregate county-level data, suggests that a decrease in the
share of elderly men contributed substantially to the observed increase in nursing home care
during the 1970s.
A related strand of research concerns the impact of care by family members (informal care)
on the use of care by professionals (formal care). In studying this impact, it is important to
account for the fact that the level of formal and informal care are jointly determined, and that
unobservable aspects of health status could be correlated with the receipt of both formal and

4

informal care. Bonsang (2009), Van Houtven and Norton (2004, 2008), Bolin et al. (2007), Lo
Sasso and Johnson (2002), Charles and Sevak (2005), and Greene (1983) use an instrumental
variables approach to examine the impact of informal care on the utilization of formal care. In
general, these studies find that informal care by children reduces use of formal care, especially
home care and nursing home stays. Instruments for informal care in these studies include
children’s characteristics (e.g., the genders of the children, as daughters are more likely to
provide care), ethnicity, and proximity of family. Pezzin et al. (1996) find that public
expenditures on home care reduce informal care provided by family, and Pezzin and Shone
(1999) find that paid home health care is a substitute for care by children. In an extension of
their earlier work, Van Houtven and Norton (2008) further show that care by children
significantly reduces Medicare long-term care expenses for single parents; however, this effect is
reduced for married parents.
Some earlier studies have examined the relationship between out-of-pocket medical
spending and the saving behavior among elderly (e.g., DiNardi, French, and Jones 2010; French
and Jones 2004; Palumbo 1999; Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes 1994; Kotlikoff 1988). While
marital status is not the main focus of these studies, French and Jones (2004) do find that, after
controlling for insurance coverage, males have lower costs, while married individuals have
higher costs.
Our work extends this literature in several ways. First, there is a large literature on the
impact of widowhood on income and wealth, and some of this literature focuses on the role of
the out-of-pocket spending of the deceased spouse (see, e.g., McGarry and Schoeni 2005).
However, we are not aware of other work examining the impact of widowhood on the widow’s

5

own out-of-pocket medical expenses.1 Second, our work complements the literature on nursing
home utilization by showing the extent to which increased nursing home utilization among single
individuals translates into higher monetary costs. Moreover, to identify the causal effects of
marital status, we focus on the impact of marital status transitions on out-of-pocket spending.
Thus, we use within-person, rather than cross-sectional, variation in marital status to identify the
impact of widowhood on out-of-pocket spending. It is important to note, however, that an
analysis based on marital status transitions over a relatively short time period can only measure
the near-term impact of shocks to marital status. One might expect the impact of widowhood to
be different for long-term widows compared to the recently widowed.

3. Data
Our data come from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a biennial panel survey that is
designed to be representative of the population aged 50 and older. The HRS began with a group
of non-institutionalized respondents in 1992, but continued to follow them even if they
subsequently became institutionalized. Additional respondents were added in later waves to
keep the sample representative of the target population. The HRS includes demographic
information, as well as detailed data on health status, insurance coverage, and health care
spending and utilization. We restrict attention to the four waves from 2002-2008, as the
components of medical spending are reported in a consistent way across these waves. We also
restrict attention to individuals aged 55 and older.
The HRS includes person-level weights, which can be used to make the survey data match
the characteristics of the non-institutionalized elderly population. Thus, anyone who is in a
1

McGarry and Schoeni (2005) do report the expenditures of the surviving spouse just before and
after widowhood, but focus mostly on the expenses of the spouse who died.
6

nursing home at the time of interview receives a weight of zero. Excluding individuals who are
in a nursing home at the time of interview effectively excludes long-term nursing home
residents, who are likely to represent a large share of out-of-pocket medical expenses. Because
nursing home expenditures are central to our analysis, we report our results without using the
HRS weights. However, we also examine the sensitivity of our analysis to excluding nursing
home residents.
Most of the variables used in our analysis – including medical care utilization, insurance
coverage, health status, and demographics – come from the RAND version of the HRS data.
However, because the RAND dataset includes only total out-of-pocket spending, we must merge
in data on the components of medical spending from the raw HRS data. Because of imputations
and other adjustments that were made by RAND researchers, the components of medical
spending from the raw data do not necessarily sum to the total from the RAND data. Thus, we
create our own measure of total out-of-pocket spending by summing the individual components
from the raw data. The components of medical spending include spending on hospitals, nursing
homes, outpatient surgery, doctors, dental, prescription drugs, home health care, and other
services. The medical utilization measures include the number of doctor visits, hospital stays,
hospital nights, and nursing home nights, as well as indictors for whether the respondent had
doctor visit, hospital stay, home care, prescription drugs, outpatient surgery, dental visit, or other
medical care use.2
In each wave, individuals are asked to report their out-of-pocket medical spending and
utilization since the last interview. New respondents are asked about their spending and

2

The “other” category for both spending and utilization generally includes special facilities, such
as an adult care center, outpatient rehabilitation, transportation or meal services, or a social
worker.
7

utilization over the previous two years. For all components of medical spending except
prescription drugs, respondents are asked about their total spending during the reference period;
for prescription drugs, respondents are asked to provide the average monthly amount during the
period. All of the utilization questions refer to total utilization during the reference period. If an
individual was in the previous wave, the average reference period is 24 months, although it
varies from 13 to 36 months. We exclude individuals who were not interviewed in the previous
wave, and are not new interviewees, as the reference period for these individuals could be much
longer than two years, and some utilization measures cannot easily be adjusted for different
lengths. We convert all out-of-pocket spending amounts (except for prescription drugs) to
average monthly values by dividing by the appropriate reference period. We also use the
Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) for medical care to convert all out-of-pocket spending variables
to 2010 dollars, where the base year for the conversion is the year in which the interview took
place.
One shortcoming of our out-of-pocket spending measures is that they do not include
insurance premiums. The raw HRS data do contain information about premiums for private
health insurance, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and long-term care insurance; however,
the insurance may cover individuals other than the respondent. Though the HRS reports if other
family members are covered, we do not know what fraction of the premium paid is for the other
family member. Thus, we cannot compute an individual-level amount for insurance premiums.
Therefore, our analysis focuses on non-insurance out-of-pocket medical spending.
Our key independent variable is marital status. The HRS marital status variable has seven
categories: (1) married, (2) married - spouse absent, (3) partnered, (4) separated, (5) divorced, (6)
widowed, and (7) never married. We define an individual as married if he or she falls into

8

categories (1)-(3). In certain specifications, we include dummy variables indicating whether an
individual is covered by Medicare, Medicaid, VA/CHAMPUS, a private insurance plan (which
includes a plan offered by the respondent’s employer, the spouse’s employer, and any other plan
besides government or employer-provided), or a long-term care insurance plan.
We also examine the role of own-health changes, by including measures of the
respondent’s self-reported health status, health conditions, and difficulties with activities of daily
living. In each wave, respondents are asked to report a self-assessment of their health on a scale
of 1-5, with 1 being excellent and 5 being poor. The RAND HRS includes an index indicating
the number of health conditions with which the individual has ever been diagnosed, including
high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, lung disease, heart disease, stroke, psychiatric problems,
and arthritis. The RAND HRS also includes indices of the number of activities of daily living
(ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) with which the respondent reports
“some difficulty.” The activities included in the ADL index are bathing, dressing, walking
across a room, getting in or out of bed, and eating. The activities included in the IADL index are
using a telephone, taking medication, shopping, preparing meals, and handling money.
Table 1 provides summary statistics for all variables used in our analysis, measured at the
person-year level and reported separately by marital status. Women are more likely to be single
than men, and the vast majority of single respondents are widowed. Single respondents also
report higher out-of-pocket medical spending, particularly for nursing homes. Figure 3
summarizes total out-of-pocket spending by marital status, gender and age, and Figure 4 does the
same for spending on nursing homes. Figures 3 and 4 suggest that marital status may be able to
explain some, but not all, of the gender difference in out-of-pocket spending. Within both

9

genders, single people have higher out-of-pocket spending than married people. However,
within the same marital status, women still tend to have higher out-of-pocket expenses than men.

4. Methods
Figures 3 and 4 suggest that marital status may play a part in explaining gender differences
in out-of-pocket spending. However, these figures are based on cross-sectional variation in
marital status. The single group includes those who are recently widowed as well as those who
have been widowed for many years, and therefore the figures include both the near-term and
long-term effects of marital status. Moreover, the single category includes never married and
divorced individuals, a group that is potentially selected based on unobservable characteristics.
We conduct our empirical analysis by examining within-person changes in marital status using
individual fixed effects. This approach isolates the near-term, causal effects of marital status.
We begin by estimating regressions of the following form:

y it   1 w

it

  2 d it   3 s it   a it   i   t   it ,

(1)

where yit is any of our measures of out-of-pocket spending or utilization, wit is a dummy
indicating whether individual i is widowed in year t , dit is a dummy indicating whether
individual i is divorced in year t , sit is a dummy indicating whether individual i is single
(never married) in year t , ait is a vector of age dummies for individual i in year t ,  i is an
individual fixed effect,  t is a year (wave) effect, and  it is a stochastic error term. The α’s
measure the impact of being widowed, divorced, or single relative to the reference category of
married. We estimate (1) for each of our spending and utilization measures.
When an individual transitions from being married to single or vice versa, his or her health
insurance coverage may change. While insurance directly lowers out-of-pocket spending, the
10

overall impact on out-of-pocket medical spending could be positive or negative because of
increased utilization due to moral hazard. In addition, an individual’s own health condition may
also change upon becoming widowed, divorced, or married. Therefore, we add to (1) controls
describing each individual’s health and insurance status as described in the previous section. We
allow for full nonlinearity by including each set of variables as indicator variables. If controlling
for health and insurance status substantially reduces the magnitude of the estimated α’s, it would
suggest that changes in out-of-pocket medical spending that occur with changes in marital status
are driven by changes in insurance or health status. Finally, we test whether women are more
vulnerable than men to the effect of marital status by estimating (1) with the marital status
dummies interacted with gender.
We also conduct a series of sensitivity analyses and robustness checks. Because our
definition of married includes a small number of respondents who report their spouses being
absent (largely because either they or their spouses are in nursing homes), we include a separate
dummy for whether the individual’s spouse is in a nursing home. We also estimate (1) only for
individuals with no children in order to determine whether having no children makes individuals
more vulnerable to the effects of widowhood. In addition, we estimate (1) for individuals who
fall within the 5th – 95th percentile of out-of-pocket spending for their 5-year age group. This
illustrates the extent to which our findings are driven by outliers. Finally, we estimate (1) only
for households where neither spouse is in a nursing home at the time of interview. As discussed
earlier, this restriction effectively excludes long-term nursing home residents and illustrates the
extent to which spending by this group drives our results. In all of our regressions, standard
errors are clustered by household in order to account for the fact that individuals from the same
household may have correlated shocks to out-of-pocket spending or utilization.

11

5. Results
Table 2 summarizes the results from estimating (1) on total out-of-pocket medical
spending and its components. The results indicate that being widowed is associated with $43.06
in additional monthly out-of-pocket medical spending relative to being married. This amount
represents a 29 percent increase in the average monthly out-of-pocket medical spending for
married respondents and is statistically significant at conventional levels, though the coefficient
has a large standard error. The main driver of this increased spending is spending on nursing
home care: individuals spend on average $24.82 monthly in additional out-of-pocket nursing
home care when widowed relative to $2.98 spent on average while married. Because the
regressions include individual fixed effects, these estimates are identified off of changes in
marital status within individuals over time. Age and year fixed effects capture differences in outof-pocket spending common to all individuals of a particular age and time trends common to all
respondents.
With the exception of out-of-pocket dental spending, the remaining categories of out-ofpocket spending show no statistically significant relationship of widowhood. In addition, we
find no evidence that being separated/divorced or never married is associated with higher out-ofpocket medical spending overall, though both of these groups experience higher levels of nursing
home spending relative to married individuals.
Given that our analysis focuses on out-of-pocket medical spending and not overall health
spending, if individuals have generous insurance coverage, health care utilization may change
with marital status without changing out-of-pocket medical spending. Table 3 summarizes the
results of estimating (1) using various measures of health care utilization as the dependent

12

variable. Columns (1) through (8) show the effect of marital status on extensive measures of
health care utilization which measure whether the respondent utilized different types of care over
the appropriate reference period. Widowhood is associated with higher rates of outpatient
surgery, nursing home stays, home health care, and use of special health facilities. The
coefficients are large in magnitude: the probability of reporting a nursing home stay increases by
over 70 percent. Separation or divorce is associated with higher rates of outpatient surgery and
nursing home stays, while never married respondents do not exhibit health care utilization
different from those who are married. Table 3 also shows the results of estimating (1) using
intensive measures of health care utilization in columns (9) through (12). Perhaps
unsurprisingly, all respondents spend significantly more nights in nursing homes when
unmarried relative to when they are married. However, the results show no evidence that the
number of hospital stays, doctor visits and hospital nights change with changes in marital status.
We next examine whether the effects of marital status on out-of-pocket medical spending
alter when we control for health status and health insurance, which may also change when
marital status changes. These results are reported in Table 4. The estimated coefficients on
widowhood are smaller in magnitude but change only slightly after the additional controls are
incorporated, suggesting that very little of the effects of widowhood on out-of-pocket medical
spending are due to worsened health status or poorer insurance. A spouse often substitutes for
paid caregivers; in the absence of this form of insurance, individuals often find themselves
needing nursing home care. This effect is likely due to the fact that insurance against long-term
care risk is often inadequate: only 12 percent of our sample owns private long-term care
insurance and Medicare does not cover extended use of long-term care, leaving many to spend
down their resources until eligible for long-term care services through Medicaid.

13

Finally, we analyze whether females are more vulnerable to widowhood than their male
counterparts by estimating interacted versions of (1) which allow us to determine whether the
effects we estimate differ across gender. Table 5 reports our findings. For all components of
out-of-pocket medical spending, the coefficient on the marital status X gender interaction terms
are statistically insignificant, suggesting there is no evidence of a gender difference in the effect
of marital status on out-of-pocket medical spending. The main effects of marital status are less
precisely estimated, though the magnitudes are very similar to those we report in Table 2.
Table 6 reports the results of four different sensitivity and robustness checks. We report
the results for total out-of-pocket medical spending and that spent on nursing homes, but omit the
other components of out-of-pocket spending for simplicity. Columns (1) and (2) report the
results of including an additional control variable indicating whether one’s spouse is in a nursing
home. Having a spouse in a nursing home is highly correlated with being in a nursing home
oneself; thus, it is not surprising to find a large, positive coefficient on this variable in the
nursing home expenditures regression. Columns (3) and (4) report the results of estimating
equation (1) for individuals with no children. None of the marital status coefficients are
statistically significant, providing no evidence that individuals without children are more
vulnerable to the effects of widowhood. We note, however, that the number of individuals with
no children is small. Columns (5) and (6) report the results of estimating equation (1) for
individuals who fall into the 5th through 95th percentile of out-of-pocket spending for their age
group. Now widowhood no longer has a statistically significant impact on total out-of-pocket
spending, and it has a much smaller (statistically significant) impact on nursing home spending.
These results suggest that most of the effects of widowhood are concentrated among a small
group in the form of catastrophic medical spending. Finally, columns (7) and (8) report the

14

results from estimating equation (1) on individuals who are not in a nursing home at the time of
interview. Now widowhood no longer has a statistically significant impact on out-of-pocket
spending, suggesting that long-term nursing home stays play a large role in our results.

6. Simulation Exercise
While our results suggest that marital status has a nontrivial effect on out-of-pocket
medical spending, our analysis thus far does not indicate whether the effect we estimate can
explain the gender differences in out-of-pocket medical spending depicted in Figure 1.
Therefore, we use our results to conduct a simulation to determine what portion of the gender
difference in out-of-pocket medical spending is accounted for by differences in marital status
across gender.
We define:
Na,g

z a,g 

 ˆ
i 1

i

N a,g ,

where N a , g is the number of person-year observations of gender g and age group a , and ˆi is
the estimated individual fixed effect from (1). In other words, z a , g is the mean of the estimated
individual fixed effects from specification (1) for age group a and gender g, calculated across all
person-year observations in age group a and gender g. The difference z a ,women  z a ,men is the
gender difference in unexplained out-of-pocket spending after accounting for marital status
differences in out-of-pocket spending and differences in marital status across gender.
We then estimate an alternative specification
y it   'i   ' ait   't  'it ,

15

(2)

which is the same as (1) but does not include the marital status dummies. We define z 'a, g
analogously for specification (2) for each age group a and gender g. The difference
z 'a ,women  z 'a ,men is the gender difference in unexplained out-of-pocket spending without

controlling for marital status. Finally, we compute the following measure for each age group a:

a  1

z a , women  z a , men
z ' a , women  z ' a ,men

(3)

The value  a represents the share of the gender difference in out-of-pocket spending of age
group a that is explained by marital status.
Table 7 reports z a ,women  z a ,men for both specifications (1) and (2), as well as  a for each of
the 5-year age groups included in Figure 1 and for the sample overall. Panel (a) reports the
results for total out-of-pocket medical spending, and (b) restricts to out-of-pocket spending on
nursing homes. These results suggest that across age groups, marital status can explain about 35
percent of the raw gender difference in total out-of-pocket spending. Marital status tends to
explain a larger percentage of the gender difference for older age groups. While the effect of
marital status is nontrivial, it still leaves a large fraction of the gender difference in out-of-pocket
spending unexplained.
Panel (b) suggests that accounting for differences in marital status across gender reverses
the relationship of out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes between men and women. When
controls for marital status are not included, average out-of-pocket nursing home spending is
higher for women. However, with the addition of marital status controls, men have higher levels
of unexplained out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes. Therefore, accounting for marital
status differences explains more than the entire gender difference in out-of-pocket spending on
nursing homes.
16

7. Conclusions
Despite the presence of near-universal insurance by Medicare, out-of-pocket medical
spending constitutes a large expenditure risk facing the elderly. One of the largest components
of this risk is spending on nursing home care because private insurance coverage for long-term
care expenses is low and eligibility for Medicaid coverage of long-term care requires an almost
complete spend-down of financial resources.
In this paper, we show that living with one’s spouse appears to at least partially proxy for
paid caregivers, as nursing home costs increase substantially with widowhood, even after
controlling for changes in health and insurance status. The increased nursing home costs
generate an increase in total out-of-pocket medical spending of approximately 29 percent for
widowed elderly relative to married elderly. By including individual fixed effects, our analysis
uses marital status changes, rather than long-standing differences in marital status, to identify the
near-term, causal effects of marital status.
While the effect we find is fairly substantial, increase out-of-pocket spending by widows
and the higher number of widows who are women cannot account for the majority of the gender
difference in total out-of-pocket medical spending by the elderly. Though we find that living
arrangements can explain more than the raw gender difference in nursing home spending, our
simulations suggest that living arrangements account for approximately 35 percent of the
difference in total out-of-pocket medical spending. The remainder could be due to a variety of
additional factors, such as gender differences in health status, health care utilization conditional
on health status, or insurance generosity. Examining the drivers of the gender differences
remains an important area for future research.
