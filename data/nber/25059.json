    "abstract": "\n\nEarly Childhood Development is becoming the focus of policy worldwide. However, the evidence on the effectiveness of scalable models is scant, particularly when it comes to infants in developing countries. In this paper we describe and evaluate with a cluster-RCT an intervention designed to improve the quality of child stimulation within the context of an existing parenting program in Colombia, known as FAMI. The intervention improved children\u2019s development by 0.16 of a standard deviation (SD) and children\u2019s nutritional status, as reflected in a reduction of 5.8 percentage points of children whose height-for-age is below - 1 SD.\n\n",
