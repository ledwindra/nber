The Cost of Annuities: Implications
for Saving Behavior and Bequests

ABSTRACT

The fact that most eldealy individuals in the United States choose
to maintain a flat age-wealth profile, rather than buy individual life

annuities, stands in contrast to central implications of the standard

life—cycle model of consumption—saving behavior. The analysis in this
paper lends support to an explanation for this phenomenon based either
on the cost of annuities, importantly including the element of that cost
due to adverse selection, or on the interaction of that cost and an
intentional

bequest motive.

Expected yields offered on individual life annuities in the United
States are lower by some 4-6%, or 2 1/2-4 1/2% after allowing for
adverse selection, than yields on alternative long—term fixed—income

investments. Simulations of an extended model of life-cycle saving and
portfolio behavior, allowing explicitly for uncertain lifetimes and
Social Security, show that yield differentials in this range can account
for the observed behavior, even in the absence of a bequest motive, during

the early years of retirement. By contrast, at older ages the combination

of yield differentials in this range and a positive bequest motive is
necessary to do so.

TEE COST OF ANNUITIES: IMPLICATIONS FOR SAVING BEHAVIOR AND BEOUESTS

Benjamin M. Friedman and Mark Warshawsky*

It is common experience that as we grow older
and nearer to eternity we become more, not less, anxious

about money. Derek Brewer, Chaucer and His World (p. 213).

It
saving

is startling, at least for economists 'fno view consumption—

behavior within the ftamerk of the familiar life cycle model,

to confront the fact that in the

United States

few individuals purchase

life annuities. According to the life cycle model, the chief principle
governing individual saving behavior is the desire to smooth consumption
patterns

over one' s lifetime, within the constraints imposed by limited

lifetime resources.1 Despite ample evidence of such smoothing behavior

with respect to short-run income fluctuations, age-wealth profiles show

little if any tendency for elder individuals to dissave out of available
resources as their remaining life expectancy shortens.2 This behavior would
be

understandable in terms of the standard life cycle model with risk—

averse individuals uncertain about their length of life, only if annuity

markets did not exist. Without access to life annuities, elder individuals
would conserve wealth to self—insure against the risk of having to reduce
consumption in later years if their life span turns out to be unexpectedly

long.3 Well-developed markets for life annuities do exist in the United
States, howeve'r. The puzzle is that so few people choose to use them.4
Some

of the potential answers to this puzzle bear important implications

not only for the theory of consumption—saving behavior but also for major

issues of public policy. Perhaps the most obvious possibility is that iflst
people

save (or, in old age, choose not to dissave) not for motives related

to the usual life cycle reasoning but, instead, to leave bequests to their

heirs.5 Although
cycle model

to

at

a

formal level

it is easy enough to modify the life

incorporate a bequest motive, the two rationales for saving

have strongly differing implications. If saving to fund intentional
bequests accounts for a large share of actual wealth holding, then familiar
life cycle conclusions, on issues as diverse as the efficacy of tax
incentives for capital formation and the economic effects of Social Security,
may

no longer hold.
An alternative explanation for the lack of participation in the

annuity market is that most individuals automatically receive life
annuities

from Social

Security and,

for

an increasing fraction of the labor

employer-sponsored pension plans. Nevertheless, it is difficult to
believe that the combination of Social Security and private pension coverage
force,

so precisely matches each individual's preferences for annuity holding
as to leave only minimal individual annuity demand remaining. Moreover,
although both Social Security and private pension coverage have grown

enormously just within recent decades, the minimal extent of individual

life annuity purchases in the

United States is apparently a phenosnon

of long standing.

A more plausible explanation,which again relegates intentional
bequests to a minor role and thereby rescues the life cycle model and its
implications, is that people shun individual annuities because they are not

priced "fairly" in the actuarial sense. A "load factor," depressing the
yield on an annuity below the corresponding actuarially fair yield, could
reflect ordinary transactions costs (including taxes and a competitive
return to the annuity issuer's capital at risk) , monopoly profits earned

by annuity issuers in imperfectly competitive markets, or

as discussed

at some length below — adverse selection among annuity purchasers.

—3—

Whatever its source, such a differential between the implicit expected
yield on annuities and the available yield on alternative forms of

wealth holding would clearly discourage annuity purchases. In the limit,
if the differential were large enough, standard models of consumption-

saving

behavior without annuity markets could again apply.

The object of this paper is to examine the pricing of individual

life annuities

in the United States, and to infer from the observed

market price structure the respective roles of actuarially unfair annuity
prices and the intentional bequest motive in explaining the puzzle that

so few individuals actually purchase such annuities. More specifically,
the questions addressed here are, first, how large the yield differential
actually is on readily available individual life annuities and, second,

whether

the

typically

yield differential is large enough to discourage a
risk-averse elder individual from buying annuities in the absence
observed

of a positive bequest motive.
annuities

In light of the great attention devoted to

in the theoretical literature of consumption—saving behavior,

together with the potential importance of actuarially unfair annuity prices
in explaining the observed behavior, it is surprising that (to the authors'
knowledge) no one has previously
Section

examined these data and their implications.

I presents data on the implicit yield on individual life

annuities in the United States during 1968-83, and compares these yields

to

those on alternative long—term fixed-income investment vehicles to

measure the effective cost of annuities. Section II, drawing on the work of
Fischer (1973) ,

describes a model representing the consumption-saving and

portfolio allocation behavior of an individual with uncertain lifetime,

who has access to a life annuity market but (in general) also values bequests.
Section III uses simulations of this model, based on observed annuity yield

differentials, to draw inferences about the respective roles of annuity
costs and a bequest motive in accounting for the typical individual's
preferences for maintaining a flat age-wealth profile instead of buying

annuities. Section IV briefly summarizes the paper's principal findings.

Yields on Individual Life Annuities

Table 1 presents calculations of the expected yields on individual
life annuities offered in the United States, during 1968—83, based on
annuity premiums quoted in successive issues of the A.M. Best Flitcraft

Compend.6 The premium underlying each reported calculation is that
quoted for a single-premium immediate annuity for 65-year—old males.
The assumed mortality probabilities underlying these calculations are
the general population mortality probabilities for 65-year-old males
reported in the 1970 and 1980 U.S. Life Tables, adjusted by a factor ot
.985 to reflect the 1.5% annual improvement in U.S. male mortality
probabilities that has occurred over the last two decades, and by a
further factor of .9925 to reflect the assumption of a future 0.75% annual
improvement in male mortality probabilities for all ages.7
The first column of Table 1 indicates the expected yield calculated
from the mean premium charged on this basic annuity contract by the ten

largest insurance companies in the United States. These data are probably
the most relevant for analyzing economy—wide individual behavior. The
largest insurers usually do business in all regions of the country, so
that the typical 65-year-old U.S. male has access to annuities at thLs

mean premium with little or no search costs. The associated expected
yield has risen over time as market interest rates have risen, although the
expected annuity yield has consistently remained well below the contemporary
yields on readily available fixed—income investments. This simple comparison
does not indicate that annuities are a 'dominated asset," however,

because the lifetime guarantee provided by an annuity is not available from
other investment vehicles.
The remaining columns of Table 1 indicate the potential returns to

market search by showing the dispersion of expected yields calculated
from the premiums charged for this same basic contract by different

insurers.9 The second and third columns show data for the highest and
lowest expected yields on this contract offered by any of the ten largest

insurers. Presumably most 65—year—old males have access to the highest
yields in this group at only modest search cost. The final column of the
table shows the highest expected yield on this contract offered by any

of the fifty—odd insurers in Best's sample. Because the smaller companies
in the sample do not necessarily maintain sales forces in all parts

of the country, however, there is no presumption that the typical
65—year-old male has ready access to this complete-sample highest yield.

If all individuals had identical mortality probabilities, the
spread between the calculated expected yields shown in Table 1

and some reference yield reflecting the typical individual's opportunity cost
would indicate the effective cost to the individual of the risk avoidance

that annuities provide. In fact, however, many individuals have
information that leads them to expect either a shorter or a longer life

than the population—wide average, By contrast, insurers typically
charge a uniform premium to all individuals of the same age and sex,

presumably because information about individual mortality probabilities

is too costly, or perhaps even impossible, to obtain and use. Individuals
expecting longer (shorter) than average lifespans will therefore perceive
that life annuities bear higher (lower) expected yields, and hence will
be more (less) likely to buy them.

10

This adverse selection — adverse

from the viewpoint of the insurer, that is —

will

lead to underwriting

losses if the insurer continues to charge a premium that is actuarially
fair to the population as a whole.

—7—

Table 2 therefore presents analogous calculations of the expected
yields on the same basic annuity contract for a 65-year-old male, based
on the same annuity premiums as before, but now based on alternative
mortality probabilities compiled from the actual company experience

on individual life annuity contracts issued in the United States during
1971—75, again adjusted as indicated above

to

reflect the improvement

in mortality probabilities.11 Figure 1 indicates the extent to which
the sub-population who choose to buy annuities in fact have a greater

survival probability than the general population. Because of this greater
life expectancy, the expected yields shown in Table 2 are greater than
the

corresponding values shown in

Table 1, based on general population

mortality

probabilities. Nevertheless, even these greater expected yields

resulting

from the actual company experience mortality probabilities are

still lower than the contemporary yields on readily available alternative

forms of wealth holding. Hence even the sub—population who voluntarily
buy annuities still face a negative yield differential repreenting the
cost of the protection from risk that the annuity provides.

Table 3 summarizes the cost of this basic annuity contract by
showing the 1968-83 mean values of the differential between the

expected yields shown in Tables 1 and 2 and two different market interest
rates: the 20-year U.S. government bond yield and the average yield

on corporate debt directly placed with insurance companies. From the
standpoint of an individual's opportunity cost of funds, the (lower)

yield on U.S. Government bonds is more relevant if the individual has no

better investment vehicle available. Increasingly, however, U.S. financial
intermediaries have offered individuals ways of buying shares in pools
of less liquid but higher—yielding assets.

The resulting average yield differentials shown in Table 3 range
from a minimum (in absolute value) of - .95% for the highest expected

yield offered by any company in Best's sample, compared to the Government
bond yield and based on actual company experience mortality probabilities,
to a maximum of -6.90% for the lowest yield offered by any of the ten
largest insurers, compared to the direct placement yield and based on

general population mortality probabilities. The differentials in the
table that are probably most relevant for studying economy—wide
individual behavior are those shown in the first row, for the mean expected
yield offered by the ten largest insurers, compared to the yield on
either Government bonds or direct placements, and based on either

general population or company experience mortality probabilities. These

differentials range from -2.43% to -6.13% — large values from some
perspectives, but not, for example, in comparison to the yield differential
that most individuals incur in holding money balances.

The question at issue here is whether these differentials are
sufficient to account for the preference for maintaining a flat age—wealth
profile over purchasing life annuities observed among the elderly population

in the United States. Since it is impossible to answer this question
on a purely empirical basis, some more formal.

analytical

approach is

necessary. Section II develops a suitable framework for analysis, and
Section III applies this framework in the context of the observed yield
differentials reported here.

A Model of Saving and 2nnuity Demand

The model developed here to analyze the demand for individual life
annuities in the context of life cycle saving and a bequest motive is an
annuity analog of Fischer's (1973) model of the demand for life insurance,
generalized

to incorporate fixed mandatory holdings of socially provided

annuities.12 Following Fischer, it is useful to represent the individual's
decision problem in this expanded life cycle context as the maximization

of expected lifetime utility

E(U) =

where w is the assumed maximum length

as of time t=O, Pt is the probability that an ind.ividual of age

that bt follows a hump-shaped pattern, with higher values during the

years when family dependency is important, and either level or declining
values during retirement years when children have typically become
financially independent,

The individual's problem is then to maximize (1), subject to a

initial wealth position and to a

wealth

in each subsequent time period, given

the

menu of available

investment opportunities (including any mandatory holding of socially

provided annuities) and their respective yields.15 In each period the
individual must decide not only how much of current wealth

to

consume but

also how to allocate the remainder among the available investment vehicles.
The specific asset menu considered here includes a riskiess one—period
bond bearing gross rate of return Rt, a one—period social annuity bearing

gross rate of return S to survivors, and a one—period market annuity

With little relevant loss of generality, it is

convenient to set Rt

The

dynamic programming solution to this problem proceeds from the

final period t=w-x-l, in which the certainty of death at the end of the

period (q=l) simplifies the problem of an individual who has survived to
that date to merely choosing C1 to maximize the sum of utility from current

The remainder of the dynamic programming solution proceeds backward

to the initial period t=O. in an analogous way. The expressions for
each period's optimal consumption and purchases of market annuities, and

for each period's value of the indirect utility function, are of the same
form (but with subscripts adjusted accordingly) as (12), (13) and (14),
respectively. Because the analytical properties of the model are not

sufficient

to address the more quantitative questions that are the focus

of this paper, however, Section III proceeds with numerical simulations of
the model under several different sets of assumptions about the crucial
bequest motive parameter and the cost of private annuities.

(16)

—14—

III. Simulation Results
The model developed in Section II generates lifetime streams of
consumption and annuity purchase values that are optimal for given

values of parameters describing preferences (,
environment (R,

c

and b) ,

the

market

and 2S) and mortality probabilities (p and q). The

principal focus of interest in this paper is on one aspect of preferences

and one aspect of the market environment — the bequest motive and the
cost (yield) of market annuities, respectively.
The strategy adopted here for representing the bequest motive
is simply to asunsne that the correspondence between bt in (3) and c

in (2) is just

=

0,

(17)

t=O,...,35

where B is a non—age-specific parameter indicating the individual's
life—long preference for bequests relative to current consumption,
given the other paraitters of the model, including in particular the
interest rate (R) ,

the

curvature of the utility function ()

, and

—

because B implicitly gives the relative weight of a stock (the bequest)
versus

a flow (consumption) — the assumed time unit of analysis. Given

B, the bequest amount is larger as R is higher, and smaller as

is higher.

For example, from (5)-(7) and (17), e takes the value (Gw—x/Cw—x—l
where

w—x/Cw—x—l )

(G

is

)

just the ratio of the final-period bequest to the

prior—period consumption. The normally limiting case for altruistic
bequests, in which an individual provides for his heirs' consumption at

the same level as his own, indicates (l/R—1) 35/R as the logical upper
bound on 0.18 In the simulations reported below, the strength of the
bequest motive is indicated by B and the corresponding bequest/consumption

—15—

ratio (G/C1) that would result under access to fair annuities,
given the other assumed

parameters.

The strategy used to represent the market for private annuities
is simply to assume that such annuities are readily available at some
expected yield differential

D =

Q(l_g1)

-

R.

(18)

In the simulations reported below, the values used for D include zero,

all four values shown in the top line of Table 3 for the expected yield
differential offered by the ten largest insurers (ranging from —2.43%
to —6.13%), and the smallest differential shown in Table 3 (-.95%, for
the highest yield offered by any company in Best's sample, compared to
the Government bond yield and based on actual company experience mortality

probabilities). Because these yield differentials are large enough in
some cases to induce an individual to want to act as if he were the

insurer by issuing rather than holding annuities against his own life —

that

mortality probabilities are those reported in the 1980 U.s. Life Tables.19
The upper panel of the table presents results based on morta]ity probabilities
for 65—year—old males, while the middle and lower panels present analogous
results for 70— and 75-year—old males, respectively.

For each set of assumed values, the solution of the model yields an
entire time series representing each year's consumption and each year's
division of privately held wealth (that is, wealth not mandatorily held in

social annuities) between bonds and private annuities 20 Given the
objective
the

of this paper, however, Table 4 reports

for each simulation only

optimal holding of private annuities at three specific ages, expressed

in each case as a percentage of total wealth.21 With one—half of total
wealth assumed to be held in social annuities, and with the nonnegativity
constraint imposed, the range of possible values of the share of wealth
held in private annuities is from zero to 50%.
The results shown in Table 4 suggest that, within the empirically
relevant range of variation for either D or 0, demand for individual
life annuities is sensitive both to the cost of annuities and to the

bequest motive. If annuities are actuarially fair and there is no bequest
motive, (that is, with D = 0 = 0)

,

the

optimal solution to the maximization

problem posed in Section II calls for stabilizing the lifetime consumption
stream completely by investing all of privately held wealth in private

annuities, so that A = 50.00%.

Either a negative yield differential or

a positive bequest motive makes annuities less attractive. The results
summarized in the table show how variations in D or 0, or both, reduce A
from

the 50.00% reference point.
These results suggest not only that the cost of annuities is a key

—17—

part of the explanation for the small participation in the market for
individual life annuities, but also that the adverse selection element

is a crucial part of that cost. Given the near absence of individual
annuity purchases, the real question at issue in these simulations is what
combinations of D and 0 are sufficient to drive optimal annuity holdings

to no more than a trivially small percentage of initial wealth. For 65—yearold males, for example, none of the values of 0 shown in Table 4 does so

in the absence of a negative expected yield differential. By contrast,
for each of the three largest (in absolute value) values of D considered,
the optimal portfolio allocation decision is to buy no private annuities at

all — regardless

of the presence or absence of a bequest motive. Reference

to Table 3 indicates that D = -2.43%, the largest value considered at

which it is optimal to hold any private annuities at all, is the differential
faced by an individual who knows that his mortality probabilities are like
those of other annuity purchasers rather than the general population, and
for whom the Government bond yield represents the opportunity cost of

funds. By contrast, D = -4.21%, the smallest value considered at which
it is optimal to hold no private annuities, is the differential faced by
a comparable individual without specific knowledge of his mortality
probabilities.

The results based on mortality probabilities for 70-year-old males

are essentially identical to those for 65—year-olds. For 75-year-olds,
however, the results differ in two interesting respects. First, for this
group positive private annuity holdings are optimal even at D = -4.21%
or -4.35% (although still not at -6.13%) .

Second, at these larger yield

differentials, a bequest motive corresponding to a bequest/consumption ratio
of nearly three is sufficient to reduce optimal private annuity holdings to

less than 15% of initial wealth. A more modest bequest motive still leaves

—18—

the optimal demand for private annuities implausibly large, however.

Although the simulation results summarized in Table 4 are sensitive
in at least some regard to each of the underlying assumptions, it is
especially interesting in this context to consider the implications of
an alternative assumption about the strength of individuals' risk aversion.

Because the basic purpose of an annuity is to insure against the consumption
risk associated with an uncertain lifetime, greater risk aversion
unambiguously implies a larger demand for annuities.

Table 5 therefore presents a corresponding set of results, identical
to those in Table 4 in every way except that the assumed coefficient of
relative risk aversion is

total wealth for 0

consumption ratio of 2.5. With a zero yield differential, 0 = 50 is
sufficient to reduce private annuity demand to only 12% of total wealth,

but the corresponding bequest/consumption ratio is implausibly high.23 The
results for 70-year-olds are again essentially identical. Finally, again
as in the results in Table 4, for 75-year-olds the combination of D =

-2.43

and 0 = 10 (bequest/consumption ratio of 2.5) is sufficient to reduce
private annuity demand to just over 15% of wealth. Similarly, with a
bequest motive of this strength private annuity purchases are barely positive

for D = -4.21% and are zero for D = -4.35%.
In sum, during the early retirement years the cost of annuities,

as represented by the expected yield differential, appears to be a

sufficient explanation for the observed general absence of participation
in the individual life annuity market in the United States, for either

level of risk aversion. By contrast, at older ages a combination of the
cost of annuities and a positive bequest motive, acting in conjunction,
is necessary to provide an explanation for this phenomenon within the
context of the analytical framework applied here.

IV.

Conclusions

and Caveats

The fact that most elderly individuals in the United States choose
to maintain a flat age-wealth profile, rather than buy individual life

annuities, stands in contrast to central implications of the standard

life—cycle model of consumption-saving behavior. The analysis in this
paper lends support to an explanation for this phenomenon based either
on the cost of annuities, importantly including the cost element due

to adverse selection, or on the interaction of that cost and an intentional
bequest motive.

Expected yields offered on individual life annuities in the
United States are lower by 4.21-6.13%, or 2.43-4.35% after allowing
for adverse selection, than yields on alternative long—term fixed—

income investments. Simulations of an extended model of life-cycle
saving and portfolio behavior, allowing explicitly for uncertain
lifetimes and Social Security, show that yield differentials in this
range can account for the observed behavior, even in the absence of a

bequest motive, during the early years of retirement. By contrast, at
older ages, the combination of yield differentials in this range and a
positive bequest motive can also do so.
As is usually the case with any initial analysis, caution is
appropriate in relying on these results without further research.
Although the model used in this analysis does generalize the standard
life cycle model in several potentially important ways, it still limits
the conclusiveness of the results by in effect excluding a priori three
further possible explanations for the observed behavior.24
First, informal discussions with insurers and financial advisors to
individuals suggest that many people choose stable age-wealth profiles, rather

—21—

than either
fear

buying annuities

or

simply

consuming out of

wealth, from

of the consequences of catastrophic illness. Although this

explanation seems to imply (counter to experience) that the introduction

of ?dicare should have changed the typical behavior in a readily visible

way, it is difficult to judge how much knowledge people actually have
about the Jdicare program — or, indeed, how much confidence they have
in

it.
Second, the entire analysis here, as in most of the literature to

date, is inlicitly in real terms. By contrast, the individual life
annuities available in U.S. markets guarantee specified nominal payments.

Insurers often argue that they would find little market for a "real
annuity" if they marketed such an instrument, but (to the authors' knowledge)

the experinnt is untried.
Third, while the analysis here employs the standard theory of

expected utility ma.xiinization, evidence exists that apparently contradicts

this theory as a description of decision making under risk, especially when

the prospect of rare events is involved. In particular, individuals appear
systematically to overweight the probability of rare events 25 The more
familiar implication of this psychological tendency is that it contributes
to the attractiveness of both gambling and insurance. In reverse, however,
it would also make annuities less desirable.

These further possible explanations for the fact that most of the

retired

elderly choose flat age—wealth profiles over purchases of individual

life annuities remain as objects for future research, so that the explanation
provided here in terms of actuarially unfair pricing (either with or

without a positive bequest motive) is necessarily tentative. Within the

—22—

limits of the analysis carried out here, however, the conclusions reported
in this paper point clearly toward the importance of actuarially unfair
annuities.

population own individual annuities of any sort; see for example,
Friedman and Sjogren (1980). A more specific example may further help
to illustrate the low level of activity in the individual life
annuity
market,: One large insurer, considered to be more active than average
in this market, sold an average of $18.5 million of individual life
annuities each year during 1980—83. By contrast, the same company's
annual sales of individual life insurance averaged $18.1 billion
during this period.

while life cycle saving accounts for "only a negligible fraction" of the
aggregate.

6. The expression used to calculate these yields is

w-x-l

P=

t=l

(l+r) -t

where P is the quoted per—dollar premium, w is the assumed maximum length

of life (here taken to be 110 years) ,
(here 65 years) ,

x

is the age at the date of issue
is the

r is the relevant interest rate, and

probability that an individual of age x at time t=1 will survive to
any year t>l. These annual calculations are then converted to a
monthly basis. The Appendix to Friedman and Warshawsky (1985) shows
that calculations for 65-year—old females, or for 70—year-old or 75-year—
old males, lead to results roughly similar to those for 65-year—old males.
7.

The calculations rely on the 1970 tables for years 1968-70, on the 1980
tables for years 1980-83, and on both tables (weighted) for years 1971-79.
See Faber (1982) for a complete description of the U.S. Life Tables,

and Wetterstrand (1983) for a discussion of improvements in mortality
probabilities.

8. The value of a 35-year certain annuity, calculated using the long—
term U.S. Government bond rate, exceeded the mean annuity premium
charged to 65—year—old males in all years of the sample except
1980, 1981 and 1982; see Friedman and Warshawsky (1985)
9. This dispersion probably reflects search costs; see, for example
Pratt et al. (1979) . Alternatively, it could reflect different
marketing choices by different insurers.

underlying this kind of adverse selection.

12. In fact, Fischer's model is really an annuity model, despite his
application of it to the demand for life insurance.

13. Probabilities Pt and

are, of course, conditional on initial age x.

Writing them as p(x)t and (x)1 would be appropriate but would clutter
an already cumbersome notation. Conditionality on x is to be understood,
here and below.
14. See Hakkanson (1969) for a discussion of the iso—elastic utility
function.
15.

In a more general context it would also be necessary to take account
of labor income. Th focus of this paper, however, is on the elderly
retired population.

16. As in Fischer (1973), the assumption of one-period annuities makes the
analysis tractable. The annuities actually available for purchase in
the United States are instead life annuities.
17. The model as written here imposes no nonnegativity constraint on
choice paramter A — that is, it does not explicitly preclude short
sales of annuities. The simulations reported in Section III below
impose A>0.

18. It is also possible, of course, to posit avarietyof circumstances
in which an altruistic individual may value his heirs' consumption
more than his own, so that 0 need not be bounded. In addition,
individuals may value bequests for non—altruistic reasons; see,
for example, Bernheim et al. (1984)

bequest equal to 2.1 times median annual labor income (defined as
one—fortieth of average annual labor earnings) , and a mean bequest
equal to 4.2 times mean annual labor income.
24. An additional factor explored by Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981)
intergenerational risk sharing within families could also possibly

explain the &bsence of individual life annuity purchases, but not
the flat age—wealth profile.
