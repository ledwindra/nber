ABSTRACT
In a recent paper, Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) argue that the large increases in population health
witnessed in the 20th century may have lowered income levels. We argue that this result depends crucially
on their assumption that initial health and income do not affect subsequent economic growth. Using
their data we reject this assumption in favor of a model of conditional convergence, with income adjusting
to its steady state over time. We show that, allowing for conditional convergence, exogenous improvements
in health due to technical advances associated with the epidemiological transition appear to have increased
income levels.

1. Introduction
In a recent paper, Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) present results indicating that increases in
population health, as measured by higher life expectancy, are negatively correlated with
economic growth in cross-country panel data. This appears to contradict much of the preceding
literature, surveyed in Weil (2007) and Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2004), which generally
finds that countries with better health achieve higher rates of economic growth.
Acemoglu and Johnson express three concerns about the findings of previous studies linking
population health to the growth of income per capita. The first concern involves the possibility
that the estimated positive coefficient of health in an empirical growth equation is biased upward
by the omission of some variable that is positively associated with both good health and high
income growth. As the authors argue, countries with low life expectancy may be disadvantaged
in other ways, so that the negative effects of other country-specific factors might be falsely
attributed to ill health. The second concern focuses on reverse causality from economic growth
to population health, since health depends on health inputs that are more affordable in richer
countries. The third issue is a general equilibrium effect of health on economic growth via lower
mortality and larger population numbers, an effect that will not be captured by individual-level
studies.
Given these concerns, Acemoglu and Johnson argue that the appropriate way to identify the total
effect of health on economic growth is empirical work at the aggregate level with valid
instrumentation to address the critical endogeneity issue. The instrument they propose depends
on exogenous shocks to national health generated by improvements in health technology.
Technological innovations in prevention and treatment occur for different diseases at different
times.2 They also affect health differently in each country since the prevalence of each disease
varies across countries.

2

We follow Acemoglu and Johnson in regarding disease specific technological advances as exogenous. However a
case could be made that research has focused on the diseases of rich countries, rather than poor countries, making
technological advances endogenous.

The issues raised by Acemoglu and Johnson are indisputably central to understanding the healthincome links. However, we argue that the discrepancy between the Acemoglu and Johnson
results and those reported in earlier literature is not a consequence of addressing these three
issues via a new instrument, but rather of the way in which the dynamic relationship between
health and income is modeled and estimated. Acemoglu and Johnson specify a formulation in
which current income is a function of, and adjusts instantaneously to, current health.
There are both theoretical and empirical reasons to expect income to adjust non-instantaneously
to changes in population health. The standard partial adjustment model that lies behind the
conditional convergence framework for modeling economic growth assumes that income
converges slowly its steady-state level; a convergence rate of about 2% per year is a common
estimate (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004; Durlauf, Johnson et al. 2005). It is likely that, when
health improves, income adjusts slowly to the new steady state. There is growing evidence that
physical and cognitive development are closely linked to health and nutrition in utero and during
the first few years of life. Health human capital may consequently be affected by conditions in
the early years of childhood, while the returns to this capital are realized mainly during a
person’s adult life (Heckman 2007). For example, Barker (1992) and Crimmins and Finch (2006)
find that early childhood infections have large effects on adult health. Behrman and Rosenzweig
(2004) find that development in utero, as measured by birth weight, has long-term economic
effects on adult productivity and earnings. Bleakley (2003; 2006) and Kremer and Miguel (2004)
find that early childhood exposure to disease has effects on educational outcomes while
(Hoddinott, Maluccio et al. 2008) find that early childhood nutrition has substantial effects on
adult income. Case, Fertig, and Paxson (2005) and Schultz (2005) provide further evidence of a
link between health in childhood and later economic success.
This empirical evidence suggests that health has a positive effect on income in the long term.
We are then left with the question why Acemoglu and Johnson find such a strong negative effect
of health improvements on growth in per capita income. As we show in the following section,
the negative correlation between changes in income and changes in life expectancy found by
Acemoglu and Johnson has little to do with instrumentation or the relatively small sample of 47
countries chosen by the authors. The reason this negative correlation emerges is simply that
2

countries with good health in 1940 were the ones that benefited least from subsequent global
health technology improvements, but are also the countries whose economies have grown fastest
since 1940. Acemoglu and Johnson ignore the effect of initial conditions on economic growth
and limit their attention to the unconditional negative correlation between health gains and
economic growth. Since there is strong convergence in health, countries with relatively good
initial health conditions have relatively smaller subsequent health gains (Cutler, Deaton et al.
2006). The unconditional regression of changes in income on changes in life expectancy omits
initial conditions as one of the fundamental drivers of subsequent economic growth. Since the
correlation between initial health conditions and subsequent changes in health is strongly
negative, the resulting estimates display a negative bias. The magnitude of the omitted variable
bias is large; once we control for initial conditions, the estimated effect of changes in life
expectancy on economic growth changes sign and becomes positive, with large and highly
significant coefficients both on initial levels of, and changes in life expectancy.
If the instrumental variable approach chosen by Acemoglu and Johnson were valid, this omitted
variable (or selection) bias would be irrelevant. A good instrument essentially mimics a random
assignment of health improvements, and thereby allows researchers to identify the causal effect
of health on income, independent of other omitted variables. Improvements in health technology
during the last century could be regarded as random shocks, and we could regard these
innovations as plausible instruments. Major advances in our understanding of infectious diseases
and the emergence of cheap and effective prevention and treatment interventions have indeed led
to rapid health improvements. Since the initial burden of disease varies across countries, these
health improvements provide differential positive shocks to all countries. Acemoglu and Johnson
discuss innovations developed for 15 prominent diseases in the early 20th century, ranging from
measles to tuberculosis to malaria3. They take “predicted mortality” to be the actual mortality
rate from these diseases in 1940, but once the cure for a specific disease is accessible to a
country, the predicted mortality from that disease is taken to be zero. The assumption that the
burden of malaria drops to zero after the intervention of DDT might appear odd from a historical

measles, diphtheria, scarlet fever, yellow fever, plague, typhus fever, and dysentery/diarrhea-related diseases.

perspective. It makes sense from an econometric perspective, however, as it avoids confounding
the exogenous health shock with endogenous domestic demand and implementation factors.
The problem with the instrument constructed by Acemoglu and Johnson is that it assumes the
predicted mortality to be exogenous and not affected by contemporaneous income shocks. This
implies that the initial mortality rate in 1940 due to each disease must be unaffected by income
levels in 1940. We think this is implausible, particularly given that the problem being addressed
is endogeneity of life expectancy, which is closely linked to mortality. We discuss this issue in
detail in the following for the case of malaria, arguing that malaria mortality in 1940 was
endogenous, with richer countries in 1940 being better able to afford vector control of
mosquitoes, such as swamp clearance.
To put it in the context of the evaluation literature, the “natural experiment” constructed by
Acemoglu and Johnson is flawed because the “treatment group” that received large health gains
from technological innovations is fundamentally different from the “control group” that received
low health gains. The treatment group, which benefits most from technological advances, had
poor health initially (low life expectancy) while the control group had good health (high life
expectancy). If initial health matters for subsequent economic growth, this difference between
the treatment and control groups will bias their result.
In our empirical analysis we focus on economic growth over the period 1940-2000. We expand
on the Acemoglu and Johnson model by allowing initial health and income to affect subsequent
economic growth. This can be regarded as adding what may be omitted variables to the model.
We also show formally that adding these explanatory variables makes the identifying assumption
in the model that disease specific mortality rates 1940 are uncorrelated with the income shock in
2000. This seems to us more plausible than the Acemoglu and Johnson assumption than that
1940 mortality is uncorrelated with the income shock in 19404. By controlling for initial health
and income we remove the correlation between the instrument and these previously omitted
variables. In this alternative framework, we show that improvements in life expectancy over the

period 1940-2000, instrumented with the change in predicted mortality due to technological
innovations, have a positive effect on the growth of income per capita.
To provide a clearer understanding of the results generated by Acemoglu and Johnson, we first
analyze the relationship between health, economic growth and predicted mortality in the data set
constructed by Acemoglu and Johnson in Section 2 of this paper. We show that there is a strong
positive correlation between initial health and subsequent economic growth. Since there is a
pronounced negative correlation between initial health and subsequent improvements in health, a
negative correlation between improvements in health and economic growth emerges. These
correlations are consistent with the view that good initial health leads to rapid subsequent
economic growth. They are, however, also consistent with the view that the correlation of
changes in income and health is negative.
In Section 3, we show formally that in the model used by Acemoglu and Johnson the identifying
assumption is that current income shocks do not affect current disease-specific mortality rates.
We also construct an alternative expanded model, in which the predicted mortality instrument
used by Acemoglu and Johnson is valid provided only that future income shocks do not affect
current disease-specific mortality. In Section 4 we report parameter estimates based on the two
models and show that while the Acemoglu and Johnson model finds a negative effect of health
improvements on economic growth, our model finds relatively large and highly significant
positive effects of health on income.

2. Patterns of Health and Economic Growth
We begin by examining the 47 data points used in Acemoglu and Johnson’s main regressions.
The data were provided by the authors and are as described in the original paper (Acemoglu and
Johnson 2007). Figure 1 shows the relationship between life expectancy in 1940 and growth in
income per capita over the period 1940-2000. The figure reveals a positive relationship:
countries with high life expectancy in 1940 had more rapid per capita income growth over the
period 1940-2000. Figure 2 shows the relationship between life expectancy in 1940 and the
growth rate of life expectancy during 1940-2000. Figure 2 shows that initial life expectancy
5

almost perfectly predicts subsequent percentage gains in life expectancy, with countries with low
initial life expectancy having the largest subsequent gains in life expectancy. This relationship
reflects a diffusion of health technologies that have allowed rapid health improvements even in
poor countries and overall convergence in life expectancy (Cutler, Deaton et al. 2006), though
there is evidence that not all countries are converging to the same steady state (Bloom and
Canning, 2008).
Figure 3 shows a negative relationship between growth in life expectancy over the period 19402000, and the growth rate of income per capita over the same period5. Figure 3 is a visual
representation of the Acemoglu and Johnson ordinary least squares estimates of the effect of
improvements in life expectancy on economic growth; the countries with above average gains in
life expectancy also have below average growth in income per capita over the period. These
patterns in the data are not due to the selection of particular countries or a particular time period.
In Figures 4-6 we plot the same relationships over the period 1970-2000 when data for 112
countries are available6. Data for income per capita are from the Penn World Tables 6.2 (Heston,
Summers et al. 2006), while data for life expectancy are from the World Development Indicators
2007 (World Bank 2007). This dataset is similar to that used in most recent studies of the effect
of health on economic growth. In Figure 4 we see once again a positive relationship between
initial life expectancy (in 1970), and subsequent economic growth (over the period 1970-2000).
In Figure 5 we see once again a negative relationship between initial life expectancy (in 1970)
and the subsequent change in life expectancy (over the period 1970-2000). Last, Figure 6 shows
a negative relationship during the period 1970-2000 between growth in life expectancy and
growth in income per capita.
Most of the literature on the relationship between health and growth focuses on the positive link
between initial health and subsequent economic growth as seen in Figure 1 and Figure 4. The
major innovation of Acemoglu and Johnson is not to instrument health in this relationship, but to
5

Following Acemoglu and Johnson, we use log differences as our measure of growth in life expectancy and income
per capita. In Figures 1-6, we convert the long-term growth figures into annual growth rates by dividing the log
difference by the number of years between the two observations.
6
We exclude countries with HIV prevalence rates over 3% from these figures. HIV dominates the improvements
made with respect to all other diseases in high-prevalence countries and makes the comparison of aggregate time
trends in life expectancy rather difficult.

6

shift the emphasis to the negative relationship between growth in life expectancy and growth in
income per capita as seen in Figure 3 and Figure 6.
However, if the relationships in Figures 1 and 2 are causal, the relationship in Figure 3 becomes
difficult to interpret. Suppose high initial life expectancy does lead to economic growth as
suggested by Figure 1. Suppose in addition that low initial life expectancy leads to a high rate of
growth in life expectancy as suggested by Figure 2. Combining these two mechanisms we would
expect to see that countries with high initial life expectancy in 1940 have high rates of economic
growth over the period 1940-2000 and relatively low rates of growth of life expectancy over the
same period. Failing to take account of both mechanisms can yield a spurious negative
correlation between growth in income and growth in life expectancy, even if the true relationship
is positive.
Acemoglu and Johnson continue to find a negative coefficient on growth in life expectancy in
regressions explaining growth in income per capita even when they instrument the change in life
expectancy with predicted mortality change. The predicted mortality variable they construct is
the total number of deaths per 100 people living in a given country attributable to 15 diseases
that underwent significant advances in prevention or treatment over the period. Predicted
mortality is the actual number of deaths prior to the health innovation, and is set to zero
thereafter. The countries with the largest declines in predicted mortality are therefore the
countries with high initial mortality, which means low initial life expectancy.
Figure 7 plots changes in predicted mortality, the Acemoglu and Johnson instrument, against the
log of initial life expectancy in 1940. This graph shows that the countries that experienced the
largest health improvements (largest reductions in predicted mortality) are those with the lowest
initial life expectancy. This instrument is clearly not a random assignment. Its validity depends
on being able to exclude initial income as an explanatory variable for subsequent economic
growth. If this exclusion is not possible, the instrument will be correlated with growth via its
correlation with initial life expectancy as well as through its correlation with growth in life
expectancy.

7

An intuitive way of illustrating our point about the implausibility of the predicted mortality
change instrument is to look at the analysis presented from a natural experiment perspective. Let
us define the set of 47 countries analyzed by Acemoglu and Johnson as our sample and
hypothetically divide the sample into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group
gets a large shock (i.e., a relatively big increase in life expectancy), while the control group gets
only a small shock (i.e., a relatively small increase or even a decline in life expectancy).
Following Angrist and Pischke (2009), let us define Di = {0,1} to be the treatment indicator for
country i, Δyi to be growth in income as the outcome variable, and Δyi 0 to be income growth in
the absence of the treatment. The observed difference in growth is then given by
E[Δyi | Di = 1] − E[Δyi | Di = 0] = E[Δyi | Di = 1] − E[Δyi 0 | Di = 1] + E[ Δyi 0 | Di = 1] − E[ Δyi 0 | Di = 0]
Observed difference

Treatment effect on the treated

Selection bias

which nicely summarizes the issue at hand. The observed difference between the treatment group
(countries with generally low life expectancy in 1940) and the control group (countries with
generally high life expectancy in 1940) is the sum of the true treatment effect of improved health
and the difference in growth patterns in the absence of the treatment. The observed differences
reflect the true treatment effect if there are no differences in expected growth between the
treatment and control group in the absence of the health shock. In the sample used in the
Acemoglu and Johnson case, this assumption seems quite implausible; treatment is associated
with low initial life expectancy which is correlated with low subsequent economic growth, as
shown in Figure 1. This implies a negative selection bias. Countries in the control group share
initial conditions associated with higher subsequent income growth. This means that countries in
the treatment group would have done worse in terms of economic performance in the absence of
health improvements than countries in the control group. Observing a negative growth difference
between the treatment and control groups does thus not permit any inferences about a possible
causal effect of health on income per capita.
Table 1 shows a correlation matrix of the variables plotted in Figures 1-4. Note that the change
in predicted mortality is just the negative of predicted mortality in 1940, since predicted
mortality in 2000 is uniformly set to zero. The correlation between initial life expectancy and
8

subsequent economic growth is 0.50, while the correlation between predicted mortality in 1940
and life expectancy in 1940 is -0.70. Both correlations are significant at the 1% confidence level.
Since initial life expectancy is not accounted for in the empirical specifications implemented by
Acemoglu and Johnson, the instrument is correlated with an excluded variable, which will
induce inconsistent estimates if this excluded variable is relevant for the model.

3. Model Specification
We now address the issue of the dynamics of the relationship between health and income more
formally. The main estimates presented in Acemoglu and Johnson are built around the following
empirical specification:
yit = α + π xit + β zit + ui + δ t + ε it

(1)

where yit is the outcome variable in country i at time t , xit is log life expectancy, zit represents
other explanatory variables, ui are country fixed effects, δ t are time dummies and ε it is an error
term. Acemoglu and Johnson analyze log total population, log total GDP, log GDP per worker,
and log GDP per capita as outcome variables, although the main focus of their study is on the
effect of life expectancy on GDP per capita. We focus solely on log GDP per capita as the
outcome. In addition, while equation (1) can be run as a panel we focus on the case where we
analyze only two time periods, the “long difference”, with data from 1940 and 2000. There is an
important assumption in equation (1) that health can be reduced to a single measure and can be
measured by life expectancy, which may be disputed (Weil 2007; Bleakley 2008).
One critique of Acemoglu and Johnson is that they do not control for a sufficient number of
alternative possible explanatory variables zit . They do show that their results are robust to
including average institutional quality, and initial population, interacted with a post-intervention
dummy, but other variables could be added. In the empirical section below we investigate adding
initial life expectancy and initial income, interacted with a post-intervention dummy, as
additional explanatory variables.

9

A second, though as we shall see related, critique concerns the validity of the instrument used by
Acemoglu and Johnson. Acemoglu and Johnson argue that life expectancy in equation (1) is not
exogenous, since income is likely to affect health, so that estimating this relationship by ordinary
least squares (OLS) will yield biased results. They propose an instrument, predicted mortality, to
avoid this endogeneity problem. Predicted mortality M itI (mortality from diseases with a health
innovation I in the sample period) is given by

M itI = ∑ [ (1 − I dt ) M di 0 + I dt M dFt ]

(2)

d ∈D

where M di 0 is the mortality rate from disease d in country i at time 0, which is taken to be 1940,
and I dt is a dummy taking the value zero prior to technological innovation in disease d and a
value of one after the innovation. M dFt denotes the frontier mortality in the disease post
intervention, taken to be zero for their baseline instrument. In the “long difference” comparison,
where period 0 is 1940 and period 1 is 2000, this reduces to

M iI0 = ∑ M di 0 , M iI1 = 0

(3)

d ∈D

Predicted mortality in 1940 is just the sum of observed mortality rates in the diseases under
consideration while predicted mortality in 2000 is zero (or at the frontier if the alternative
instrument used) since every disease considered has an innovation before 2000. The assumption
required for this instrument to be valid is that it is uncorrelated with ε it , the error term in equation
(1); that is, Cov( M itI , ε it ) = 0 . Given that the instrument is zero for all countries in 2000 this

reduces to the assumption that in 1940 the sum of observed mortality rates in the diseases under
consideration is uncorrelated with the error term in 1940, that is, Cov( ∑ M di 0, ε i 0 ) = 0 . We
d ∈D

derive this formally in Appendix I below. While Acemoglu and Johnson argue that this is
plausible, our view is that it is not.
The problem being addressed is potential reverse causality from income to life expectancy. Such
income effects on health seem likely since higher income can improve individual nutrition and
access to health care as well as increase the availability of government funds for public health
10

measures, all of which are likely to reduce mortality. For the predicted mortality instrument to
be valid, Acemoglu and Johnson have to argue that shocks to income in 1940, while affecting
mortality and life expectancy in 1940 overall, do not affect mortality rates in the 15 diseases they
consider, which seems highly unlikely. We can illustrate this with the example of malaria.
Acemoglu and Johnson date technological innovation in malaria to 1947, with the recognition by
the Expert Committee on Malaria (1947) that DDT was an effective insecticide against
mosquitoes. However, urbanization, vector control based on management and drainage of water
sources, the use of insecticides, and access to quinine, had already substantially reduced the
burden of malaria in the United States and Italy by 1947, though at a high financial cost, while
malaria control efforts in India were hampered by lack of funds (Snowden 2006; Packard 2007).
Assuming that the initial burden is exogenous implies assuming that none of the factors
explaining the relatively low death burden in Italy and the United States as compared to India in
1940 has any explanatory power for income in 1940, which seems hard to defend.
We can get a clearer picture of the likely bias introduced by this endogeneity by considering
equation (1) in first differences. With two time periods only and country fixed effects, it is easy
to see that equation (1) can be rewritten as a first difference model given by:
Δyi = δ + πΔxi + β Δzi + Δε i

(4)

where Δyi = yi1 − yi 0 is the growth rate (log difference) of income per capita between period zero
and period one (1940 and 2000), Δxi = xi1 − xi 0 is the growth rate (log difference) of life
expectancy, and Δzi = zi1 − zi 0 is the change in other explanatory variables, in country i over the
same period. All country-specific time-invariant factors are differenced out, and the constant in
the growth equation δ = δ1 − δ 0 represents the change in the time dummies. The error term in the
growth equation is Δε i = ε i1 − ε i 0 . We can write the first difference of the predicted mortality
instrument as
ΔM iI = M iI1 − M iI0 = 0 − M iI0 = − ∑ M di 0
d ∈D

11

(5)

The change in predicted mortality is just the negative of the predicted mortality in 1940 since
mortality in the diseases with new technologies is assumed to go to zero by 2000. The regression
(4) using the first differenced predicted mortality (5) gives numerically identical results to
running the levels regression (1) for 1940 and 2000 with the level of predicted mortality in levels
from equation (3) as the instrument. The problem of endogeneity of the instrument remains. In
first differences the condition for instrument validity is

Cov(ΔM iI , Δε i ) = Cov(− ∑ M di 0, ε i1 −ε i 0 ) = 0

(6)

d ∈D

However, if as we have argued above, mortality in the 15 diseases in 1940 is correlated with the
income shock in 1940 this covariance will not be zero, unless ε i1 − ε i 0 is uncorrelated with ε i 0 ,
which is unlikely.7
Acemoglu and Johnson argue that variations in M itI are unrelated to any actions or economic
events in the country, which makes predicted mortality a plausible exogenous instrument. We
agree with this assessment for the dummy I dt : global technological progress in these diseases is
plausibly uncorrelated with each country’s economic actions. However, the other component of
the instrument is disease-specific mortality rates. Our view is that this component reflects current
health conditions in the country, and life expectancy itself, is endogenous to current income.
Interacting this endogenous component with the dummy for a technological innovation, or first
differencing, does not remove the endogeneity.
We could stop here and conclude that the predicted mortality instrument is unlikely to be valid,
either in levels or in first differences. However, we can derive an equation in which predicted
mortality is a plausibly valid instrument. We can rewrite equation (4) as
Δyi = δ + πΔxi + β Δzit + (α + ui + π xi 0 + β zi 0 − yi 0 ) + ε i1

(7)

where we have substituted for the base line income shock ε i 0 in the differenced error using
equation (1). This formulation allows for an effect of change on life expectancy on change in
income as in Acemoglu and Johnson. However, we also have a conditional convergence term.
7

ε i1 − ε i 0 and ε i 0 will be uncorrelated only if ε it is a random walk; we test and decisively reject this condition on

the data below.

12

Countries with high life expectancy and low income in 1940, which are therefore below their
steady-state income levels, will be expected to have faster economic growth. The advantage of
equation (7) is that the condition for the change in predicted mortality to be a valid instrument is
now:

Cov(ΔM iI , ε i1 ) = Cov(− ∑ M di 0, ε i1 ) = 0

(8)

d ∈D

This seems reasonable. All we require is that mortality rates in the 15 diseases in 1940 are
uncorrelated with the shock to income in 2000. While income shocks are likely to be correlated
over time it seems plausible that any correlation will have disappeared over a 60-year period.
The advantage of equation (7) is that in this formulation the predicted mortality change is a valid
instrument. This equation makes explicit the point that the equation estimated by Acemoglu and
Johnson, equivalent to equation (7) but without the term in brackets, suffers from omitted
variable bias, and it is the correlation with these omitted variables that is likely to make their
instrument invalid.
Given the 60-year gap between 1940 and 2000, the assumption that the error terms in levels are
uncorrelated is plausible; any disequilibrium in 1940 should have worked itself out by 2000.
However it is desirable to test this assumption. Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2004) examine a
model where the error term is autocorrelated over time and has the structure

ε it = (1 − λ )ε i ,t −1 + υit

(9)

where υit is are independent identically distributed shocks, uncorrelated with ε i ,t −1 . This implies
that in the growth equation the residual is given by

Δε it = −λε i ,t −1 + υit

(10)

And we can derive the growth model between two periods, 0 and 1, from equation (1) as

Δyi = δ + πΔxi + βΔzit + λ (ui + δ 0 + π xi 0 + β zi 0 − yi 0 ) + υi1

(11)

by replacing the lagged error term with the disequilibrium in the previous period. Note that in
this case not all of the disequilibrium in one period is undone in the next period. Instead we have
an error correction framework where income adjusts slowly to any disequilibrium between
income and its steady-state level given initial health. While the residuals ε it are correlated over
13

time, the shock υit is uncorrelated with any variables measured at time t-1, and these beginningof-period variables, such as the predicted mortality change that depends only on mortality in the
initial period, can be used as exogenous variables or instruments when estimating equation (11).
The model (11) is an encompassing model. It contains as a special case the models with
uncorrelated errors in the level equation (1), which corresponds to λ = 1 , giving equation (7). It
also contains as a special case the model where the errors in the level relationship are a random
walk, which corresponds to λ = 0 in equation (9). In this case the model reduces to the regression
estimated by Acemoglu and Johnson since, the initial levels of health and income do not affect
economic growth.
Over short time intervals we expect λ to be small, but over long time intervals λ will approach 1
as all of the initial disequilibrium is corrected. Cate (2004) provides a detailed discussion of the
relationship between an underlying continuous time error correction mechanism and the value of

λ when the process is measured at different discrete time intervals.
4. Regression Results

Table 2 reports regression results using the 47 country Acemoglu and Johnson data. For every set
of results, the dependent variable is growth in per capita income during 1940-2000. In column 1
of Table 2 we replicate the Acemoglu and Johnson results from a regression of growth in income
per capita on the change in log life expectancy. The point estimate of -1.142 (statistically
significant) implies that a 10% increase in life expectancy leads to an 11.4% decrease in GDP
per capita. In column 2 of Table 2 we follow Acemoglu and Johnson and instrument the change
in log life expectancy with predicted mortality change. We find exactly the same result as
Acemoglu and Johnson: the effect of growth in life expectancy on income growth is negative (a
coefficient of -1.51), and statistically significant. With only two time periods the Acemoglu and
Johnson fixed effects model in levels is equivalent to our first differenced model.
We begin by investigating the issue of omitted variable bias and test the robustness of the model
to the inclusion of other possible explanatory variables. A key issue is whether initial health, as
14

measured by initial life expectancy, should be included in the growth model, as suggested by
Figure 1. In column 3 of Table 2, we report the results of using OLS to estimate the parameters
of a growth model that is augmented to include initial log life expectancy8. The inclusion of
initial life expectancy reverses the result found in column 1: both initial log life expectancy and
the change in log life expectancy are estimated to have positive and significant effects on
economic growth. This means that the economies that grew fastest during 1940-2000 are those
that had the highest life expectancies in 1940 and those that saw the fastest growth in life
expectancy during 1940-2000.
We repeat the regression in column 3 but instrument growth in life expectancy with predicted
mortality change and report the results in column 4 of Table 2. None of the resulting coefficient
estimates are statistically significant. The problem with this specification is that once we
condition on initial life expectancy, the instrument completely loses predictive power for
changes in life expectancy in the first-stage regression. The Cragg-Donald F-Statistic of 0.137
implies that predicted mortality has virtually zero predictive power on subsequent changes in life
expectancy when we control for initial life expectancy. Predicted mortality in 1940 is highly
correlated with life expectancy in 1940 and once we condition on initial life expectancy the
instrument becomes extremely weak.
In column 5 we add initial log income per capita to the model to estimate a more standard
conditional convergence model. The addition of initial income has little impact on the OLS
results. While we find a negative coefficient on initial GDP as is usual in conditional
convergence models, the inclusion of initial GDP increases the estimated effect of both initial
health and health improvements on economic growth. The fastest growing countries during
1940-2000 are those with low initial income, high initial life expectancy, and large increases in
life expectancy during 1940-2000. We also try to estimate the parameters of this model using
change in predicted mortality as an instrument for the improvement in life expectancy; the results
are reported in column 6 of Table 2. Once again, the instrument is too weak in the first stage to
allow for a proper identification of the model.
8

This is equivalent to adding initial life expectancy interacted with a year dummy as an explanatory variable in the
levels equation (1). This interaction is the same as carried out by Acemoglu and Johnson when they consider the
robustness of their model to the inclusion of other variables.

15

One could argue that the instrument is invalid in column 3 because it is correlated with an
relevant omitted variable, initial log life expectancy. By this logic, the instrument is valid in
columns 4 and 6 since we control for initial health. However the instrument is now too weak to
identify the effect of growth in life expectancy since it is highly correlated with initial life
expectancy. These results imply that the Acemoglu and Johnson result is not robust to the
inclusion of additional explanatory variables that are plausibly related to economic growth. With
the addition of initial health as an explanatory variable in the growth regression the predicted
mortality instrument is too weak to give meaningful results.
An alternative, however, is to estimate the parameters of the relationship set out in equation (11).
This contains initial income per capita as well as initial log life expectancy and the growth in life
expectancy as explanatory factors for the growth in income per capita. However, this model also
has a parameter restriction not employed in the estimates reported in columns (5) and (6) of
Table 2. The coefficients on the growth in life expectancy and initial log life expectancy, in the
error correction component, are the same. This parameter restriction aids identification of the
model.
Table 3 reports nonlinear least squares estimates of the parameters of equation (11) on the same
data as used in Table 2 to explain growth in income per capita during 1940-2000. The effect, π ,
of initial life expectancy and the growth in life expectancy on economic growth are the same. We
estimate a large effect of health on economic growth. In column 1 of Table 3 we estimate the
relationship with non-linear least squares. We find a value of λ that is not significantly different
from unity, indicating that all of the disequilibrium in 1940 between income and health appears
to be corrected by the year 2000 through adjustments in income. This means that the income
shock in 1940 and the shock in 2000 appear to be uncorrelated. In addition, the coefficient λ
appears to be significantly different from zero, which is the condition Acemoglu and Johnson
require for their approach to be valid (so that initial health and income can be excluded from the
growth regression). We find that the coefficient on health (the common coefficient on initial
health and the change in health) is positive, indicating a positive correlation between health and
economic growth.
16

The main concern here, however, is that the change in log life expectancy Δxi in equation (11) is
endogenous to the growth in income. In column 2 of Table 3 we therefore instrument the change
in log life expectancy with the predicted change in mortality. Note that this is now a plausibly
valid instrument because the shock to the growth equation (11) depends only on the income
shock in 2000, while the change in predicted mortality depends only on disease specific
mortality measured in 1940. Using this instrument we again find positive and significant effects
of health on growth. In columns 4 and 6 of Table 2 we estimate the effects of initial health and
the change in health during 1940-2000 separately and the instrument is very weak. In column 2
of Table 3 identification essentially comes from the equality of the parameters on initial health
and the growth in health in equation (11).
In the regression in column 2 of Table 3 we treat initial life expectancy and initial income per
capita in 1940 as exogenous, which means that they are assumed to be uncorrelated with the
income shock υi1 in 2000. Rather than using predicted mortality change as our instrument for
change in life expectancy we can simply use initial life expectancy as the instrument. While
initial life expectancy is in the regression already, this instrument leads to identification because
of the parameter restriction in equation (11). The results from using initial life expectancy as the
instrument, reported in column 3 of Table 3, are very similar to those found by using predicted
mortality change. In addition to the change in life expectancy being endogenous, we can also
consider initial life expectancy as endogenous and instrument both with the change in predicted
mortality. This corresponds to the argument that both initial life expectancy and the growth in
life expectancy are potentially endogenous, but the change in predicted mortality is a valid
instrument. The results of this regression are reported in column 4 of Table 3, and as before, the
effect of health on income is positive and significant.
The results in Table 3 suggest that the coefficient λ on the error correction component of growth
is unity. This means that the error terms in levels in equation (1) for 1940 and 2000 appear to be
uncorrelated. In each regression in Table 3 we find a coefficient that is not significantly different
from one. In Table 4 we repeat the regressions in Table 3 but impose the condition that λ = 1 .
The resulting estimated parameter for the effect of health on income is positive and significant in
17

each specification. Column 4 of Table 4 corresponds most closely to Acemoglu and Johnson’s
original approach. We substitute out the 1940 income shock to give equation (7), where we argue
the predicted mortality change instrument becomes valid. We then instrument both initial log life
expectancy and the change in log life expectancy with the predicted mortality instrument. The
result is a large, significant, positive coefficient for the effect of life expectancy on income.
The estimate of the health effect is very sensitive to the extent of error correction. For low values
of λ there is little effect of initial health on economic growth. In this case the negative
relationship between the growth in life expectancy and the growth in income per capita, shown in
Figure 2, dominates the estimate, and health improvements appear to lower income per capita.
For large values of λ initial health has a greater impact on income growth, and the positive
association between initial health and subsequent economic growth, shown in figure one,
dominates the estimate and health improvements appear to raise income per capita. The critical
value for λ is around 0.75, with larger values being required to generate positive effects of
health improvements on income. We estimate a value of λ close to one, but the sensitivity of
the estimated health coefficient to the value of λ should give us some pause. The fundamental
reason for this sensitivity is the high degree of co-linearity between initial life expectancy, and
the growth in life expectancy, shown in figure 2. It is intrinsically difficult to estimate separately
the effects of the initial level, and the growth rate, of life expectancy using this data.
The results in Tables 2-4 require a large number of assumptions and are sensitive to the
specification used; we do not regard them as definitive. Our goal is only to put the Acemoglu and
Johnson results in context, and show they can be reversed in a more general model. Further
generalizations are possible. A richer error structure than the simple autoregressive process set
out in equation (9) would lead to a more complex model. In estimating equation (11) we neglect
the fixed effects and the effect of other explanatory variables. It is difficult to include these fixed
effects explicitly. In the long difference model we have only one observation in first differences.
In a panel data setting with shorter time intervals and more observations we have dynamic panel
with a lagged endogenous variable, leading to well-known difficulties (Nickell 1981; Arellano

18

and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998)9. Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2004) estimate the
model set out in equation (11) in a panel of countries using a set of factors that are fixed within
countries over time, such a geography and climate, to capture country-specific effects, and
include other time-varying factors that may affect income per capita, such as capital
accumulation. They continue to find a positive effect of health on economic growth, suggesting
that the positive results found here are robust to including these variables.

5. Conclusion

The Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) results are striking. The idea that health improvements
actually reduce income per capita is counterintuitive and, if true, of great practical importance
with respect to the allocation of resources to the promotion and protection of population health.
We argue here that the Acemoglu and Johnson result hinges critically on a specification in which
economic growth depends on contemporaneous health improvements only, so that lagged health
has no effect. There are strong reasons to expect that the response of income to health
improvements is not instantaneous, and that there is a lagged effect. Allowing for this lagged
effect produces positive estimates for the effects of both lagged health and of improvements in
health on the growth of income per capita, and thus reverses the results found by Acemoglu and
Johnson.
While we find positive results, we are left with a situation in which we are not yet able to make
definitive inferences about the effect of population health on economic growth. There is a strong
positive correlation between a country’s initial life expectancy and its subsequent economic
growth, but it is difficult to offer compelling evidence that the effect is causal. We still lack a
randomized intervention, or an indisputably compelling instrument, for initial health at the
macroeconomic level that would allow us to identify this effect of initial life expectancy as
causal and not the result of omitted variable bias.

9

Method of moments give asymptotically unbiased estimators in this setting but we found that a Monte Carlo study
using generated data gave very unreliable results.

19

While we disagree with the results found by Acemoglu and Johnson we think their paper has
identified three crucial issues that are not yet resolved. The first issue is the endogenity of health
and the need for modeling that allows causal inference. The second issue is timing. Any effect of
health improvements that increases income levels clearly takes some time - with slow
convergence to a steady state, rather than a contemporaneous jump, the best we can hope for.
The third is the indirect effect of health on population size, and the resulting pressure on scarce
resources and income levels. Previous studies may have erred in controlling for population
effects rather than treating these as endogenous.
We have focused on the overall effect of health on income, which includes labor productivity
and savings, as well as population effects. We agree that the population mechanism may lead to a
negative effect of health on income in the short run, particularly since the labor productivity
effects of early childhood health may take years to realize. However, in the longer run,
improvements in mortality tend to lead to reduced fertility. A central question is whether induced
reductions in fertility are sufficient to offset the population increase due to lower mortality, and
how quickly the fertility response materializes (Ashraf, Lester et al. 2008).

since by construction predicted mortality at time 1 is zero so M iI1 = 0. Hence, given that some
observations in the dataset are at time zero (so that P (t = 0) >0), we have

Cov( M itI , ε it ) = 0 ⇔

E ( M itI ε it ) = 0 ⇔ E ( M iI0ε i 0 ) = 0 ⇔ Cov( M iI0 , ε i 0 ) = 0 (15)
