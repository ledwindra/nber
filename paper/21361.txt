The adoption of new clinical practice patterns by medical care providers is often challenging, even
when they are believed to be both efficacious and profitable. This paper uses a randomized field experiment
to examine the effects of temporary financial incentives paid to medical care clinics for the initiation
of prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy. The rate of early initiation of prenatal care was
34% higher in the treatment group than in the control group while the incentives were being paid,
and this effect persisted at least 24 months or more after the incentives ended. These results are consistent
with a model where the incentives enable providers to address the fixed costs of overcoming organizational
inertia in innovation, and suggest that temporary incentives may be effective at motivating improvements
in long run provider performance at a substantially lower cost than permanent incentives.

1 INTRODUCTION	  	  
Successful	  organizations	  are	  able	  to	  efficiently	  and	  reliably	  produce	  high	  quality	  products	  through	  
the	   use	   of	   reproducible	   and	   stable	   routines.1	   Routines	   shape	   the	   production	   process	   by	   defining	  
each	   person’s	   role,	   their	   patterns	   of	   action,	   and	   by	   coordinating	   the	   tasks	   performed	   by	   the	  
different	   team	   members.2	   They	   can	   be	   thought	   of	   as	   organizational	   habits	   that	   reduce	   the	  
complexity	  of	  decision-­‐making,	  facilitate	  coordination	  across	  team	  members,	  and	  speed	  production.	  
However,	  once	  established,	  routines	  are	  costly	  to	  change.	  The	  cost	  of	  adjustment	  includes	  the	  time	  
and	   money	   needed	   to	   retool	   routines,	   an	   adjustment	   period	   in	   which	   production	   is	   less	   reliable	  
while	   the	   new	   routines	   are	   being	   learned,	   and	   possibly	   psychological	   resistance	   to	   change.	   As	   a	  
result,	   organizations	   tend	   to	   be	   resistant	   to	   adopting	   structural	   changes	   that	   are	   thought	   to	   be	  
productive	   and	   profitable	   (Hannan	   and	   Freeman	   1984;	   Carroll	   and	   Hannan	   2000).	   While	  
organizational	   routines	   are	   necessary	   for	   efficient	   and	   reliable	   production,	   they	   can	   result	   in	  
organizational	  inertia	  to	  innovation.	  

                                                            Nowhere	  are	  organizational	  routines	  more	  important	  than	  in	  the	  production	  of	  medical	  care	  
services	  (Hoff	  2014).	  Medical	  care	  entails	  coordinating	  a	  large	  complex	  set	  of	  tasks	  such	  as	  deciding	  
what	   information	   to	   collect	   from	   the	   patient,	   assessing	   social	   and	   medical	   risks,	   deciding	   what	  
diagnostic	   tests	   to	   prescribe,	   interpreting	   symptoms	   and	   test	   results,	   and	   prescribing	   and	  
implementing	   treatments.3	   	   Typically,	   a	   team	   coordinated	   by	   a	   physician	   implements	   these	   tasks.	  
Nurses	   often	   take	   medical	   and	   social	   histories,	   conduct	   preliminary	   physical	   exams,	   and	   administer	  
injections.	   Laboratory	   technicians	   analyze	   blood	   and	   urine.	   Pharmacists	   dispense	   drugs	   and	  
monitor	   negative	   drug	   interactions.	   Physical	   and	   occupational	   therapists	   provide	   rehabilitation	  
services.	   Community	   health-­‐workers	   provide	   outreach,	   promotion	   and	   preventive	   services,	   and	  
follow-­‐up	  care	  to	  patients.	  Clinics	  establish	  practice	  routines	  that	  are	  consistent	  with	  their	  training	  
and	  experience	  to	  standardize	  and	  coordinate	  care.	  	  



	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
                        1	  Organizational	  routine	  has	  been	  studied	  extensively	  since	  popularized	  by	  Nelson	  and	  Winter	  (1982).	  In	  a	  

review	   of	   the	   literature	   Becker	   (2004)	   defines	   routines	   as	   “recurrent	   interaction	   patterns”	   within	   an	  
organization,	  or	  as	  “established	  rules,	  or	  standard	  operating	  procedures”.	  
   2	   Often	   relationships	   between	   team	   members	   and	   management	   are	   enforced	   by	   informal	   relational	  

contracts	  (Gibbons	  and	  Henderson	  2012	  and	  2013).	  
                        3	  
     Complex	   production	   technologies	   with	   sophisticated	   routines	   such	   as	   medical	   care	   require	   strong	  
management	   to	   be	   efficient	   and	   productive.	   	   Bloom	   et	   al.	   (2014)	   provide	   evidence	   that	   better	   management	  
increases	  public	  hospital	  productivity.

                                                            There	   is	   substantial	   evidence	   of	   organizational	   inertia	   in	   medical	   care	   as	   indicated	   by	   the	  
remarkably	  low	  level	  of	  compliance	  with	  Clinical	  Practice	  Guidelines	  (CPGs)	  worldwide	  (Figure	  1).	  
CPGs	  define	  medical	  care	  production	  possibility	  frontiers	  in	  that	  they	  prescribe	  the	  clinical	  content	  
of	   care	   that	   maximizes	   the	   likelihood	   of	   successful	   health	   outcomes	   based	   on	   medical	   science,	  
clinical	  trials,	  and	  practitioner	  consensus.	  Local	  CPGs	  are	  regularly	  updated	  and	  serve	  as	  the	  basis	  
of	   training	   in	   medical	   schools	   and	   practitioner	   refresher	   courses.	  While	   the	   lack	   of	   compliance	   with	  
CPGs	   may	   in	   part	   reflect	   a	   lack	   of	   knowledge,	   evidence	   shows	   that	   practitioners	   often	   provide	   a	  
standard	   of	   care	   well	   below	   their	   level	   of	   knowledge	   of	   CPGs.4	   In	   a	   systematic	   review	   of	   the	  
literature	   on	   reasons	   for	   non-­‐compliance	   of	   CPGs,	   Cabana	   et	   al.	   (1999)	   report	   that	   resistance	   to	  
changing	   existing	   practice	   patterns	   is	   one	   of	   the	   most	   important	   barriers	   to	   CPG	   adherence.	   For	  
example,	  Grol	  and	  Grimshaw	  (2003)	  surveyed	  nurses	  and	  doctors	  in	  the	  UK	  about	  the	  adoption	  of	  
new	   hand	   hygiene	   guidelines.	   Forty-­‐nine	   percent	   responded	   that	   resistance	   to	   changing	   old	  
routines	  was	  an	  obstacle	  to	  complying	  with	  new	  guidelines.5	  	  

                                                            Changing	   deep-­‐rooted	   habits	   is	   hard	   and	   even	   small	   costs	   of	   adjustment	   may	   inhibit	  
changes	   in	   favor	   of	   maintaining	   the	   status	   quo,	   (DellaVigna	   2009;	   Thaler	   and	   Sunstein	   2009).6	   In	  
these	   circumstances,	   temporary	   incentives	   may	   speed	   adoption	   by	   helping	   to	   compensate	  
providers	   for	   the	   initial	   fixed	   costs	   of	   changing	   their	   practice	   pattern	   routines.	   This	   amounts	   to	  
paying	   providers	   a	   time-­‐limited	   per	   unit	   incentive	   for	   the	   provision	   of	   a	   component	   of	   the	   CPGs	   for	  
a	  specific	  condition.7	  	  

                                                            The	   use	   of	   temporary	   incentives	   to	   overcome	   organizational	   inertia	   in	   firms	   is	   similar	   in	  
spirit	  to	  the	  use	  of	  temporary	  incentives	  to	  change	  individual	  and	  consumer	  behavior.	  Firms	  often	  
use	  temporary	  price	  discounts,	  such	  as	  sales	  and	  coupons,	  to	  market	  their	  products	  (Blattberg	  and	  
Neslin	  1990;	  Kirmani	  and	  Rao	  2000;	  and	  Dupas	  2014).	  Discounts	  encourage	  individuals	  to	  purchase	  
goods	  that	  they	  are	  not	  in	  the	  habit	  of	  buying	  which	  in	  turn	  allow	  them	  to	  update	  their	  beliefs	  about	  
the	   product’s	   benefits.	   	   Similarly,	   temporary	   incentives	   have	   been	   used	   to	   try	   to	   help	   individuals

       5	   For	   more	   evidence	   of	   organizational	   inertia	   serving	   as	   a	   barrier	   to	   CPG	   compliance	   see	   Grol	   (1990);

       6	  We	  use	  a	  different	  definition	  of	  habits	  than	  the	  behavioral	  economics	  literature	  where	  habits	  are	  based	  

on	   the	   addiction	   of	   models	   of	   Becker	   and	   Murphy	   (1988).	   Instead,	   we	   rely	   on	   the	   notions	   of	   fast	   and	   slow	  
thinking	  discussed	  in	  Kahneman	  (2012)	  where	  tasks	  performed	  based	  on	  fast	  thinking	  become	  habits.	  
       7	  Paying	  an	  upfront	  lump	  sum	  amount	  is	  another	  option.	  However,	  it	  may	  be	  harder	  to	  ensure	  and	  verify	  

the	  actual	  change	  in	  practice	  patterns.	  By	  paying	  based	  on	  actual	  performance	  the	  incentives	  also	  include	  a	  
commitment	  device	  for	  compliance.

have	  been	  used	  to	  stimulate	  long-­‐term	  savings	  in	  the	  form	  of	  initially	  high	  interest	  rates	  and	  price-­‐
linked	  savings	  or	  lotteries	  (Gertler	  et	  al.	  2015,	  and	  Schaner	  2015).	  	  To	  our	  knowledge,	  our	  study	  is	  
the	  first	  to	  use	  a	  field	  experiment	  to	  examine	  the	  effects	  of	  temporary	  incentives	  on	  long-­‐run	  firm	  
performance.	  

                                             We	  test	  the	  effects	  of	  temporary	  incentives	  paid	  to	  clinics	  for	  early	  initiation	  of	  prenatal	  care	  
using	   a	   field	   experiment	   conducted	   with	   Plan	   Nacer,	   an	   Argentine	   government	   program	   that	  
provides	   health	   insurance	   to	   otherwise	   uninsured	   pregnant	   women	   and	   children.9	   Prenatal	   care	   by	  
skilled	   health	   professionals	   beginning	   in	   the	   first	   trimester	   of	   pregnancy	   is	   essential	   for	   good	  
maternal	   and	   newborn	   health	   outcomes,	   and	   is	   part	   of	   standard	   medical	   training	   throughout	   the	  
world	   (WHO	   2006).	   Through	   early	   initiation	   of	   care,	   providers	   are	   able	   to	   detect	   and	   correct	  
important	   health	   conditions	   such	   as	   infections	   or	   anemia	   before	   they	   jeopardize	   maternal	   or	  
newborn	  outcomes	  as	  well	  as	  advise	  mothers	  on	  proper	  prenatal	  nutrition	  and	  prevention	  activities	  
(Schwarcz	  et	  al.	  2001;	  Carroli	  et	  al.	  2001a	  and	  2001b;	  Campbell	  and	  Graham	  2006).	  Despite	  these	  
recommendations	   and	   the	   scientific	   evidence,	   take-­‐up	   of	   early	   initiation	   of	   prenatal	   care	   remains

which	  treatment	  clinics	  were	  paid	  a	  200%	  premium	  for	  early	  initiation	  of	  prenatal	  care,	  i.e.	  before	  
week	   13.	   	   We	   find	   that	   the	   rate	   of	   early	   initiation	   of	   prenatal	   care	   was	   34%	   higher	   in	   the	   treatment	  
group	  than	  in	  the	  control	  group	  (0.42	  versus	  0.31)	  while	  the	  incentives	  were	  being	  paid,	  and	  that	  
the	   higher	   levels	   of	   early	   initiation	   of	   prenatal	   care	   in	   the	   treatment	   group	   persisted	   at	   least	   15	  
months	   and	   likely	   more	   than	   24	   months	   after	   the	   incentives	   ended.	   We	   document	   that	   clinics	  
changed	  their	  routines	  by	  developing	  strategies	  to	  identify	  likely	  pregnant	  women	  and	  expanding	  
the	   role	   of	   community	   health	   workers	   to	   find	   pregnant	   women	   and	   encourage	   them	   to	   start	   care	  
early,	   and	   that	   these	   changes	   in	   routines	   also	   persisted	   at	   least	   15	   months	   after	   the	   incentives	  
ended.	  Despite	  the	  large	  effect	  of	  the	  incentives	  on	  early	  initiation	  of	  care,	  we	  find	  no	  evidence	  of	  an

                                             Our	  results	  may	  explain	  the	  mechanism	  behind	  recent	  evidence	  that	  permanent	  performance	  
incentives	   do	   indeed	   improve	   both	   quality	   and	   quantity	   of	   care.10	   The	   standard	   neoclassical	  
explanation	   is	   that	   providers	   are	   reallocating	   their	   effort	   across	   services	   in	   response	   to	   the	  
increased	   profit	   opportunities.11	   However,	   previous	   studies	   have	   been	   unable	   to	   distinguish	  
between	   this	   mechanism	   and	   organizational	   inertia.	   One	   way	   to	   distinguish	   between	   the	   two	  
mechanisms	  is	  to	  observe	  what	  happens	  when	  incentives	  are	  removed.	  While	  the	  incentives	  are	  in	  
play	  both	  models	  predict	  a	  positive	  response.	  However,	  once	  the	  incentives	  are	  removed,	  practice	  
patterns	  should	  revert	  to	  prior	  levels	  in	  the	  standard	  models	  but	  continue	  at	  the	  higher	  levels	  under	  
organizational	  inertia.	  	  

                                             Understanding	   the	   mechanism	   by	   which	   financial	   incentives	   work	   is	   not	   only	   scientifically	  
interesting,	  but	  also	  policy	  relevant.	  If	  temporary	  financial	  incentives	  are	  able	  to	  induce	  providers	  
to	   adopt	   permanent	   changes	   to	   their	   clinical	   practice	   patterns,	   then	   temporary	   incentives	   can	  
achieve	   a	   boost	   in	   performance	   at	   a	   substantially	   cheaper	   cost	   than	   permanent	   incentives.	   Our	  
results	  suggest	  that	  the	  mechanism	  behind	  positive	  provider	  responses	  to	  price	  increases	  is	  more	  
related	   to	   adjustment	   costs	   than	   to	   responding	   to	   higher	   profit	   margins.	   In	   this	   case,	   long-­‐term	  
increases	  in	  productivity	  can	  be	  achieved	  more	  cheaply	  than	  through	  a	  permanent	  increase	  in	  fees.	  	  	  


2 CONCEPTUAL	  FRAMEWORK	  
We	  develop	  a	  stylized	  model	  of	  clinical	  practice	  patterns	  where	  clinics	  incur	  a	  fixed	  cost	  to	  change	  
clinical	   practice	   routines.	   We	   assume	   that	   patients	   are	   identical,	   that	   clinics	   provide	   the	   same	  
services	  to	  all	  patients,	  and	  that	  demand	  is	  exogenously	  determined.	  	  	  

                                                            Objective	   Function:	   Clinics	   have	   a	   pay-­‐off	   function	   𝑅 = 𝜋+∝ 𝐻𝑁,	   where	   𝜋	   is	   profits,	   H	   is	  
health	   of	   the	   representative	   patient,	   N	   is	   the	   number	   of	   patients,	   and	   ∝  ∈ 0,1 	   is	   the	   provider’s	  
intrinsic	  value	  of	  a	  unit	  of	  patient	  health.	   12	  As	  ∝	  rises	  the	  clinic	  is	  willing	  to	  sacrifice	  more	  income	  
for	  patient	  health.	  When	  ∝  takes	  on	  value	  0,	  the	  clinic	  is	  purely	  extrinsically	  motivated,	  and	  when	  ∝
  is	   1	   the	   clinic	   is	   purely	   intrinsically	   motivated.	   While	   we	   allow	   for	   both	   extrinsic	   and	   intrinsic	  
motivation	  in	  the	  model,	  all	  of	  the	  results	  follow	  even	  with	  pure	  extrinsic	  motivation.	  Allowing	  for

intrinsic	   motivation	   does	   not	   change	   the	   direction	   of	   the	   predictions	   just	   the	   magnitude.	   Moreover,

both	   services,	   then	   it	   is	   operating	   at	   the	   production	   possibilities	   frontier.	   The	   health	   production	  
function	   for	   the	   representative	   patient	   is	   𝐻 = 𝜆! 𝑆! + 𝜆! 𝑆! + 𝜀,	   where	   𝜀	   is	   a	   mean	   zero	   random	  
shock.

and	   𝑆! 	   is	   an	   additional	   service	   that	   the	   clinic	   could	   choose	   to	   add	   to	   its	   practice	   routine.	   If	   the	   clinic	  
wants	   to	   integrate	   the	   provision	   of	  𝑆! 	   into	   its	  practice	   pattern	   routine	   then	   it	   must	   incur	   an	   upfront	  
fixed	   cost	   F.	   The	   fixed	   cost	   includes	   the	   cost	   of	   retooling	   to	   be	   able	   to	   provide	   𝑆! ,	   the	   cost	   of	   less	  
reliable	   service	   provision	   while	   the	   new	   routine	   is	   being	   learned,	   and	   the	   cost	   of	   overcoming	  
psychological	  resistance	  to	  change.

   13	  Without	  some	  sort	  of	  fixed	  costs	  of	  adjustment,	  both	  intrinsically	  and	  extrinsically	  motivated	  providers	  

would	   still	   operate	   at	   the	   efficient	   frontier.	   Moreover,	   the	   intrinsic	   motivation	   literature	   suggests	   that	  
incentives	   can	   negatively	   impact	   performance.	   The	   psychology	   literature	   in	   particular	   has	   long	   argued	   that	  
performance-­‐contingent	   incentives	   can	   be	   demotivating	   for	   intrinsically	   motivated	   workers.	   For	   example	   see	  
Deci	  (1971);	  Pittman	  and	  Heller	  (1987);	  Deci	  et	  al.	  (1999);	  Deci	  (2001);	  Eccles	  and	  Wigfiel	  (2002);	  Deci	  and	  
Ryan	   (2010).	   Benabou	   and	   Tirole	   (2003)	   embed	   these	   ideas	   in	   principle-­‐agent	   models	   that	   they	   use	   to	  
demonstrate	   the	   mechanisms	   through	   which	   financial	   incentives	   can	   “crowd-­‐out”	   intrinsic	   motivation	   and	  
thereby	  negatively	  affect	  performance.	  Recent	  laboratory	  experimental	  evidence	  on	  performance-­‐contingent	  
contracts	   confirms	   that	   incentives	   in	   the	   presence	   of	   intrinsic	   motivation	   can	   result	   in	   worse	   performance.

services	   might	   lead	   to	   a	   reallocation	   of	   effort	   from	   other	   services	   that	   remain	   unchanged	   leading	   to	  
negative	   cross-­‐price	   effects.	   The	   implicit	   underlying	   model	   in	   these	   papers	   is	   an	   individual

difficult	   to	   verify.	   	   However,	   a	   temporary	   increase	   in	   𝑝! 	   requires	   the	   clinic	   to	   change	   routines	   and	   actually

3 EXPERIMENTAL	  DESIGN	  

The	   field	   experiment	   was	   conducted	   by	   Plan	   Nacer,	   a	   public	   insurance	   program	  that	   began	   in	   2005	  
to	  improve	  access	  to	  quality	  health	  care	  for	  otherwise	  uninsured	  pregnant	  women	  and	  children	  less	  
than	   6	   years	   old	   (Musgrove	   2010;	   Gertler	   et	   al.	   2014).	   Like	   Medicaid	   in	   the	   U.S.	   and	   Seguro	   Popular	  
in	   Mexico,	   the	   national	   Plan	   Nacer	   program	   transfers	   funds	   to	   local	   governments,	   in	   this	   case	  
Provinces,	  who	  are	  then	  responsible	  for	  enrolling	  beneficiaries,	  organizing	  the	  provision	  of	  services,	  
and	  paying	  medical	  care	  providers.	  An	  innovative	  feature	  of	  the	  Argentine	  program	  is	  that	  it	  uses	  
financial	   incentives	   to	   ensure	   that	   beneficiaries	   receive	   high-­‐quality	   care.	   Financing	   from	   the	  
National	  level	  to	  Provinces	  is	  based	  for	  60%	  on	  program	  enrollment	  and	  for	  40%	  on	  performance.	  
Provinces	   then	   use	   those	   funds	   to	   pay	   public	   health	   care	   facilities	   on	   a	   fee-­‐for-­‐service	   basis	   for	  
health	  care	  provided	  to	  program	  beneficiaries.	  The	  national	  government	  determines	  the	  content	  of	  
the	  benefits	  package,	  which	  is	  uniform	  across	  provinces,	  while	  provincial	  governments	  set	  the	  price	  
they	  will	  pay	  to	  providers	  for	  each	  service	  in	  that	  package.	  Health	  facilities	  are	  free	  to	  choose	  how	  
to	   use	   realized	   revenues	   within	   relatively	   broad	   guidelines.	   Some,	   though	   not	   all,	   provinces	   allow	  
health	  facilities	  to	  pay	  bonuses	  to	  personnel.	  

             Plan	   Nacer	  scaled	   up	   by	   first	   recruiting	   and	   training	   clinics	   in	   the	   operations	   of	   its	   program,	  
including	  fee	  structure,	  billing,	  and	  other	  rules.	  The	  program	  regularly	  retrains	  the	  clinics	  to	  keep	  
them	   up	   to	   date	   on	   any	   changes	   and	   reinforce	   areas	   that	   are	   perceived	   to	   be	   weak.	   After	   clinics	   are	  
enrolled,	   clinic	   community	   outreach	   staff	   identify	   eligible	   women	   and	   children	   in	   the	   clinics’	  
catchment	   areas	   in	   order	   to	   enroll	   them	   into	   the	   program.	   Clinic	   outreach	   staff	   also	   regularly	  
contact	  beneficiaries	  to	  encourage	  them	  to	  take	  advantage	  of	  program	  benefits.	  	  

             The	   field	   experiment	   was	   conducted	   with	   primary	   health	   care	   clinics	   in	   the	   Province	   of	  
Misiones,	  one	  of	  the	  poorest	  in	  the	  country	  and	  with	  high	  rates	  of	  maternal	  and	  child	  mortality.	  In	  
Misiones,	  the	  clinic	  is	  allowed	  to	  use	  up	  to	  50%	  of	  revenue	  from	  Plan	  Nacer	  fees	  to	  pay	  bonuses	  to	  
facility	   personnel	   at	   the	   discretion	   of	   the	   facility	   director.	   The	   rollout	   of	   Plan	   Nacer	   in	   Misiones	   was	  




                                                                                     7

knowledgeable	  of	  the	  operation	  of	  Plan	  Nacer	  before	  the	  experiment	  began.	  	  

                                                            The	  experimental	  intervention	  was	  designed	  to	  encourage	  early	  initiation	  of	  prenatal	  care	  
for	   Plan	   Nacer	   beneficiaries,	   thereby	   aligning	   the	   incentives	   in	   Plan	   Nacer	   with	   official	   Argentine	  
clinical	  practice	  guidelines,	  medical	  school	  training,	  and	  international	  scientific	  evidence.	  Before	  the	  
experiment,	   only	   one-­‐third	   of	   Plan	   Nacer	   beneficiaries	   were	   initiating	   care	   in	   the	   first	   trimester	  
(National	   Ministry	   of	   Health,	   2009	   and	   2010).	   The	   experiment	   randomized	   temporary	   financial	  
incentives	  to	  primary	  health	  care	  clinics	  in	  which	  treatment	  clinics	  were	  paid	  a	   200%	  premium	  for	  
early	  initiation	  of	  prenatal	  care,	  i.e.	  before	  week	  13.

intervention.	  Prior	  to	  the	  intervention	  period,	  the	  province	  paid	  facilities	  $40	  ARS	  for	   each	  prenatal	  
visit	  regardless	  of	  when	  it	  occurred	  or	  whether	  it	  was	  the	  first	  or	  a	  subsequent	  visit.15	  During	  the	  
intervention	  period	  the	  fee	  was	  increased	  to	  $120	  ARS	  for	  1st	  visits	  that	  occurred	  before	  week	  13	  
but	  remained	  at	  $40	  ARS	  for	  subsequent	  visits.	  After	  that,	  the	  intervention	  period	  fees	  reverted	  to	  
the	  original	  payment	  of	  $40	  ARS	  for	  all	  visits.	  The	  modification	  amounted	  to	  a	  3-­‐fold	  increase	  in	  the	  
fee	  for	  1st	  visits	  before	  week	  13.	  The	  modified	  fee	  structure	  was	  implemented	  for	  8	  months	  -­‐	  from	  
May	  2010	  to	  December	  2010.	  Facilities	  selected	  to	  receive	  the	  modified	  fee	  structure	  were	  invited	  
to	  participate	  and	  notified	  of	  the	  time-­‐limited	  implementation	  on	  April	  14,	  2010.	  Facility	  directors

4 DATA	  

The	   Province	   of	   Misiones	   maintains	   a	   well-­‐developed	   and	   long-­‐established	   automated	   medical	  
record	   information	   system	   managed	   by	   the	   provincial	   authorities.	   Personnel	   at	   public	   primary	  
health	  clinics	  and	  hospitals	  digitize	  a	  record	  of	  each	  service	  provided	  to	  each	  patient.	  The	  data	  are	  
of	  unusually	  high	  quality	  in	  that	  key	  outcomes	  such	  as	  dates	  of	  visits,	  services	  delivered,	  and	  birth	  
weight	   are	   recorded	   at	   the	   time	   of	   care	   by	   the	   provider;	   therefore	   we	   do	   not	   need	   to	   rely	   on	  
maternal	   recall	   of	   these	   variables	   collected	   in	   surveys	   long	   after	   the	   visit.	   The	   data	   used	   in	   the	  
analysis	  are	  extracted	  from	  these	  clinic	  records	  and	  contain	  information	  on	  the	  universe	  of	  patients	  
for	   the	   36	   clinics	   in	   the	   study.	   The	   records	   also	   include	   the	   individual’s	   national	   identity	   number,	  
which	   is	   used	   to	   link	   the	   individual	   clinic	   medical	   records	   from	   primary	   health	   facilities	   with	   the	  
registry	   of	   health	   insurance	   coverage,	   the	   registry	   of	   Plan	   Nacer	   beneficiaries,	   and	   hospital	   medical	  
records.	  In	  all,	  97%	  of	  the	  primary	  clinic	  medical	  records	  were	  merged	  with	  the	  data	  on	  insurance	  
status	   and	   program	   beneficiary	   status.	   In	   addition,	   75%	   of	   these	   were	   successfully	   merged	   with	  
medical	   records	   data	   from	   hospitals.	   Therefore	   our	   analysis	   is	   able	   to	   evaluate	   the	   impact	   of	   the	  
intervention	   for	   those	   women	   who	   initiated	   their	   prenatal	   care	   in	   one	   of	   the	   primary	   care	   clinics	   of	  
the	  sample.	  

          4.1              ANALYSIS	  SAMPLE	  

             Figure	  2	  depicts	  the	  timeline	  of	  the	  study	  and	  the	  availability	  of	  data	  divided	  into	  4	  different	  
sub-­‐periods:	   (i)	   a	   16-­‐months	   pre-­‐intervention	   period	   from	   January	   2009	   to	   April	   2010,	   (ii)	   an	   8-­‐
month	  intervention	  period	  from	  May	  2010	  to	  December	  2010,	  (iii)	  a	  15-­‐month	  “post-­‐intervention	  
period	  I”	  from	  January	  2011	  to	  March	  2012	  and	  (iv)	  a	  9-­‐month	  “post-­‐intervention	  period	  II”	  from	  
April	  2012	  to	  December	  2012.	  	  

             Prenatal	   care	   data	   was	   consistently	   collected	   for	   the	   first	   3	   periods	   from	   January	   2009	  
through	  March	  2012.	  Starting	  in	  April	  2012,	  however,	  Misiones	  adopted	  a	  new	  information	  system	  
and	   as	   a	   result	   data	   from	   post-­‐intervention	   period	   II	   cannot	   easily	   be	   compared	   to	   data	   from	   the	  
earlier	   periods.	   In	   particular,	   the	   new	   system	   changed	   the	   codes	   used	   to	   classify	   the	   reason	   for	  
visits	  in	  order	  to	  facilitate	  billing.	  If	  in	  the	  first	  visit	  the	  attending	  physician	  requested	  an	  ultrasound	  
to	  confirm	  a	  pregnancy,	  this	  first	  visit	  was	  labeled	  as	  a	  “care	  visit”	  while	  the	  subsequent	  (second)	  
visit,	   was	   labeled	   as	   the	   first	   prenatal	   visit,	   if	   indeed	   the	   ultrasound	   confirmed	   the	   pregnancy.	   On	  
average,	   this	   would	   led	   to	   a	   reduction	   in	   the	   share	   of	   women	   who	   had	   a	   visit	   labeled	   as	   “first	  
prenatal	   visit”	   before	   week	   13	   and	   an	   increase	   in	   the	   weeks	   pregnant	  at	   the	   time	   of	  this	  visit.	   If	   the	  
new	   coding	   system	   affected	   the	   treatment	   and	   control	   groups	   in	   the	   same	   way,	   the	   differences	  

                                                                                       9	                                                                                        	  
	  
	  


between	   the	   treatment	   and	   control	   groups	   would	   still	   capture	   the	   impact	   of	   the	   incentives,	   albeit	  
possibly	   with	   some	   measurement	   error.	   Therefore,	   we	   analyze	   the	   data	   from	   post-­‐intervention	  
period	  II	  separately,	  and	  interpret	  the	  results	  with	  caution.	  	  

                  The	  analysis	  sample	  includes	  pregnant	  women	  who	  were	  beneficiaries	  of	  Plan	  Nacer	  at	  the	  
time	  of	  first	  prenatal	  visit.	   16	  While	  information	  on	  prenatal	  care	  utilization	  is	  available	  for	  the	  full	  
sample	  period,	  information	  related	  to	  birth	  outcomes	  is	  only	  available	  for	  women	  who	  gave	  birth	  in	  
public	  hospital	  through	  2011,	  i.e.	  women	  that	  became	  pregnant	  before	  May	  2011.	  

               4.2                   MEASUREMENT	  OF	  WEEKS	  PREGNANT	  AT	  1ST	  PRENATAL	  VISIT	  

               We	  construct	  the	  number	  of	  weeks	  of	  pregnancy	  at	  the	  time	  of	  the	  first	  prenatal	  visit	  as	  the	  
difference	   between	   the	   date	   of	   the	   first	   visit	   and	   the	   last	   menstrual	   date	   (LMD).	   The	   LMD	   is	  
routinely	  collected	  at	  the	  time	  of	  the	  visit	  to	  calculate	  the	  estimated	  date	  of	  delivery	  (EDD)	  and	  both	  
are	  routinely	  recorded	  in	  the	  patient’s	  medical	  record	  at	  the	  clinic.17	  

                  One	  potential	  problem	  is	  that	  medical	  personnel	  in	  treatment	  facilities	  might	  misreport	  the	  
date	  of	  late	  first	  visit	  as	  occurring	  before	  week	  13	  so	  that	  they	  could	  bill	  to	  the	  program.	  We	  think	  
this	  is	  unlikely	  for	  the	  following	  reasons.	  First,	  the	  week	  of	  visit	  is	  constructed	  from	  the	  date	  of	  the	  
first	  prenatal	  visit	  and	  the	  LMD,	  both	  of	  which	  along	  with	  the	  EDD	  are	  recorded	  in	  real	  time	  in	  the	  
medical	   record.	   In	   order	   to	   falsely	   report	   that	   a	   first	   visit	   occurred	   in	   the	   first	   12	   weeks,	   the	  
provider	  would	  have	  to	  alter	  the	  date	  of	  the	  first	  visit	  relative	  to	  either	  the	  LMD	  or	  the	  EDD	  in	  the	  
medical	   record.	   This	   would	   require	   some	   effort	   if	   done	   in	   real	   time	   and	   would	   be	   noticeable	   by	  
auditors	   if	   altered	   ex	   post.	   Second,	   Plan	   Nacer	   uses	   external	   auditors	   to	   verify	   the	   accuracy	   of	   clinic	  
billing.	   The	   auditors	   compare	   the	   detailed	   clinical	   records	   to	   the	   billing	   requests	   to	   find	  
inconsistencies	   and	   the	   latter	   can	   lead	   to	   substantial	   financial	   penalties	   for	   the	   provinces.	   Finally,	  
clinical	  records	  are	  legal	  documents	  in	  Argentina	  and	  practitioners	  could	  lose	  their	  medical	  license	  
if	  caught	  systematically	  misreporting	  for	  financial	  gain.	  	  

                  To	  corroborate	  our	  belief	  that	  false	  reporting	  in	  the	  clinic	  records	  is	  unlikely,	  we	  empirically	  
test	   whether	   there	   is	   any	   evidence	   of	   systematic	   misreporting	   using	   data	   from	   an	   alternative	  
source.	   Specifically,	   we	   use	   gestational	   age	   at	   birth	   measured	   by	   physical	   examination	   obtained	  

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
                        16	   We	   excluded	   non-­‐beneficiaries	   because	   most	   of	   them	   have	   private	   health	   insurance	   and	   as	   such	   are	  

likely	  to	  receive	  some	  of	  care	  and	  deliver	  at	  private	  facilities.	  Since	  we	  do	  not	  have	  data	  from	  private	  facilities,	  
the	  outcomes	  of	  most	  of	  these	  observations	  are	  censored.	  
       17	  For	  10%	  of	  the	  sample	  LDM	  was	  not	  recorded.	  For	  those	  cases,	  we	  use	  the	  EDD	  to	  recover	  the	  LMD.	  	  




                                                                                                                       10	                                                                                                                         	  
	  
	  


from	   hospital	   records	   to	   construct	   a	   second	   estimate	   of	   the	   LMD	   and	   weeks	   pregnant	   at	   the	   time	   of	  
the	   first	   prenatal	   visit.	   The	   hospital	   personnel	   that	   attend	   the	   birth	   do	   not	   have	   any	   incentive	   to

                                                            Table	  3	  reports	  the	  descriptive	  statistics	  for	  the	  key	  outcomes	  of	  interest	  and	  demographic	  
characteristics	   at	   baseline,	   i.e.	   in	   the	   16-­‐month	   pre-­‐intervention	   period	   (Jan	   2009	   –	   April	   2010).	  
Outcomes	   are	   balanced	   at	   baseline	   in	   that	   there	   are	   no	   statistically	   significant	   differences	   in	   the	  
means	   of	   variables	   between	   the	   treatment	   and	   control	   groups.	   On	   average	   women	   had	   their	   first	  
prenatal	   visit	   about	   17.5	   weeks	   into	   their	   pregnancy	   with	   about	   one-­‐third	   of	   women	   having	   that	  
visit	  before	  week	  13.	  Women	  completed	  about	  4.7	  prenatal	  visits	  over	  the	  course	  of	  their	  pregnancy	  
and	   more	   than	   80%	   of	   them	   received	   a	   tetanus	   vaccine.	   Newborns	   weighed	   approximately	   3300	  
grams	   on	   average,	   while	   about	   6%	   of	   them	   were	   born	   with	   low	   birth	   weight	   (i.e.	   less	   than	   2500	  
grams),	  and	  slightly	  more	  than	  9%	  of	  births	  were	  born	  prematurely.	  


5 IDENTIFICATION	  AND	  ESTIMATION	  
We	   estimate	   both	   the	   intent-­‐to-­‐treat	   (ITT)	   and	   local	   average	   treatment	   (LATE)	   effects	   of	   the	  
incentives	   on	   outcomes.	   The	   ITT	   is	   the	   effect	   of	   assigning	   a	   clinic	   to	   treatment	   on	   outcomes,	  
regardless	  of	  compliance.	  It	  compares	  the	  mean	  outcome	  of	  the	  group	  assigned	  to	  treatment	  to	  the	  
mean	   outcome	   of	   the	   group	   assigned	   to	   control	   and	   is	   estimated	   by	   regressing	   the	   outcome	   against	  
an	   indicator	   of	   whether	   the	   clinic	   was	   assigned	   to	   treatment.	   The	   LATE	   is	   the	   effect	   of	   a	   clinic	  
actually	  receiving	  the	  incentives	  and	  is	  estimated	  regressing	  the	  outcome	  against	  whether	  the	  clinic	  
was	   actually	   treated,	   using	   the	   clinic’s	   randomized	   assignment	   status	   as	   an	   instrumental	   variable	  
for	  actual	  treatment	  (Imbens	  and	  Angrist	  1994).	  In	  both	  cases,	  the	  treatment	  effect	  is	  identified	  off

             Our	  sample	  is	  clustered	  within	  36	  health	  clinics	  since	  the	  random	  assignment	  of	  treatment	  
occurred	  at	  the	  clinic	  level.	   As	   such,	   there	   may	   be	  intra-­‐cluster	  correlation	  that	  must	  be	  considered	  
for	   statistical	   inference.	   Standard	   methods	   of	   correcting	   standard	   errors	   rely	   on	   large	   sample	  
theory	  both	  in	  the	  number	  of	  observations	  and	  in	  the	  number	  of	  clusters.	  Given	  the	  small	  number	  of	  
clusters	  in	  our	  sample,	  we	  instead	  use	  statistical	  inference	  methods	  that	  are	  robust	  to	  randomized	  
assignment	  of	  treatment	  among	  a	  small	  number	  of	  clusters.	  Specifically,	  we	  use	  the	  Wild	  bootstrap	  
method	   to	   generate	   p-­‐values	   for	   hypothesis	   testing	   in	   ITT	   models	   (Cameron	   et	   al.	   2008)	   and	   an	  
analogous	   method	   for	   hypothesis	   testing	   in	   the	   LATE	   models	   (Gelbach	   et	   al.	   2009).	   	   Our	   Wild	  
bootstrap	  procedure	  assigns	  symmetric	  weights	  and	  equal	  probability	  after	  re-­‐sampling	  residuals,

6 TIMING	  OF	  FIRST	  PRENATAL	  VISIT	  

In	   this	   section	   we	   report	   the	   results	   of	   analyses	   of	   the	   effects	   of	   the	   temporary	   incentives	   on	   the	  
timing	  of	  the	  first	  prenatal	  visit	  and	  mechanisms	  by	  which	  clinics	  achieved	  those	  results.	  

          6.1             DENSITIES	  	  

             Figure	  3	  compares	  the	  densities	  of	  weeks	  pregnant	  at	  the	  time	  of	  the	  first	  prenatal	  visits	  for	  
the	  clinics	  assigned	  to	  the	  treatment	  and	  control	  groups.	  Panel	  A	  shows	  that	  there	  is	  no	  difference	  
between	  the	  densities	  of	  the	  treatment	  and	  control	  groups	  in	  the	  pre-­‐intervention	  period.	  Panel	  B	  
shows	   that	   the	   treatment	   group	   density	   is	   to	   the	   left	   of	   the	   control	   group	   density	   during	   the	  
intervention	  period.	  Finally,	  Panel	  C	  and	  D	  show	  that	  the	  treatment	  group	  density	  is	  placed	  to	  the	  
left	   of	   the	   control	   group	   density	   during	   post-­‐intervention	   periods	   I	   and	   II.	   	   Kolmogorov-­‐Smirnov	  
tests	   for	   equality	   of	   the	   distributions	   cannot	   be	   rejected	   for	   the	   pre-­‐intervention	   analysis,	   but	   are	  
rejected	  for	  the	  intervention	  and	  both	  post-­‐intervention	  periods	  with	  p-­‐values	  of	  0.031,	  0.004,	  and	  
0.009	  respectively.	  These	  results	  imply	  that	  the	  temporary	  incentives	  led	  to	  earlier	  initiation	  of	  care	  
in	   the	   treatment	   group	   compared	   to	   the	   control	   group	   in	   the	   intervention	   period	   and	   that	   these	  
higher	  levels	  of	  care	  persisted	  for	  at	  least	  15	  months	  and	  likely	  for	  24	  months	  and	  more	  after	  the	  
higher	  fees	  were	  removed.	  

          6.2             SHORT	  RUN	  EFFECTS	  

             Table	  4	  reports	  the	  estimates	  of	  the	  effects	  of	  the	  temporary	  fees	  on	  the	  early	  initiation	  of	  
care.	   Panel	   A	   reports	  the	  results	  for	  weeks	  pregnant	  at	   the	   time	   of	   the	   first	   prenatal	   visit	   and	   Panel	  
B	  reports	  the	  results	  for	  whether	  the	  first	  visit	  occurred	  before	  week	  13.	  The	  first	  column	  reports	  
the	  results	  for	  the	  intervention	  period	  and	  the	  second	  and	  third	  columns	  report	  the	  results	  for	  the	  

                                                                                   12	                                                                                    	  
	  
	  


post-­‐intervention	   periods.	   During	   the	   intervention	   period,	   on	   average	   women	   in	   the	   treatment	  
group	   had	   their	   1st	   visit	   about	   1.5	   weeks	   earlier	   in	   their	   pregnancy	   than	   women	   in	   the	   control	  
group.	   The	   share	   of	   women	   in	   the	   treatment	   group	   who	   had	   their	   1st	   visit	   before	   week	   13	   is	   11	  
percentage	  points	  higher	  than	  the	  control	  group;	  approximately	  35%	  higher	  than	  the	  control	  group.	  
Both	  estimates	  are	  significantly	  different	  from	  zero	  at	  conventional	  p-­‐values.	  

                                                6.3                                                                      LONG	  RUN	  EFFECTS	  

                                                            Our	   model	   of	   behavioral	   inertia	   provided	   clear	   predictions	   about	   provider	   behavior	   once	  
temporary	   incentives	   disappear:	   i.e.	   if	   the	   fee	   increase	   is	   enough	   to	   overcome	   the	   fixed	   costs	   of	  
adapting	  a	  new	  practice,	  clinics	  should	  maintain	  higher	  levels	  of	  prenatal	  care	  after	  incentives	  are	  
removed.	   Column	   2	   of	   Table	   4	   reports	   estimated	   impact	   of	   the	   temporary	   fee	   increase	   on	   early	  
initiation	  of	  care	  in	  the	  15-­‐month	  period	  after	  the	  fees	  were	  removed.	  	  On	  average,	  women	  in	  the	  
treatment	  group	  started	  their	  care	  1.6	  weeks	  earlier	  than	  those	  in	  the	  control	  group.	   The	  difference	  
between	   the	   treatment	   and	   control	   groups	   in	   the	   share	   of	   women	   who	   had	   their	   1st	   visit	   before	  
week	   13	   was	   8	   percentage	   points.	   Both	   estimates	   are	   statistically	   different	   from	   zero	   at	  
conventional	   levels.	   Further,	   we	   cannot	   reject	   the	   null	   hypothesis	   that	   the	   impact	   is	   different	   in	   the	  
intervention	   and	   post-­‐intervention	   periods.	   These	   results	   are	   consistent	   with	   the	   hypothesis	   that	  
temporary	   incentives	   help	   overcome	   behavioral	   inertia	   and	   motivate	   long	   run	   changes	   in	  
performance.	  

                                                            While	   there	   is	   no	   significant	   different	   between	   the	   effect	   during	   the	   intervention	   and	   the	  
post-­‐intervention	  periods,	  one	  concern	  may	  be	  that	  the	  effect	  of	  treatment	  slowly	  trended	  towards	  
zero	   after	   the	   incentives	   ended.	   To	   test	   this	   hypothesis,	   we	   plot	   the	   mean	   number	   of	   weeks	  
pregnant	  at	  the	  time	  of	  first	  prenatal	  visit	  for	  treatment	  and	  control	  groups,	  before,	  during	  and	  after	  
the	   intervention	   (Figure	   4).19	   We	   split	   the	   pre-­‐intervention	   period	   into	   two	   sub-­‐periods	   of	   6-­‐
months	   each	   and	   the	   post-­‐intervention	   period	   into	   3	   sub-­‐periods:	   the	   first	   two	   are	   6	   months	   and	  
the	   third	   is	   3	   months.	   The	   treatment	   effect	   is	   the	   difference	   between	   the	   two	   lines.	   While	   the	  
treatment	   and	   control	   groups	   have	   similar	   trends	   before	   the	   intervention,	   the	   treatment	   group	  
appears	   to	   receive	   earlier	   care	   during	   the	   intervention,	   and	   the	   change	   persists	   after	   the	   end	   of	   the	  
intervention.	   Notice	   that	   there	   is	   little	   if	   any	   fall	   off	   over	   the	   post-­‐intervention	   period.	   Rather	   the	  
treatment	   effects	   remain	   fairly	   constant	   over	   the	   15	   -­‐month	   post-­‐intervention	   period	   I.	   Figure	   5	  
depicts	   the	   same	   relationship	   for	   the	   share	   of	   women	   who	   receive	   care	   before	   week	   13	   of	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
                        19	   As	   discussed	   above,	   the	   information	   from	   post-­‐intervention	   period	   II	   (April-­‐December	   2012)	   uses	   a	  

different	  metric	  and	  is	  therefore	  not	  included	  in	  this	  figure.

pregnancy.20	   Again,	   the	   effects	   of	   the	   intervention	   appear	   to	   continue	   at	   a	   steady	   rate	   after	   it	   is	  
discontinued.	  	  

                                                6.4                                                                     LONGER	  RUN	  EFFECTS	  
                                                The	  period	  of	  analysis	  in	  our	  main	  results	  is	  restricted	  to	  January	  of	  2009	  to	  March	  of	  2012.	  
Recall	   that	   starting	   in	   April	   2012,	   the	   visit	   coding	   system	   changed.	   Hence	   starting	   in	   April	   2012	  
what	  is	  reported	  as	  first	  visits	  in	  the	  data	  is	  actually	  a	  mix	  of	  first	  and	  second	  visits.	  As	  a	  result	  the	  
average	  of	  weeks	  pregnant	  at	  first	  visit	  increases	  and	  the	  share	  of	  pregnant	  women	  whose	  first	  visit	  
was	  before	  week	  13	  falls	  relative	  to	  previous	  periods.	  Column	  3	  in	  Table	  4	  shows	  the	  results	  for	  this	  
last	  period.	  The	  mean	  average	  of	  weeks	  pregnant	  at	  the	  time	  of	  the	  first	  visit	  for	  the	  control	  group	  is	  
substantially	  higher	  for	  this	  period	  than	  for	  previous	  periods	  and	  the	  mean	  share	  that	  had	  their	  first	  
visit	   before	   week	   13	   is	   substantially	   lower,	   suggesting	   that	   there	   is	   measurement	   error	   in	   our	   main	  
outcome	   in	   this	   period.	   However,	   this	   difference	   in	   coding	   should	   have	   a	   similar	   effect	   in	   treatment	  
and	   control	   clinics	   given	   the	   randomized	   assignment	   of	   the	   treatment.	   Therefore	   the	   difference	  
between	   treatment	   and	   control	   clinics	   should	   cancel	   out	   the	   measurement	   error	   and	   provide	   us	  
with	  unbiased	  estimates	  of	  the	  impact.	  	  

                                                The	   results	   in	   Table	   4	   show	   a	   statistically	   significant	   reduction	   in	   the	   number	   of	   weeks	  
pregnant	   at	   the	   time	   of	   the	   first	   visit	   and	   a	   statistically	   significant	   increase	   in	   the	   share	   of	   pregnant	  
women	  who	  had	  their	  first	  visit	  before	  week	  13.	  These	  results	  suggest	  that	  improved	  productivity	  
from	  the	  temporary	  fee	  increase	  persisted	  at	  least	  24	  months	  after	  the	  fees	  were	  removed.	  	  	  

                                                6.5                                                                      ROBUSTNESS	  

                                                            We	   implement	   three	   robustness	   checks.	   First,	   the	   main	   sample	   may	   include	   pregnancies	  
that	   start	   in	   one	   period	   and	   end	   in	   another,	   which	   could	   cloud	   the	   effect	   of	   the	   incentives	   on	   timing	  
of	  the	  first	  visit.	  For	  example,	  a	  woman	  who	  is	  6	  months	  pregnant	  and	  has	  not	  had	  a	  prenatal	  visit	  
when	   the	   intervention	   starts	   and	   subsequently	   receives	   her	   first	   prenatal	   checkup	   during	   the	  
intervention,	  would	  be	  counted	  as	  a	  third	  trimester	  first	  visit	  during	  the	  intervention	  period,	  even	  
though	   the	   intervention	   cannot	   affect	   whether	   she	   receives	   prenatal	   care	   before	   week	   13.	   Hence,	   in	  
this	  robustness	  test	  we	  re-­‐estimate	  the	  models	  on	  a	  restricted	  sample	  where	  women	  are	  no	  more	  
than	  one	  month	  pregnant	  in	  the	  first	  month	  of	  the	  period	  and	  no	  less	  than	  3-­‐months	  pregnant	  in	  the	  
last	  month	  of	  the	  period.	  The	  results,	  reported	  in	  Panels	  B	  of	  Appendix	  Tables	  B1	  and	  B2,	  are	  very

                                                            Second,	   even	   though	   there	   were	   no	   statistical	   differences	   in	   baseline	   means,	   it	   is	   possible	  
that	  randomization	  was	  not	  able	  to	  fully	  balance	  the	  treatment	  and	  control	  groups	  on	  unobservable	  
characteristics	  given	  the	  small	  number	  of	  clinics.	  	  In	  order	  to	  test	  for	  this	  possibility,	   we	  estimate	  
the	  models	  using	  difference-­‐in-­‐differences	  with	  clinic	  and	  month	  fixed	  effects.	  The	  results,	  reported	  
in	  Panels	  C	  of	  Appendix	  Tables	  B1	  and	  B2,	  are	  very	  close	  in	  magnitude	  and	  statistical	  significance	  to	  
the	  main	  results	  in	  Table	  4.	  	  

                                                            Finally,	  in	  studies	  involving	  a	  small	  sample	  of	  clusters	  there	  is	  a	  concern	  that	  a	  few	  outliers	  
may	   drive	   the	   average	   effect	   found	   in	   the	   previous	   sections.	   We	   explore	   this	   possibility	   by	  
estimating	  clinic-­‐specific	  treatment	  effects	  whereby	  we	  compare	  each	  treated	  clinic	  individually	  to	  
the	   control	   clinics	   as	   a	   group.	   Appendix	   Figures	   B1	   and	   B2	   plot	   these	   individual	   clinic	   treatment	  
effects	   for	   the	   outcomes	   of	   weeks	   pregnant	   at	   the	   time	   of	   the	   first	   prenatal	   visit	   (B1)	   and	   for	   the	  
probability	  of	  that	  the	  first	  visit	  occurred	  before	  week	  13	  (B2),	  respectively.	  The	  results	  are	  sorted	  
along	   the	   x-­‐axis	   from	   the	   lowest	   to	   the	   highest	   estimated	   effect,	   while	   the	   dashed	   blue	   line	   is	   the	  
intent-­‐to-­‐treat	  effect	  calculated	  by	  pooling	  the	  intervention	  and	  the	  first	  post	  intervention	  period.	  	  
The	   solid	   black	   line	   represents	   a	   zero	   treatment	   effect.	   The	   vertical	   lines	   are	   95%	   confidence	  
intervals	   constructed	   using	   standard	   errors	   obtained	   from	   the	   Wild	   bootstrap	   procedure.	   	   The	  
figures	  show	  that	  the	  hypothesis	  of	  no	  treatment	  effect	  is	  rejected	  for	  11	  out	  of	  17	  clinics	  in	  Figure	  
B1	   and	   12	   out	   of	   17	   clinics	   in	   Figure	   B2.	   In	   addition,	   the	   treatment	   effects	   have	   the	   expected	   sign	   in	  
15	   out	   17	   clinics	   in	   Figure	   B1	   and	   14	   out	   of	   clinics	   in	   Figure	   B2.	   This	   provides	   evidence	   that	   our	  
results	  are	  not	  driven	  by	  a	  few	  large-­‐effect	  clinics.

interviews	   with	   professionals	   in	   a	   sub-­‐sample	   of	   5	   treatment	   clinics	   and	   3	   comparison	   clinics.21	   We	  
find	  that	  treatment	  clinics	  adopted	  new	  practices	  and	  changed	  routines	  in	  order	  to	  increase	  early	  
initiation	   of	   prenatal	   care.	   After	   the	   initial	   invitation	   to	   participate	   in	   the	   pilot,	   all	   5	   interviewed	  
treatment	  clinics	  organized	  a	  team	  meeting	  with	  the	  staff	  in	  order	  to	  discuss	  strategies	  to	  respond	  
to	  the	  new	  incentive	  scheme.	  Various	  treatment	  clinics	  adopted	  different	  strategies,	  but	  all	  of	  them	  
involved	   expanding	   the	   scope	   of	   work	   of	   community	   health	   workers	   to	   identify	   and	   encourage	  
newly	   pregnant	   Plan	   Nacer	   to	   initiate	   their	   prenatal	   care	   early.	   In	   some	   clinics,	   the	   director	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
                        21	   The	   clinics	   interviewed	   are	   located	   in	   Posadas,	   the	   capital	   of	   Misiones	   Province.	   Each	   interview	   took	  

approximately	  45	  minutes.	  The	  interviews	  were	  carried	  out	  in	  May	  2015.

supported	   the	   change	   in	   strategies	   by	   changing	   the	   way	   the	   financial	   incentives	   were	   distributed	  
between	  staff	  members.22	  In	  particular,	  some	  of	  them	  started	  allocating	  the	  incentives	  conditional	  
on	  the	  number	  of	  pregnant	  women	  that	  each	  team	  member	  brought	  to	  the	  clinic	  in	  a	  month.	  	  This	  
allocation	  further	  incentivized	  health	  workers	  to	  test	  new	  practices.	  

                                                            The	   in-­‐depth	   interviews	   uncovered	   several	   innovative	   strategies	   that	   treatment	   clinics	  
developed	  to	  identify	  pregnancies	  early.	  For	  instance,	  health	  workers	  started	  to	  follow	  up	  women	  
who	   used	   birth	   control	   pills.23	   Specifically	   community	   health	   workers	   prioritized	   home	   visits	   to	  
women	  who	  had	  not	  picked	  up	  their	  pills.	  Second,	  health	  workers	  started	  targeting	  women	  at	  high	  
risk	   of	   not	   coming	   in	   for	   an	   early	   checkup.	   According	   to	   the	   interviewed	   doctors,	   mothers	   who	  
already	   have	   children	   are	   less	   likely	   to	   initiate	   their	   prenatal	   visits	   early	   in	   a	   new	   pregnancy.	  
However,	   many	   of	   these	   women	   are	   also	   eligible	   for	   weekly	   free	   milk	   distribution	   for	   their	   older	  
children.	   Health	   workers	   met	   these	   mothers	   at	   the	   time	   of	   the	   milk	   distribution,	   enquired	   about	  
their	   last	   menstruation	   date,	   and	   offered	   an	   instant-­‐read	   pregnancy	   test	   to	   those	   women	   whose	  
menstruation	  was	  overdue.	  Third,	  health	  workers	  identified	  difficulties	  in	  providing	  early	  prenatal	  
care	   to	   adolescents,	   as	   they	   might	   be	   unwilling	   to	   reveal	   a	   pregnancy,	   especially	   to	   their	   parents.	  
Community	   health	   workers	   therefore	   decided	   to	   change	   the	   timing	   of	   home	   visits,	   so	   as	   to	   increase	  
the	   chance	   of	   finding	   adolescents	   by	   themselves.	   In	   one	   of	   the	   interviewed	   clinics,	   the	   work	   flow	  
was	  modified	  so	  as	  to	  ensure	  predictable	  availability	  of	  a	  gynecologist	  on	  certain	  days	  of	  the	  week.	  
This	   in	   turn	   provided	   an	   easy	   way	   for	   community	   health	   workers	   and	   administrative	   staff	   to	  
schedule	   patient	   appointments.	   Other	   clinics	   introduced	   new	   ways	   of	   keeping	   track	   of	   “at	   risk”	  
patients,	  such	  as	  a	  notebook	  that	  kept	  track	  of	  any	  visits	  to	  the	  homes	  of	  women	  that	  were	  at	  risk,	  
or	   a	   map	   that	   identified	   catchment	   areas	   of	   community	   health	   workers	   with	   corresponding	  
(potential)	  pregnancies.	  



	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
                        22	  Up	  to	  2013,	  any	  health	  facility	  participating	  in	  Plan	  Nacer	  in	  Misiones	  was	   able	  to	  use	  up	  to	  10%	  of	  their	  

Plan	  Nacer	  funds	  to	  pay	  incentives	  to	  personnel.	  If	  the	  facility	  achieved	  a	  set	  of	  health	  targets	  measuring	  using	  
performance	   indicators	   (tracers)	   set	   by	   the	   province,	   that	   facility	   was	   able	   to	   use	   up	   to	   50%	   of	   funds	   for	  
monetary	   incentives	   to	   health	   professionals.	   The	   bonuses	   could	   be	   assigned	   to	   any	   person	   working	   at	   the	  
health	   facility,	   including	   the	   health	   workers,	   administrative	   personnel,	   volunteers,	   and	   even	   to	   personnel	  
affiliated	   with	   other	   programs	   as	   long	   as	   they	   were	   not	   absent	   for	   more	   than	   10	   working	   days	   in	   a	   month,	  
they	   did	   not	   participate	   in	   a	   strike	   organized	   by	   the	   union,	   and	   they	   were	   not	   subjected	   to	   a	   disciplinary	  
sanction	   (suspension	   without	   pay	   or	   dismissal).	   In	   all	   cases,	   the	   final	   decision	   regarding	   assignment	   of	  
incentives	  to	  personnel	  was	  the	  prerogative	  of	  the	  clinic	  director.

                  We	   are	   able	   to	   substantiate	   the	   claims	   of	   increased	   outreach	   using	   clinic	   administrative	  
records	   on	   the	   number	   of	   community	   outreach	   activities	   that	   resulted	   in	   actual	   maternal-­‐child	  
service	  at	  the	  clinic.24	  Figure	  6	  displays	  the	  average	  and	  median	  number	  of	  outreach	  activities	  that	  
resulted	   in	   actual	   maternal-­‐child	   services	   for	   the	   pre-­‐intervention,	   intervention,	   and	   post-­‐
intervention	   I	   periods.25	   The	   results	   show	   that	   there	   is	   little	   difference	   in	   outreach	   activities	  
between	  treatment	  and	  control	  clinics	  in	  the	  pre-­‐intervention	  period.	  In	  the	  intervention	  period	  the	  
treatment	   group	   evidenced	   substantially	   more	   activities	   than	   the	   control	   group,	   and	   this	   difference	  
is	  sustained	  through	  the	  post-­‐intervention	  period.	  	  

                  We	   use	   the	   data	   to	   estimate	   the	   differences	   in	   log	   number	   of	   activities	   between	   the	  
treatment	  and	  control	  groups.	  The	  results	  show	  no	  differences	  in	  activities	  in	  the	  pre-­‐intervention	  
period	  and	  positive	  and	  statistically	  significant	  higher	  levels	  of	  activities	  in	  the	  treatment	  clinics	  in	  
the	   intervention	   and	   post-­‐intervention	   I	   periods	   (Table	   5).	   Again,	   we	   cannot	   reject	   that	   the	  
hypothesis	  that	  the	  effects	  are	  different	  in	  the	  intervention	  and	  post-­‐intervention	  periods	  implying	  
that	   the	   increase	   in	   successful	   outreach	   activities	   persisted	   after	   the	   temporary	   incentives	   were	  
removed.	  	  

                6.7                  PSYCHOLOGICAL	  BARRIERS	  

                  In	   the	   previous	   subsection	   we	   documented	   tangible	   costs	   of	   adjustment	   to	   increase	   early	  
initiation	   of	   prenatal	   care.	   An	   additional	   potential	   cost	   of	   adjustment	   is	   psychological	   barriers	   to	  
change.	  One	  way	  to	  overcome	  psychological	  resistance	  is	  to	  make	  the	  guideline	  or	  task	  more	  salient	  
in	   the	   minds	   of	   the	   clinic	   staff.	   26	   The	   issue	   is	   not	   one	   of	   lack	   of	   knowledge	   or	   information	   as	  
initiating	  care	  in	  the	  first	  trimester	  has	  been	  in	  CPGs	  since	  the	  1970s	  and	  has	  been	  a	  long-­‐standing	  
part	  of	  standard	  medical	  education.	  	  Rather	  the	  issue	  is	  the	  importance	  or	  priority	  that	  staff	  place	  
on	  the	  task.	  

                  The	   temporary	   incentives	   might	   have	   increased	   the	   importance	   of	   early	   initiation	   of	   care	  in	  
the	  staff’s	  minds,	  thereby	  making	  it	  a	  higher	  priority	  for	  action.	  The	  higher	  the	  priority	  of	  a	  task,	  the

       25	  The	  medians	  are	  better	  measures	  of	  central	  tendency	  as	  the	  densities	  of	  both	  activities	  are	  asymmetric

       26	   Taylor	   and	   Thompson	   (1982)	   define	   salience	   as,	   “…the	   phenomenon	   that	   when	   one's	   attention	   is	  

differentially	  directed	  to	  one	  portion	  of	  the	  environment	  rather	  than	  to	  others,	  the	  information	  contained	  in	  
that	   portion	   will	   receive	   disproportionate	   weighting	   in	   subsequent	   judgments”.	   See	   Bordalo	   et	   al.	   (2012,	  
2013)	  for	  a	  more	  recent	  discussion	  of	  salience	  and	  choice	  theory.	  See	  De	  Mel	  et	  al.	  (2013),	  and	  Karlan	  et	  al.

less	  likely	  psychological	  barriers	  would	  stand	  in	  the	  way	  of	  adoption.	  Kahneman	  (2012,	  pp	  8)	  states	  
that	   “…frequently	   mentioned	   topics	   populate	   the	   mind…”	   more	   than	   others	   and	   “…people	   tend	   to	  
assess	  the	  relative	  importance	  of	  issues	  by	  the	  ease	  with	  which	  they	  are	  retrieved	  from	  memory”.	  
As	   such,	   salience	   “…is	   enhanced	   by	   mere	   mention	   of	   an	   event”	   (Kahneman	   2012,	   pp	   331).	   If	  
incomplete	   or	   non-­‐adoption	   of	   a	   task	   is	   a	   matter	   of	   salience	   then	   the	   observed	   treatment	   effects	  
may	   be	   explained	   by	   the	   fact	   that	   temporary	   incentives	   help	   to	   overcome	   this	   type	   of	   psychological	  
barrier	  to	  change.	  	  

             While	   we	   do	   not	   have	   information	   on	   the	   salience	   of	   early	   initiation	   of	   care	   during	   or	  
shortly	  after	  the	  experiment,	  we	  explore	  whether	  the	  temporary	  fee	  increase	  made	  early	  initiation	  
of	   care	   more	   important	   in	   the	   minds	   of	   the	   clinic	   staff	   after	   the	   end	   of	   the	   experiment,	   using	   an	  
online	  survey	  administered	  to	  the	  chief	  medical	  officer	  of	  each	  clinic	  about	  the	  absolute	  and	  relative	  
importance	   of	   seven	   different	   prenatal	   care	   procedures	   including	   initiating	   prenatal	   care	   prior	   to	  
week	  13	  of	  pregnancy	  (see	  Appendix	  D).	  

             Figures	   8	   and	   9	   compare	   the	   absolute	   score	  and	   relative	   ranking	   of	   the	   procedures	   in	   terms	  
of	   importance	   for	   prenatal	   care.	   The	   absolute	   scores	   ranges	   from	   0	   to	   5,	   with	   5	   being	   the	   highest	  
while	  the	  relative	  ranking	  sorts	  the	  seven	  practices	  from	  1	  to	  7,	  with	  1	  being	  the	  highest	  ranking.	  
Our	  outcomes	  of	  interest	  are	  the	  absolute	  score	  and	  relative	  ranking	  assigned	  to	  early	  initiation	  of	  
prenatal	  care.	  Figure	  8	  shows	  that	  the	  absolute	  score	  assigned	  to	  early	  prenatal	  care	  is	  on	  average	  
4.8	  in	  the	  treatment	  group	  and	  4.7	  in	  the	  control	  group.	  Figure	  9	  shows	  that	  on	  average	  the	  relative	  
ranking	  for	  this	  practice	  is	  also	  similar	  between	  the	  two	  groups,	  2.0	  for	  the	  treatment	  group	  and	  1.9	  
for	   the	   control	   group.	   Moreover,	   these	   differences	   are	   not	   statistically	   significant	   at	   conventional	  
levels	  (see	  Appendix	  D).	  These	  results	  suggest	  that	  the	  early	  initiation	  of	  prenatal	  care	  is	  of	  similar	  
high	   absolute	   and	   relative	   importance	   and	   that	   temporary	   fees	   did	   not	   have	   a	   lasting	   effect	   on	  
either	  the	  absolute	  nor	  relative	  importance.	  	  

          6.8             ALTERNATIVE	  EXPLANATIONS	  

          One	   alternative	   explanation	   for	   the	   short-­‐term	   treatment	   effects	   is	   that	   the	   incentives	   are	  
causing	  treatment	  clinics	  to	  try	  to	  attract	  pregnant	  women	  who	  otherwise	  would	  have	  used	  other	  
clinics.	   This	   is	   unlikely	   to	   be	   true	   as	   beneficiary	   women	   are	   assigned	   to	   specific	   clinics	   when	  
enrolled	  in	  Plan	  Nacer.	  Moreover,	  the	  number	  of	  patients	  per	  month	  and	  the	  share	  that	  initiate	  care	  
before	  week	  13	  are	  the	  same	  in	  the	  pre-­‐	  and	  post-­‐intervention	  periods	  for	  control	  clinics,	  and	  the	  
average	  monthly	  number	  of	  patients	  is	  also	  the	  same	  in	  the	  pre-­‐	  and	  post-­‐intervention	  periods	  for	  
the	  treatment	  clinics.	  	  


                                                                                   18	                                                                                     	  
	  
	  


          An	  alternative	  explanation	  for	  long-­‐run	  results	  is	  that	  after	  the	  temporary	  incentives	  ended,	  
women	  who	  were	  pregnant	  during	  the	  intervention	  periods	  passed	  the	  message	  of	  the	  importance	  
of	   early	   initiation	   of	   care	   onto	   other	   beneficiary	   women	   who	   became	   pregnant	   during	   the	   post-­‐
intervention	   period.	   Hence,	   the	   persistence	   of	   the	   effect	   of	   the	   incentives	   after	   the	   incentives	   might	  
be	   caused	   by	   an	   informational	   spillover.	   However,	   the	   higher	   amount	   of	   the	   community	   outreach	  
activities	   in	   treatment	   clinics,	   the	   mechanism	   used	   to	   generate	   higher	   early	   initiation	   of	   care,	  
continued	  into	  the	  post-­‐experimental	  period	  at	  the	  same	  level	  as	  in	  the	  intervention	  period.	  Hence,	  
if	  there	  were	  information	  spillovers	  in	  the	  post-­‐intervention	  period,	  then	  one	  would	  expect	  to	  see	  
higher	  treatment	  effects	  in	  the	  post-­‐intervention	  period	  than	  in	  the	  intervention	  period.	  	  

          Finally,	  one	  might	  argue	  that	  the	  clinics	  continued	  the	  new	  routines	  after	  the	  temporary	  fees	  
were	   eliminated	   because	   they	   faced	   a	   large	   fixed	   cost	   of	   reverting	   to	   the	   old	   routines	   and	   not	  
because	   the	   new	   routines	   added	   net	   value.	   However,	   in	   this	   case,	   we	   think	   that	   the	   fixed	   costs	   of	  
reversing	   the	   routines	   were	   small,	   because	   the	   community	   health	   workers	   could	   simply	   have	  
returned	  to	  their	  old	  patterns	  of	  activities.	  	  


7 CROSS-­‐PRICE	  EFFECTS	  
            While	  the	  modified	  fee	  schedule	  was	  designed	  to	  affect	  the	  timing	  of	  the	  first	  prenatal	  visit,	  
we	  might	  expect	  providers	  to	  reduce	  effort	  supplied	  to	  other	  services,	  resulting	  in	  a	  lower	  provision	  
of	   such	   services	   to	   patients.	   We	   test	   for	   this	   by	   estimating	   the	   effect	   of	   the	   incentives	   on	   the	  
probability	   of	   pregnant	   women	   having	   a	   valid	   tetanus	   vaccine,	   and	   the	   number	   of	   prenatal	   visits.	  
The	  results	  presented	  in	  Table	  6	  report	  no	  evidence	  of	  cross-­‐price	  effects,	  positive	  or	  negative,	  in	  
either	   the	   intervention	   period	   or	   in	   post-­‐intervention	   period	   I.	   In	   fact,	   the	   levels	   of	   these	   services	  
appear	  to	  be	  constant	  over	  time.	  While	  the	  concern	  about	  crowding-­‐out	  is	  typically	  for	  a	  context	  of	  
individual	  providers	  facing	  time	  and	  effort	  constraints,	  our	  results	  are	  consistent	  with	  a	  firm	  setting	  
where	  there	  are	  no	  overall	  effort	  or	  time	  constraints.	  


8 BIRTH	  OUTCOMES	  
          Next	   we	   address	   the	   question	   of	   whether	   the	   effect	   of	   the	   incentives	   for	   early	   initiation	   of	  
prenatal	   care	   translated	   into	   improved	   birth	   outcomes	   as	   measured	   by	   birth	   weight,	   low	   birth	  
weight,	  and	  premature	  birth.	  As	  shown	  in	  Figure	  7	  and	  reported	  in	  Table	  7	  we	  find	  no	  effect	  of	  the	  
incentives	  on	  birth	  outcomes	  in	  either	  the	  intervention	  period	  or	  in	  the	  post-­‐intervention	  period.	  	  



                                                                                 19	                                                                                   	  
	  
	  


                                                There	   are	   a	   number	   of	   possible	   reasons	   for	   this.	   First,	   the	   sample	   could	   be	   too	   small	   to	   be	  
able	   to	   detect	   a	   statistically	   significant	   effect	   on	   outcomes.	   However,	   the	   point	   estimates	   are	   very	  
small,	  half	  of	  them	  are	  negative	  and	  they	  are	  of	  similar	  magnitude	  to	  differences	  between	  treatment	  
and	  control	  groups	  in	  the	  pre-­‐intervention	  period.	  	  Second,	  given	  that	  the	  results	  on	  birth	  outcomes	  
are	   obtained	   from	   an	   analysis	   of	   a	   subsample	   of	   beneficiaries	   for	   whom	   we	   were	   able	   to	   merge	  
prenatal	  care	  records	  with	  hospital	  medical	  records,	  it	  is	  possible	  that	  the	  results	  in	  Table	  4	  do	  not	  
hold	  for	  this	  subsample.	  We	  therefore	  replicate	  the	  prenatal	  care	  analysis	  using	  only	  the	  subsample	  
of	   women	   for	   whom	   hospital	   medical	   records	   are	   available.	   Overall,	   we	   obtain	   similar	   results	   to	  
those	   obtained	   with	   the	   full	   sample.27	   Third,	   despite	   the	   medical	   literature	   and	   CPG	  
recommendation,	   it	   is	   possible	   that	   early	   initiation	   of	   care	   matters	   only	   a	   small	   amount	   for	   the	  
general	  population	  of	  pregnant	  women,	  even	  if	  early	  initiation	  of	  care	  matters	   a	  great	  deal	  for	  high-­‐
risk	  patients.	  High	  risk	  patients	  include,	  among	  others,	  smokers,	  substance	  abusers,	  those	  with	  poor	  
medical	  and	  pregnancy	  histories,	  and	  those	  who	  start	  prenatal	  care	  very	  late	  in	  their	  third	  trimester	  
or	  only	  when	  a	  problem	  occurs.	  	  It	  may	  be	  that	  the	  increase	  in	  early	  initiation	  of	  care	  comes	  from	  
primarily	   low-­‐risk	   mothers	   who	   are	   less	   likely	   to	   benefit	   from	   early	   initiation	   of	   care.	   One	   would	  
think	   that	   it	   would	   be	   easier	   to	   persuade	   low-­‐risk	   mothers	   to	   come	   a	   littler	   earlier	   than	   to	   convince	  
high-­‐risk	  mothers	  who	  are	  reluctant	  to	  come	  for	  any	  care	  at	  all.	  	  

                                                            In	  fact,	  this	  is	  consistent	  with	  the	  small	  reduction	  in	  the	  average	  weeks	  pregnant	  at	  the	  time	  
of	  the	  first	  prenatal	  visit.	  	  On	  average,	  women	  in	  the	  treatment	  group	  initiated	  prenatal	  care	  about	  
1.5	   weeks	   earlier	   than	   women	   in	   the	   control	   group.	   Prenatal	   care	   may	   affect	   birth	   outcomes	   by	  
diagnosing	   and	   treating	   illness	   such	   as	   hypertension	   and	   gestational	   diabetes	   as	   well	   as	   trying	   to	  
change	  maternal	  behavior	  through	  promoting	  activities	  such	  as	  good	  nutrition,	  not	  smoking	  and	  not	  
consuming	   alcohol.	   If	   the	   intervention	   had	   induced	   high-­‐risk	   women	   who	   otherwise	   would	   have	  
had	  1st	  visit	  much	  later	  in	  the	  pregnancy,	  then	  the	  incentives	  may	  have	  had	  a	  measurable	  impact	  on	  
birth	  outcomes.	  Hence,	  while	  the	  incentives	  were	  effective	  in	  increasing	  early	  initiation	  of	  care,	  they	  
did	   not	   manage	   to	   sufficiently	   affect	   the	   group	   most	   likely	   to	   benefit.	   The	   solution	   might	   be	   to	  
condition	   incentives	   on	   attending	   high-­‐risk	   women,	   but	   risk	   is	   difficult	   and	   expensive	   to	   identify	  
and	  verify	  and	  therefore	  may	  not	  be	  contractible.

9 DISCUSSION	  

We	   examine	   the	   effects	   of	   temporary	   financial	   incentives	   for	   medical	   care	   providers	   to	   increase	  
early	   initiation	   of	   prenatal	   care	   for	   pregnant	   women	   using	   a	   randomized	   controlled	   trial	   in	  
Argentina.	   The	   intervention	   randomly	   allocates	   a	   three-­‐fold	   increase	   in	   the	   fee	   paid	   to	   health	  
facilities	  for	  each	  initial	  prenatal	  visit	  that	  occurs	  before	  week	  13	  of	  pregnancy.	  This	  premium	  was	  
implemented	   for	   a	   period	   of	   8	   months	   and	   then	   ended.	   Using	   data	   on	   health	   services	   and	   birth	  
outcomes	   from	   medical	   records,	   we	   investigate	   both	   the	   short-­‐term	   effects	   of	   the	   incentive	   and	  
whether	  the	  effects	  persist	  once	  the	  direct	  monetary	  compensation	  disappears.	  	  

             Our	   results	   suggest	   that	   the	   temporary	   incentives	   motivated	   long	   run	   changes	   in	  
performance.	  We	  find	  that	  the	  incentives	  led	  to	  pregnant	  women	  being	  35%	  more	  likely	  to	  initiate	  
prenatal	   care	   before	   week	   13	   and	   that	   the	   higher	   levels	   of	   early	   initiation	   of	   care	   persisted	   for	   at	  
least	   15	   months	   and	   likely	   more	   than	   24	   months	   after	   the	   incentives	   ended.	   These	   results	   are	  
consistent	   with	   a	   model	   of	   providers	   who	   face	   a	   fixed	   cost	   to	   changing	   their	   clinical	   practice	  
routines,	   i.e.	   organizational	   inertia.	   Temporary	   incentives	   induced	   providers	   to	   adopt	   changes	   to	  
their	   clinical	   practice	   patterns	   by	   helping	   them	   to	   overcome	   inertia.	   Once	   they	   adopt	   changes	   to	  
practice	   patterns	   that	   they	   believe	   are	   beneficial	   to	   patients,	   the	   changes	   persist	   even	   after	   the	  
monetary	   incentives	   disappear.	   These	   results	   are	   consistent	   with	   the	   findings	   from	   in-­‐depth	  
interviews	  that	  evidenced	  that	  treatment	  clinics	  adopted	  innovative	  practices	  and	  changed	  routines	  
in	  order	  to	  increase	  early	  initiation	  of	  prenatal	  care.	  

             Our	  study	  adds	  to	  the	  growing	  body	  of	  evidence	  that	  incentives	  are	  effective	  in	  improving	  
provider	  performance.	  	  Our	  results	  also	  have	  a	  number	  of	  important	  policy	  implications.	  First,	  our	  
results	   suggest	   that	   temporary	   incentives	   may	   be	   effective	   in	   motivating	   long-­‐term	   provider	  
performance	   at	   a	   substantially	   lower	   cost	   than	   permanent	   incentives.	   Second,	   while	   we	   find	   that	  
incentives	  are	  able	  to	  motivate	  changes	  in	  clinical	  practice	  patterns,	  we	  did	  not	  find	  improvements	  
in	  health	  outcomes.	  The	  monetary	  incentives	  that	  were	  implemented	  were	  not	  able	  to	  sufficiently	  
reach	  those	  women	  for	  whom	  early	  initiation	  of	  prenatal	  care	  would	  have	  the	  largest	  health	  impact.	  
Therefore,	   incentives	   may	   be	   made	   more	   effective	   by	   defining	   ex-­‐ante	   the	   population	   most	   likely	   to	  
benefit,	  and	  tailoring	  incentives	  towards	  this	  population.	  However,	  tailoring	  incentives	  to	  high	  risk	  
populations	   or	   those	   most	   likely	   to	   benefit	   from	   the	   services	   may	   not	   be	   contractible	   as	   these	  
characteristics	   are	   typically	   not	   observable.	   This	   is	   maybe	   a	   major	   limitation	   of	   using	   incentive	  
contracts	  to	  improve	  health	  outcomes.

APPENDIX	  A:	  TEST	  OF	  MISREPORTING	  WEEKS	  PREGNANT	  AT	  1ST	  PRENATAL	  VISIT	  

One	  concern	  is	  that	  the	  financial	  incentives	  may	  cause	  clinics	  to	  misreport	  the	  week	  of	  pregnancy	  at	  
the	  first	  visit.	  In	  this	  appendix	  we	  report	  the	  results	  of	  test	  for	  this	  behavior.	  Recall	  that	  in	  our	  main	  
analysis	   we	   construct	   the	   week	   of	   pregnancy	   at	   the	   first	   visit	   using	   the	   date	   of	   the	   first	   visit	   and	   the	  
last	   menstrual	   date	   (LMD)	   as	   reported	   by	   the	   women.	   If	   the	   latter	   is	   not	   available	   we	   use	   the	  
estimated	  date	  of	  birth	  (EDD)	  as	  recorded	  by	  the	  physician	  in	  the	  first	  visit.	  The	  EDD	  is	  calculated	  
off	   the	   LMD	   as	   reported	   by	   the	   women	   during	   her	   first	   visit.	   While	   clinic	   medical	   records	   should	  
contain	  both	  dates,	  about	  10%	  of	  records	  are	  missing	  the	  LMD.	  	  

              One	   possible	   way	   of	   misreporting	   the	   week	   of	   pregnancy	   at	   the	   first	   visit	   is	   to	   change	   the	  
LMD	   and	   the	   EDD	   in	   the	   patient’s	   clinical	   medical	   record.	   For	   instance,	   if	   a	   woman	   is	   in	   her	   21st	  
week	   of	   pregnancy	   at	   the	   first	   visit,	   the	   physician	  could	   add	   7	   days	   to	   the	   LMD	   and	   EDD	   so	   that	   the	  
visit	  falls	  into	  the	  20th	  week	  of	  pregnancy.	  Both	  would	  have	  to	  be	  changed	  in	  order	  to	  deceive	  the	  
auditors.	  	  
              To	   test	   for	   this	   possibility	   we	   use	   gestational	   age	   at	   birth	   (GAB)	   in	   weeks	   measured	   by	  
physical	   examination	   at	   the	   time	   of	   birth,	   registered	   in	   the	   hospital	   medical	   record.	   We	   then

elapsed	  from	  first	  visit	  to	  the	  delivery	  date	  based	  on	  EDD.	  While	  EDD	  is	  collected	  by	  the	  clinic	  who	  
has	  an	  incentive	  to	  misreport,	  the	  GAB	  is	  collected	  by	  the	  hospital	  at	  time	  of	  delivery	  where	  there	  is	  
no	  incentive	  to	  misreport.	  
              Figure	   A1	   plots	   the	   number	   of	   weeks	   to	   delivery	   from	   the	   time	   of	   the	   1st	   visit	   based	   on	   GAB	  
(y-­‐axis)	  to	  the	  one	  based	  on	  EDD	  (x-­‐axis).	  If	  there	  is	  no	  difference	  between	  the	  two	  measures,	  then	  
all	  of	  the	  dates	  should	  fall	  on	  the	  45-­‐degree	  blue	  line.	  There	  should	  be	  some	  differences	  as	  EDD	  is	  an	  
estimate	  that	  assumes	  no	  prematurity	  at	  birth,	  and	  there	  could	  be	  data	  entry	  in	  GAB	  and	  EDD	  and	  
recall	  errors	  in	  EDD.	  Figure	  A1	  shows	  that	  almost	  all	  of	  the	  data	  embrace	  the	  blue	  45-­‐degree	  line	  
and	   most	   of	   the	   observations	   off	   the	   line	   are	   situated	   above	   it,	   consistent	   with	   prematurity	  
explaining	  the	  differences.	  
              If	   the	   clinic	   changes	   the	   EDD	   in	   order	   to	   capture	   higher	   payments,	   we	   would	   expect	   greater	  
differences,	   for	   the	   treatment	   group,	   between	   GAB	   and	   EDD	   below	   the	   12-­‐week	   thresholds	   than	  
above	  it	  during	  the	  intervention	  period	  when	  the	  incentives	  are	  in	  force,	  but	  no	  differences	  in	  the	  
pre-­‐intervention	   period.	   In	   order	   to	   test	   this,	   we	   estimate	   the	   following	   difference	   in	   difference

before	   EDD,	   we	   expect	   𝛽	   to	   be	   close	   to	   but	   less	   than	   one.	   Then	   we	   can	   interpret	   the	   other

Notes:	  This	  table	  reports	  ITT	  estimates	  of	  the	  treatment	  effect	  of	  the	  modified	  fee	  schedule	  on	  indicators	  of	  
the	   timing	   of	   the	   1st	   prenatal	   visit.	   The	   LATE	   estimates	   are	   reported	   in	   Table	   4.	   The	   differences	   are	   estimated	  
from	   OLS	   regressions	   of	   the	   dependent	   variable	   on	  an	   indicator	   for	   clinic	   treatment	   random	   assignment.	   The	  
p-­‐values	  are	  for	  2-­‐sided	  hypothesis	  tests	  of	  the	  null	  that	  the	  difference	  is	  equal	  to	  zero.	  We	  present	  both	  the	  p-­‐
value	   computed	   for	   large	   samples	   and	   a	   Wild	   bootstrapped	   p-­‐value	   that	   is	   robust	   in	   samples	   with	   small	  
numbers	   of	   clusters	   (Cameron	   et	   al.	   2008).	   Our	   Wild	   bootstrap	   procedure	   assigns	   symmetric	   weights	   and	  
equal	   probability	   after	   re-­‐sampling	   residuals	   (Davidson	   and	   Flachaire	   2008)	   and	   uses	   999	   replications.	  
Column	   (1)	   reports	   the	   results	   for	   the	   sample	   observed	   in	   an	   8-­‐month	   intervention	   period	   (May	   2010	   –

APPENDIX	  D:	  ONLINE	  SURVEY	  OF	  CLINICS	  
	  
             In	  collaboration	  with	  the	  Provincial	  Management	  Unit	  of	  the	  program	  (UGPS),	  in	  May	  2015	  
we	  conducted	  a	  short	  online	  survey	  (using	  Survey	  Monkey®)	  in	  those	  clinics	  that	  participated	  in	  the	  
pilot.	  The	  survey	  aims	  to	  measure	  the	  absolute	  and	  relative	  importance	  of	  seven	  different	  prenatal	  
care	   procedures	   including	   initiating	   prenatal	   care	   prior	   to	   week	   13	   of	   pregnancy.	   The	   absolute	  
scores	  range	  from	  1	  to	  5,	  with	  5	  being	  the	  highest	  score	  in	  terms	  of	  importance,	  and	  an	  additional	  
option	   of	   zero	   indicating	   that	   the	   procedure	   is	   not	   appropriate	   for	   a	   pregnant	   woman.	   Hence,	   the	  
absolute	   score	   ranges	   from	   0	   to	   5	   points.	   The	   relative	   ranking	   aimed	   to	   sort	   the	   seven	   practices	  
from	  1	  to	  7,	  with	  1	  being	  the	  highest	  ranking.	  	  In	  practice	  however,	  the	  survey	  instrument	  allowed	  
the	  respondent	  to	  repeat	  numbers.	  
             The	   survey	   was	   sent	   out	   to	   by	   email	   to	   clinics	   directors	   (or	   the	   next	   person	   in	   rank).	   We	  
were	   unable	   to	   obtain	   current	   email	   addresses	   for	   8	   out	   of	   the	   36	   clinics.	   Another	   4	   clinics	  
confirmed	   having	   received	   the	   email	   but	   refused	   to	   answer	   it.	   Out	   of	   the	   24	   clinics	   that	   did	   respond	  
to	   the	   survey,	   21	   fully	   completed	   it	   while	   3	   only	   partially	   completed	   it.	   Out	   of	   the	   21	   clinics	   with	  
complete	  responses,	  13	  belong	  to	  the	  treatment	  group	  and	  8	  to	  the	  control	  group.	  Appendix	  Table	  
D1	   shows	   that	   there	   are	   no	   significant	   differences	   in	   baseline	   characteristics	   between	   clinics	   that	  
responded	  to	  the	  survey	  and	  clinics	  that	  did	  not	  respond.	  In	  addition,	  we	  account	  for	  survey	  non-­‐
