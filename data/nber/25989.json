    "abstract": "\n\nDo temporary workers face more employment and earnings risk than direct-hire workers? We link administrative workers\u2019 compensation claims to earnings records to measure the risk posed by workplace injuries, comparing employment and earnings outcomes between temporary and direct-hire workers injured doing the same job. We implement two complementary empirical strategies to account for underlying di\ufb00erences in labor market attachment. Despite evidence that injury severity does not vary between the two sets of workers, temporary workers su\ufb00er larger reductions in employment and more severe earnings losses, persisting at least three years after injury, relative to similar direct-hire workers. The additional earnings losses su\ufb00ered by temporary workers are partially o\ufb00set by workers\u2019 compensation bene\ufb01ts, but the income loss gap is still large even after accounting for these bene\ufb01ts.\n\n",
