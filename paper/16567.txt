ABSTRACT
Do external imbalances increase the risk of financial crises? In this paper, we study the experience
of 14 developed countries over 140 years (1870-2008). We exploit our long-run dataset in a number
of different ways. First, we apply new statistical tools to describe the temporal and spatial patterns
of crises and identify five episodes of global financial instability in the past 140 years. Second, we
study the macroeconomic dynamics before crises and show that credit growth tends to be elevated
and natural interest rates depressed in the run-up to global financial crises. Third, we show that recessions
associated with crises lead to deeper recessions and stronger turnarounds in imbalances than during
normal recessions. Finally, we ask if external imbalances help predict financial crises. Our overall
result is that credit growth emerges as the single best predictor of financial instability, but the correlation
between lending booms and current account imbalances has grown much tighter in recent decades.

Introduction

It is a great irony that crises are orphans right up to their inception, at which point they become
the scions of new economic orthodoxies and a few fortune tellers. In the 2007/08 crisis some have
taken issue with the Federal Reserve and a policy that kept interest rates too low in the wake of the
2001 recession (J. B. Taylor 2007, 2009).1 Also potentially critical flaws in the reigning doctrine
of inflation targeting have been pointed out with reference to its nonessential role for money and
its neglect of distortions and instabilities arising from bank (or nonbank) credit channels (Borio
and White 2003; Goodhart 2007; Borio, 2008; Christiano et al. 2010). Yet an influential school of
thought, popular among policy makers, puts the blame less on short-term interest rates controlled
by central banks, and more on international imbalances (Economic Report of the President 2009).
Among others, Ben Bernanke (2009) and Mervyn King (2010) have linked the crisis to capital
flows from developing into developed economies, mainly in the form of reserve accumulation by
emerging markets. These reverse capital flows, the argument goes, opened up a Pandora’s box of
financial distortions. As foreign savings were predominantly channeled through government (or
central bank) hands into Treasuries, private investors turned elsewhere to look for higher yields,
which contributed to the global mis-pricing of financial risks. In the words of King (2010):
The massive flows of capital from the new entrants into western financial markets
pushed down interest rates and encouraged risk-taking on an extraordinary scale. . . Capital
flows provided the fuel which the developed world’s inadequately designed and regulated financial system then ignited to produce a firestorm that engulfed us all.
An intermediate position stresses that global imbalances and financial crises are the product
of “common causes.” These authors argue that the interaction of domestic and external factors
prepared the ground for the boom that went bust in 2007–2009. Lax monetary policy, low real
interest rates, financial innovation, and credit market distortions created a dangerous cocktail,
but international factors such as exchange rates and other economic policies pursued in emerging markets also played a critical role (Obstfeld and Rogoff 2009; Obstfeld 2010; Ferguson and
Schularick 2010).
1 Also limits to liability and a short-term bonus culture have been cited as a reason for excessive risk taking
(Alessandrini and Haldane 2009; Hume and Sentence 2010). Others have pointed to political incentives for excessive
risk taking as part of a mistaken social policy agenda, see Calomiris (2010).

1

Proposals to limit imbalances feature prominently on the post-crisis policy agenda. With an eye
on limiting financial fragility, Goodhart and Tsomocos (2010) have proposed taxes on capital flows
to keep risky imbalances in check; others have suggested reciprocal capital account restrictions
to deal with excessive reserve accumulation (Gros 2010). And as this paper was completed, the
G20 announced a proposal for a system to monitor and limit current account imbalances with the
support of the IMF. Yet, when it comes to the issue of financial instability, to date there is little
empirical research that sheds light on the role of the global imbalances—as compared to other
factors—in credit boom-bust episodes in advanced economies.2
In this paper we reach back to the economic history of the past 140 years to study the linkage
between the international economy and financial instability. Building on a long-run cross-country
dataset covering 14 advanced countries, we assess the role of external factors in financial crises. Our
broad historical purview is motivated by the fact that disruptive events like economic depressions
and financial crises are “rare events”, at least in developed economies. Thus, sample sizes are
small, and providing a detailed quantitative rendition requires that we expand our dataset across
both time and space. As in recent work by Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), Barro (2009), and Almunia
et al. (2009), the purpose of this paper is to go back to comparative economic history as a way to
more robustly explore the link between financial crises and external imbalances.
Our empirical analysis proceeds in four steps. In the first part, we set the stage by applying
new nonparametric methods to study the temporal and spatial coherence of financial crises across
countries in the past 140 years. To our knowledge, this represents the first detailed attempt at
analyzing these correlation patterns of financial crises in the Western world in the past century.
The goal of this section is to see what, if any, empirical regularities can be detected in the frequency
and distribution of financial crises across countries in the past 140 years. Our results are by
and large negative. While we can identify four big synchronized global crises when a significant
number of countries in our sample experienced financial crises—in 1890, 1907, 1921, 1930/31, and
2007/08—about half of all crises occur in one country only. However, it is striking from the data
that no financial crises happened during the Bretton Woods years of tight financial regulation and
capital controls the the years from WW2 until the mid 1970s.
2 There is a longer and stronger literature examining these factors in emerging markers. See, for example,
Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999).

2

In the second part, we provide descriptive statistical evidence on the behaviour of key economic
and financial variables in the years leading up to national and global financial crises. The aim is
to identify in what sense synchronized crises across many countries (‘global crises’) are different
from national (‘isolated’) crises. Our results indicate that boom and bust dynamics have been
more pronounced in the ‘global’ crises as measured by growth and investment dynamics. Tellingly,
although both credit and money growth are strongly elevated before both types of financial crises,
we find historical evidence that global crises typically occurred in an environment of particularly
depressed natural interest rates. Crises are also typically preceded by somewhat larger current
account deficits relative to the country’s own history—a fact that we exploit later in the paper
when we explore how to improve crisis prediction tools. At this stage of the paper there is in
hand prima facie evidence that both domestic credit and external imbalances could play a role in
financial crises.
In the third part, we focus on the economic effects of financial crises. A key contribution
of this paper is that we differentiate between recessions that are preceded by a financial crises
and ‘normal’ recessions. In other words, we ask whether financial busts lead to meaningfully
different performance compared with ‘normal’ recessions—i.e., not compared with normal times.
We also differentiate between national and global financial crises. For this more detailed analysis
a consistent business cycle dating method was needed for 14 countries over 140 years. We detail
our methodology in the appendix. Our key results are the following: deflationary tendencies are
considerably more pronounced in crisis recessions than in normal business cycle downturns. Crisis
recessions also display a strongly negative impact on loan growth, which slows down considerably
more than in normal recessions. Unlike in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, current
accounts generally show a general tendency to improve in postwar recessions, but even more so in
those associated with a financial crisis.
In the fourth and last empirical part, we ask whether external imbalances help predict the
occurrence of financial instability in advanced economies. More specifically, we add long-run
current account data as an additional ‘early warning signal’ into a crisis prediction framework
developed in Schularick and A. M. Taylor (2009). While we find that credit trends, not external
imbalances remain the best predictor of financial instability, the predictive ability of the model
increases slightly if external factors are added to the regressions. In particular, in the post BrettonWoods era the role of international capital flows (as measured by current account balances) has
3

increased considerably and the interaction of external imbalances and credit growth gains in
importance. We conclude that there is some evidence that in an era of high capital mobility
elastic current accounts add to financial stability risks, but the primary warning indicator is still
credit growth.

Preliminaries

In this section we discuss the new dataset and new methods that we will put to use.

2.1

Our Data

Our dataset covers 14 countries over the years 1870–2008. The countries included are the United
States, Canada, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. At the core of the dataset are yearly
data for outstanding bank loans (domestic bank credit), complemented with a narrow (M1) and
broad (typically M2 or M3) monetary aggregates as well as data on nominal and real output,
inflation and investment. For most variables we could rely on the dataset from Schularick and A.
M. Taylor (2009). We extended this dataset using annual data on current account position and
trade balances from various sources that are documented in the data appendix. With two minor
exceptions (Switzerland before 1921 and Spain in the 1920s), we were able to compile long-run
current account series matching the credit and real economic data series. The main sources for
the current account and trade data were Jones and Obstfeld (1997), A. M. Taylor (2002), the
various volumes compiled by Mitchell (2007a, b, c), as well as the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics (2010). We amended these using national sources wherever necessary and possible. We
are grateful to a number of colleagues who shared their data or directed us to the appropriate
sources.3 Table 1 briefly summarizes our dataset.
With regard to the coding of financial crisis episodes we follow the description in Schularick
and A. M. Taylor (2009), which itself relies heavily on Bordo et al. (2001) as well as Reinhart
and Rogoff (2009) for the pre WWII years. For the post-1960 period detailed crisis histories
can found in the databases compiled by Laeven and Valencia (2008), as well as in the evidence
described by Cecchetti et al. (2009). A table showing the crisis events by country-year can be

Notes: Money denotes broad money. Loans denote total bank loans. The sample runs from 1870 to
2008. War and aftermath periods are excluded (1914–19 and 1939–47), as is the post-WW1 German
hyperinflation episode (1920–25). The 14 countries in the sample are the United States, Canada, Australia,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United

found in the appendix. In line with the previous studies, we define systemic financial crises as
events during which a country’s banking sector experiences bank runs, sharp increases in default
rates accompanied by large losses of capital that result in public intervention, bankruptcy, or the
forced merger of major financial institutions (Laeven and Valencia 2008).

2.2

Our Classification Methods

Financial crises, clinical depression and spam e-mail share common features that require specialized
statistical methods. They can be characterized as binary events (one is in a financial crisis or not,
one is depressed or not, an e-mail is spam or not) whose outcome may be difficult to verify even
ex-post—was it a financial crisis or a simple recession, clinical depression or bipolar disorder, spam
e-mail or a commercial e-mail about a product we own?
In all cases, it is desirable to have a means to predict the binary outcome but here one may
not be concerned as much with a precise probability estimate about the likelihood of an outcome,
as much as taking some action in response to that prediction and its quality. It is perhaps this
last feature that differentiates some of the tools that we employ in this paper from the traditional
discussion of binary dependent variables common in the econometrics literature. Thus some brief
discussion of our techniques is called for.
Crises are events, often observed infrequently, that by nature deviate from the norm in a
sizeable manner. Handling such a problem therefore requires methods that are specially flexible

5

and for this reason the statistical design necessarily relies heavily on nonparametric methods. Let
the state variable St ∈ {0, 1} be a binary indicator that is one when there is a crisis in period t,
and zero otherwise. In this paper we investigate several features associated with such a variable.
A natural place to start is by asking whether one can detect such events in advance using
information from variables dated prior to the onset of the crisis. For this purpose, there exist well
known parametric models for binary dependent variables. Instead, we begin by thinking about
the decision problem faced by the policymaker. Suppose ybt ∈ (−∞, ∞) is a scoring classifier such
that for a given threshold c, then ybt > c is a signal taken to predict that St = 1 and ybt ≤ c
corresponds to St = 0 instead. Notice that ybt could be a probability prediction from a typical
binary model (such as a probit, logit, etc.); a linear probability model; a factor model; etc. For
the time being, it is not important to be specific as the framework we discuss is quite general.
There are four outcomes facing the policy maker, summarized in the following table:
Prediction

Outcome

Negative

Positive

Negative

T N (c) = P (b
yt < c|St = 0)

F P (c) = P (b
yt > c|St = 0)

Positive

F N (c) = P (b
yt < c|St = 1)

T P (c) = P (b
yt > c|St = 1)

where T N (c) and T P (c) refer to the correct classification rates of non-crisis (“negatives”) and
crisis (“positives”) respectively; F N (c) and F P (c) refer to the incorrect classification rates of
negatives and positives respectively; and clearly T N (c) + F P (c) = 1 and F N (c) + T P (c) = 1.4
A policymaker’s actions will be determined by balancing the costs and benefits associated
with his decisions and by the accuracy of the scoring classifier. Consider the first of these two
considerations. If π denotes the unconditional probability of a crisis and Uij for i ∈ {n, p} and
j ∈ {N, P } is the utility associated with each of the four states defined by the (classifier, outcome)
pair, then the utility of classification

U (c)

= UpP T P (c)π + UnP (1 − T P (c))π +

(1)

UpN (1 − T N (c))(1 − π) + UnN T N (c)(1 − π)

is clearly seen to depend on c.
4

Customarily, T P (c), the true positive rate, is called sensitivity and T N (c), the true negative rate, is called
specificity.

True Negative Rate

Varying c will naturally change the true and false positive rates of classification (and, hence,
utility). For example, if c is very large, then T P (c) → 1 but F N (c) → 1 as well. On the other
hand, if c is very low, then T N (c) → 1 but F P (c) → 1. For economists, a natural way to summarize
the classification ability of ybt and these trade-offs is to construct a production possibilities frontier
that plots the maximal combinations of T P (c) and T N (c) for different values of c ∈ (−∞, ∞).
Jordà and A. M. Taylor (2010) call this curve the correct classification frontier (CCF), a concept
closely related to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve in statistics.
The CCF lives in the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1], where a perfect classifier is one for which
T P (c) = 1 for any T N (c) and corresponds to the north and east sides of the unit square (see
Figure 1). An uninformative classifier on the other hand, is one where T P (c) = 1 − T N (c) ∀c
and corresponds to the north-west/south-east “coin-toss” diagonal. Therefore the closer the CCF
is to the north-east corner, the better the scoring classifier ybt . Jordà and A. M. Taylor (2010)
also show how to construct a utility-weighted variant of the correct classification frontier, denoted
CCF? (and to conduct inference on that object) in a manner consistent with equation (1).
The next step is to find the optimal operating point, which is determined by the tangent of the
policymaker’s utility function (1) with the CCF. However, in general policy trade-offs are unknown
7

to the econometrician and thus it is necessary to construct summary measures of classification
accuracy that, as much as possible, accommodate a wide range of scenarios.
Traditionally, one such measure is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic defined as:

KS = max 2
c

T N (c) + T P (c)
2


−

(2)

which is based on the distance between the maximum of the average correct classification rates
attainable and 1/2, the average correct classification rate for a coin-toss. Notice that KS ∈ [0, 1],
with 0 meaning no classification ability and 1 meaning perfect classification ability. Inference on
KS is relatively simple, although it involves some nonstandard distributions.

5

However, the KS statistic refers to a specific value of c that may or may not be relevant for
the decisions encapsulated by expression (1). This is especially true when the payoffs Uij are not
symmetric and/or the distribution of outcomes is particularly skewed, both likely features in our
data. In response to these difficulties, another commonly used statistic is the area under the CCF
or AUC. It is easy to see that for a coin-toss the AUC = 0.5 (the area under the north-west/southeast diagonal in the unit-square) whereas for a perfect classifier, AUC = 1, most applications in
practice falling somewhere in-between. Inference on AUC is very simple, since its distribution is
asymptotically Normal.

where the indices i, j indicate observations in t such that St = 0, 1 respectively; and I(.) is the indicator function
that takes the value of 1 when the argument is true, 0 otherwise. Then, it can be shown that under standard
regularity conditions:

where B(τ ) is a Brownian-bridge, that is, B(τ ) = W (τ ) − τ W (1) with W (τ ) a Wiener process (see, e.g. Conover,

Summary Measures of Spatial and Temporal Dependence:
Are Crises Random Events?

A central question for a policymaker is to determine whether crises are random events that are
no more predictable than the outcome of a coin toss. Under this null, there is little that the
policymaker can do. Under the alternative, the onus is on the policymaker to come up with
“early warning systems,” and state-contingent responses; and this in turn creates a need for
the development of macroeconomic models whose dynamics could explain the formation of such
extreme events, how best to avoid them, and how best to respond to their onset.
In this section we consider several nonparametric methods to assess some aspects of this null.
One area of immediate interest is whether there is any serial correlation or temporal dependence
in the binary crisis data. Another is whether there is any systematic spatial dependence. To
foreshadow out results in this section, we find no evidence of serial correlation in the crisis data
pattern, but we do find moderately strong evidence of some spatial dependence. Thus, in the
case of the big global crises, if other countries are having a crisis there is a good chance that your
country is having, or is about to have, a crisis too.

3.1

Duration Analysis

In the simplest of views we can think of crises as a Bernoulli trial with probability p. Under this
null, the duration between crisis events is distributed as a Geometric random variable. Under the
alternative, crises come in clusters, meaning that we are likely to observe a high proportion of
small durations relative to the theoretical quantiles implied by the Geometric distribution, thus
generating overdispersion. If one further assumes that the arrival of crises is independent across
countries, then, under the null, it is valid to pool observations across countries into a single sample.
We begin by constructing the series of spells or durations between crisis events for each country
and consolidating these observations across countries to generate one long series. During this
process, we drop left- and right-censored durations that occur at the beginning and end of each
individual country’s sample. This resulted in 58 complete spells and the histogram and kernel
density estimate for these data are displayed in Figure 2, with a mean duration between crises of
28 years and a standard deviation of 24. We remark that during the period 1940–1973 no country
experienced a crisis and therefore it is natural to consider whether this oasis of calm represents a
9

Figure 2: Empirical distribution of the duration between crises across all countries, 1870–2008

Notes: mean duration is 28 years, standard deviation is 24 years. Left-censored observations at the beginning of each countryÕs sample are deleted, leaving 58 complete durations. Right censored observations at
the end of each countryÕs sample are also deleted (but since most countries experienced a crisis in either
2007 or 2008, these coincide with the end of the sample in any event).

break in the stochastic process describing our data. Omitting this period, the sample is reduced
further to 44 completed spells with the average duration between crises dropping to 15 years with
a standard deviation of 8. However, the histogram and kernel density estimates have the same
overall shape and are not reported for brevity.
Hamilton and Jordà (2002) construct a dynamic model for just such discrete-duration data, the
autoregressive conditional hazard (or ACH) model and propose using simple autocorrelation and
partial autocorrelation functions (ACF and PACF, respectively) to diagnose the serial correlation
properties of the data. This is done in Figure 3, which reveals no evidence of serial correlation
in the data. Ljung-Box statistics fail to reject the null that the data are serially uncorrelated at
any lag between 1 and 10. Furthermore, omitting the 1940–1973 period does not change these
results in the least, which at first blush may seem surprising. Part of the explanation is that the
truncation results in dropping the longest spell for each country (14 in total so that we go from
58 to 44 observations) but these observations are not influential in explaining the dynamics of the
data.

Another possible manifestation of clustering over time would result in an empirical distribution
of the data that is overdispersed (see Hamilton and Jordà, 2002 for an explanation of this phenomenon). Therefore, an alternative first-pass nonparametric diagnostic of temporal clustering of
crisis events is a Q-Q plot.
Specifically, let n denote the 14 countries in our sample, each a time series with T observations.
Let Sit ∈ {0, 1} be a binary crisis variable for i = 1, ..., 14 and t = 1, ..., T. Then the maximum
likelihood estimate of p, the parameter of the Bernoulli/Geometric null distribution, is simply:
Pn

If the data are well represented by the Bernoulli/Geometric assumption, then a plot of the theoretical quantiles for this distribution against the empirical quantiles of the duration distribution (the
Q-Q plot) will generate a graph that traces the 450 line. However, if there is any sort of clustering, across time, then, specially in the lower quantiles, there will be easily identifiable differences
between both distributions.
The Q-Q plot is displayed in Figure 4 and shows that the data do not exhibit over-dispersion
with respect to the null of a Geometric distribution. A similar plot is obtained when omitting the
1940-1973 period. Thus far, the evidence points strongly against there being duration dependence
in the data that could be exploited to improve forecasting ability of crisis events. The next section
refines this analysis further with some recently introduced tools and examines whether crises tend
to come in country clusters.

3.2

Autoclassification and Cross-Classification Analysis

Even before examining the classification ability of any candidate explanatory variable (e.g., macroeconomic time series), perhaps the simplest scoring classifier one could consider are the lagged
values of the crisis indicator variable Sit . In a typical time series, the autocorrelation function is
a simple statistic that visually displays the serial correlation patterns of a variable with its past
values and where a white noise is the natural null model. Berge and Jordà (2010) introduce an
equivalent concept for classification problems that they dub the autoclassification function (ACF)
based on the area under the CCF. The results of the previous section do not suggest that there
is duration dependence but here dependence is assessed differently and in a manner that exploits

the full sample of 1,940 observations rather than with data on the 58 spells between crisis events
examined above.
The ACF displays the AUC values when ybit = St−k for k = 1, ..., q. Evidently, for k = 0 we get
perfect classification and the AUC is trivially seen to equal 1. On the other hand, if the arrival
of a crisis at time t − k has no impact on the likelihood of a crisis at time t, then its AUC = 0.5
(rather than 0, as would be the case when computing a traditional autocorrelation). Together with
the large-sample results in expression (3), the ACF provides a formal nonparametric method to
examine whether the arrival of crises over time is random. The plot of the ACF for the combined
sample of 14 countries in our sample is provided in Figure 5 and shows that even by this metric,
there is still no evidence of time-dependence in the arrival of crises. The reported AUC values are
statistically indistinguishable from the null value of AUC = 0.5.7
7 Moreover, unlike the duration analysis of the previous section, the ACF can be computed on a country by
country basis (Jordà and A. M. Taylor, 2010 discuss why, unlike other statistics, the AUC statistic is robust to
situations where the unconditional probability of observing an event is low, such as in our application). The results
of the per-country ACFs mirror that of the combined ACF displayed in Figure 5 and are not reported here for
brevity.

However, policymakers also worry about possible contagion from crises occurring in other
countries—is there a similarly convenient, nonparametric statistic that could evaluate such a
feature? We provide an answer to this question by blending the classification tools introduced
above, with tools from network analysis (see, e.g. Watts and Strogatz, 1998). In particular, we
consider two standard measures of network connectivity. The simplest one computes the incidence
Pn
rate of crises across countries at time t, that is, rt = n1 i=1 Sit . However, it is also common to
assess a network’s connectivity by measuring the wiring-ratio. The wiring ratio is similar in flavor
to a “majority voting rule,” a tool commonly used in pattern recognition problems (see, e.g.
Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, 2009), and has increasing marginal effects as the network’s
connectivity increases, as we shall see. Specifically, the wiring ratio, wt , can be computed as the
number of connected pairs (i.e., country pairs simultaneously experiencing a crisis) out of all the
possible pair-wise connections of a fully connected network.8
8

That is, if n is the number of nodes in the network (the number of countries in our case), there are n(n − 1)/2
possible pair-wise connections (with 14 countries this number is 91). Suppose that at time t, 7 out of the 14
countries experience a crisis. In that case there would be 7(7 − 1)/2 = 21 pair-wise connections for a wiring
ratio wt = 21/91 = 0.24. Compare this number to rt = 0.5 and then it becomes clear that, whereas the relation
between rt and the number of countries experiencing a crisis simultaneously is linear, the relation with respect to
wt is concave so that the marginal effect of an additional country experiencing a crisis is low when only one other
country is experiencing a crisis, but it becomes very high when many countries experience a crisis at the same time.

14

These two network connectivity measures, rt and wt , and their leads and lags can be used to
construct what we will call, a cross-classification function, a parallel concept to a cross-correlation
function. Specifically, for country i with crisis indicator Sit , compute the AUC based on setting
ybt = rt−k and ybt = wt−k for k = 0, ±1, ±2, ..., ±q. The top panels of Figures 6 (for rt ) and 7 (for
wt ) display the cross-classification patterns for each country in the sample whereas the bottom
panels of the figures display the time series for rt and wt , respectively.
The top panels of Figures 6 and 7 put these features in more formal context. When a crisis
occurs in several other countries, the likelihood that another country will also experience a crisis
is high, as shown by the high and statistically significant AUC value at k = 0. But how about
the power of a cluster of countries experiencing a crisis for the purposes of predicting whether a
crisis will occur in later another country? This is evaluated using the AUC values displayed to
the right-hand side of k = 0, and they indicate that there is some classification ability when such
a cluster is observed the previous year, but probably not thereafter: the AUC values under either
measure are statistically different from 0.5 for the first lag k = 1, but not by a wide margin. In
the opposite direction, that is looking at classification ability of past events, there is not much
evidence of a relation between countries experiencing crises simultaneously. There results survive
largely unchanged if one were to drop the period 1945 to 1973.
We begin by remarking on the differences between the latter: the incidence rate and wiring
ratio measures. Notice that when only one country experiences a crisis, the incidence rate is 1/14
but the wiring ratio is 0 so that the wiring ratio is a better measure for the purposes of computing
cross classification ability since it avoids some of the self-referential nature of the incidence rate.
Moreover, even when the wiring ratio is non-zero, its value will be relatively low when only a few
countries experience a crisis simultaneously, thus highlighting those episodes when many countries
experienced a crisis at the same time. In fact, our sample contains only five episodes in which four
or more countries experienced a crisis in the same year: 1890(5), 1907 (5), 1921 (4), 1931 (6) and
2008 (7). The bottom panel of Figure 7 helps visualize the oasis of calm between 1945 to 1973.
The lessons from the analysis in this section can be summarized as follows: (a) the likelihood
of a crisis does not seem to be influenced by the time elapsed since the last crisis experienced; (b)
about half of the crises in our sample (31 out of 71) occurred in only one country, nine episodes
involved two countries, and there were four episodes involving four, five, six and seven countries,
that is about one third of the crises (22) was experienced simultaneously in a cluster of countries

involving four or more economies. Therefore, serial correlation is not a concern, but spatial
dependence might be. Finally, these results remain largely unchanged to whether one includes or
excludes the seemingly long period of calm between 1945 to 1973. Building on these results, the
next section explores whether information about the macroeconomic outlook of countries can be
used to detect a crisis in the future.

Pre-Crisis Dynamics: Isolated vs. Common Crises

We begin our empirical analysis informally by compiling a number of stylized facts regarding
the international dimensions of financial crises. We start by looking more closely at the precrisis dynamics, differentiating between ‘isolated’ financial crises and clustered financial crises.
Subsequently, we will also turn to the macroeconomic effects of financial crises. In 140 years
of modern macroeconomic history, we identify five episodes in which a significant portion of
countries simultaneously experienced a crisis: the Baring-related panic of 1890, the U.S.-centered
international crisis of 1907 that led to the establishment of the Federal Reserve; the European
post-war crises in 1921; the banking panics at the beginning of the Great Depression in 1930/31;
and the global financial crisis associated with the Great Recession of 2007/08. The remaining
events are mostly single country crises (almost half the sample) with a few episodes that involved
two or three countries at most. For this reason, we break down the analysis into a global crisis
sample (which includes the international crisis episodes of 1890, 1907, 1921, 1930/1 and 2007/08)
and an national crisis sample, which includes the remaining isolated, contry-specific crises. We
use the terms “global crisis” and “national crisis” to refer to these partitions of the crisis episodes.
We summarize the behavior of key macroeconomic variables for the four years leading into a
crisis and the crisis itself. Unfortunately, we cannot perform this analysis for the 1921 crisis as the
preceding years coincide with the final years of World War One and its aftermath, a period heavily
distorted by the effects of disarmament and the return to a peacetime economy. We focus initially
on the prologue to financial crises. This is partly motivated by the fact that the aftermath of the
Great Recession is still unfolding and so the data are not in yet. We are also concerned that a
thorough analysis of the aftermath of financial crises necessitates distinguishing between normal
recessions and recessions that coincide with financial crises—which makes for a more complex
analysis. We return to this point below. On the more practical side, we adjust our data for

18

country-specific level and trend effects, to provide a common basis over which to aggregate the
experiences of countries with diverse economic systems and histories. Therefore, our transformed
data are best interpreted as deviations from a steady-state (so, e.g., a negative datum for inflation
refers to a demeaned/detrended level and does not necessarily indicate outright deflation).
We investigate three specific aspects of economic performance preceding a financial crisis: the
macroeconomic basics including output growth and inflation; the role of financial factors such
as interest rates and credit growth; and the external environment captured by trends in current
account balances. Figures 8–11 display the behavior of GDP and inflation, followed by interest
rates, financial and external variables. In all figures, for comparison purposes, the left panel shows
the average behavior (detrended and relative to country averages) of the variables in the prologue
to national financial crises, while the right panel is for the four global crises (1890, 1907, 1930/31,
2007/08) in our long-run sample.
Growth and inflation dynamics reveal some interesting insights. With regard to growth, we see
that national financial crises are typically not preceded by a period of higher growth. Questions
about the net real effects of financial boom and bust as discussed, for example, in Ranciere et
al. (2008), do not seem to arise for our sample as economic activity hardly accelerates before
crises. There is little evidence that growth is significantly faster in the run-up to national financial
crises. However, things are slightly different in the prologue to global financial crises. Here we
find that growth rates are elevated before the crisis and collapse stronger in the year of financial
turmoil (although the latter finding is likely to be driven by the 1930/31 collapse). Interesting
differences are also evident with regard to price dynamics. For our (predominantly developed)
country sample, there is scant evidence that normal financial crises are preceded by higher inflation.
But in international crises, inflation undershoots significantly relative to country averages. There
is nothing in our data that suggests that inflation trends help detect growing financial vulnerability.
The behavior of interest rates is perhaps the most interesting of all the variables under consideration here. Looking at both the ‘natural’ rate (short-term market interest rates less real
economic growth) and (ex post) real interest rates (adjusted for current inflation) we find that in
the prelude to the big international crises the natural rate was considerably lower than its trend
for an extended period. No such conspicuous behavior is apparent in the case of real interest
rates. If anything, in the run-up to international financial crises, CPI-adjusted nominal rates were
slightly higher than during normal times. In other words, the global crises of 1890, 1907, 1930/31

and 2007/08 were different in the sense that they were preceded by periods in which interest rates
were unusually low relative to the real growth rate of the economy. It is not impossible that central
banks could have misread the absence of inflationary pressures and kept short-term interest rates
too low, akin to the model discussed in Christiano et al. (2010).
The next two figures complete our description of financial variables. The first figure shows
broad money over GDP, the second panel bank credit over GDP. We have also run a comparable
analysis using proxies for banks’ funding leverage (loans over money) with similar results. Both
national and global crises are preceded by an expansion in money and credit. But the expansion
of bank loans is more pronounced, suggesting that credit, not money is the key variable.
What about external imbalances? The behavior of these is summarized in the next figure,
with the top panel displaying the current account to GDP ratio in levels and the bottom panel
displaying the change of the current account to GDP ratio. Both crisis types are clearly associated
with some deterioration of current account balances in the run-up to the crisis. But beyond that
we find little evidence that big international crises such as the one we recently went through can
be identified by glaringly abnormal current account trends.
Table 2 summarizes the historical evidence by looking at the cumulative effects before financial
crises by comparing the global and national crisis samples in the years leading to the financial
instability episode. Several results deserve comment. First, boom and bust dynamics seem to
be more pronounced in big international crises as measured by growth and investment dynamics.
Second, both credit and money growth are strongly elevated before national and global financial crises. Third, national crises are preceded by larger current account deficits relative to the
country’s own history. Lastly, we find historical evidence that the global crises occurred in an
environment of depressed natural rates (i.e. when measured by the difference between nominal
short term rates and real growth). In other words, international crises have tended to happen
after non-inflationary real booms. However, no such misalignment is apparent if real interest
rates are calculated using current inflation real interest rates. Prices were relatively static in the
run-up to normal and common crises. In light of the evidence from 140 years of modern economic
history, the big international crises are different in that they combine strong credit growth with
an environment of low real interest rate (relative to real growth) and tame inflation. External
imbalances could play an additional role, but at a first glance they appear secondary to the role
played by credit growth and interest rates.

Post-Crisis Dynamics

Turning to the behavior of key macroeconomic variables in the aftermath of financial crises, we
are interested in the question of how disruptions in financial intermediation lead to real economic
outcomes that are different from the normal behavior of these variables over the business cycle.
Financial crises often go hand in hand with recessions. But it would be clearly wrong to attribute
all of the output decline in recessions to the financial crisis. During ‘normal’ recessions, output also
declines and inflation rates fall. In order to isolate a ‘true’ real economic effect we therefore should
not compare the aftermath of financial crises with normal business cycle expansions. Rather, we
should compare apples with apples and test whether recessions that occur in the wake of financial
crises are deeper than ‘normal’ recessions. As an additional question, we can ask whether recessions

25

that are associated with the big-4 international financial crises show different dynamics.
While conceptually clear, the empirical implementation is difficult. First, a consistent business
cycle chronology is needed for all the 14 countries in our sample. This will enable us to identify
recessions that coincide with financial crises and normal recessions. Second, the exercise is further
complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the timing of financial crises for individual countries.
One could for instance argue that the crisis of 2007/08 commenced in 2007 in the US and the UK,
but reached other countries only in 2008. Such timing issues make it difficult to align crisis dates
and recession dates. We therefore opted for an intermediate strategy. In a first step, we compiled a
consistent business cycle history for the 14 countries in our sample by relying on the data provided
in Barro and Ursua (2008). We coded a business cycle peak whenever GDP per capita in any given
year was lower than in the preceding year. In a second step we made some manual adjustments
(documented in the appendix) to the resulting series. Manual adjustments were only made when
GDP recovered somewhat after a recession but failed to recover to the prerecession level and fell
again the following year. We treated such short-term rebounds as part of the same recessionary
episode and not as independent business cycles. Table 3 shows the resulting business cycle peak
dates for the countries in our sample. The third step was to align the business cycle chronology
with the financial crisis chronology.
Our aim is to examine the difference between recessions that coincide with financial crises and
normal recessions. We therefore aligned all variables of interest on the business cycle peak year. In
other words, whenever a financial crisis occurred in the year of, before, or after the business cycle
peak, we code this observation as a ‘crisis recession’, and all others as ‘normal recessions’ (including
instances when a financial crisis happened late in the course of the recession). Additionally, we
also differentiate between isolated financial crises and international financial crises. This results
in three different groups across which we compare the behavior of key macroeconomic variables
in recessions:
(a) normal recessions;
(b) recessions cum national (isolated) financial crises;
(c) recessions cum global (common) financial crises.
However, there is only one global crisis in the post-1945 period—that of 2007/08. The aftermath of this crisis is still unfolding, so we cannot study the post-crisis dynamics (yet). We are thus
left with only the first two groups (normal v. national crisis recessions) for the postwar period.

In the following charts, we contrast the behavior of key macroeconomic variables in the years
T + 1 to T + 4 after the business cycle peak with the three final years of the expansion, i.e.
T − 3 to T , where the peak is in year t. Looking at the mean change in normal recessions,
crisis recessions, and international crisis recessions, we aim to quantify the effects of disruptions in
financial intermediation. As before, we focus the analysis on three key areas: growth and inflation;
credit growth; external balances.
Starting with growth and inflation, we obtain a relatively clear picture that is in line with
previous research (Schularick and A. M. Taylor 2009). Recessions that align with financial crises
are about 1/3 more costly than normal ones. But this result only holds after WWII, not before.

27

Recessions accompanied by global crises stand out as the most costly ones, but this (prewar) result
is strongly influenced by the Great Depression. Price trends display a similar pattern postwar.
Inflation slows down in recessions, but more so in downswings that happen after financial crises.
We next turn to the behavior of credit growth in recessions. Both the pre- and postwar data
show a clear slowdown in loan growth in recessions (but relative to GDP it remains positive
pre-WWII). This reversal of loan growth, however, is considerably more pronounced in crisis
recessions. Loan growth was about 4 times weaker in crisis recessions than in normal recessions
after 1945. Before WWII, the slowdown in bank lending was only about twice as pronounced as in
normal downturns. This finding is confirmed when we look at the growth rate of loans over GDP.
In normal recessions, both pre-1945 and post-1945, the growth rate of loans over GDP hardly
slowed down at all relative to the pre-peak trend. However, in financial crisis recessions pre and
postwar, but in particular in recent decades, the growth rate of bank loans over GDP contracts
meaningfully.
Last but not least, we ask how external balances fare in the various recession categories. The
first insight we uncover is that the pre-WWII fixed exchange rate dynamics differ markedly from
the post Bretton Woods experience. In gold standard times, the current account level tended to
deteriorate both in normal recessions and crisis recessions. Only for the three global crises we find
that the current account improved in the recession. However, in the postwar era recessions were
consistently associated with improving current account positions. The same dichotomy applies
to normal v. crisis recessions in the two eras. Since the end of the Bretton Woods regime, crisis
recessions are associated with current account reversals even more strongly than normal recessions.
Before 1945 no such trend is apparent.
Summing up, we find conspicuously different post crisis dynamics before and after WWII. The
growth slowdown is more pronounced in the past decades. Inflation, however, slows down less
than pre-WWII possibly reflecting more active central bank policies to avoid deflation. Yet we
find little evidence that these policies have also succeeded in reducing output costs. Deflationary
tendencies are much more pronounced in crisis recessions than in normal business cycle downturns.
Crisis recessions also display a strongly negative impact on loan growth, possibly accounting for
the slower growth experience than in normal recessions. Unlike in the 19th and the first half of
the 20th century, current accounts generally have a tendency to improve in postwar recessions,
even more so in those associated with financial crisis.

Crisis Prediction: Do Current Account Imbalances Help
Predict Financial Crises?

Are external imbalances an important causal factor of financial crises? The idea is certainly
attractive. The global financial turmoil of 2007/08 occurred after a period of major imbalances
in the global economy, marked by large deficits in a number of countries, first and foremost in the
US. These countries at the recipient end of global capital flows also witnessed major asset price
booms and were the home of the financial turmoil that engulfed the global economy. Prominent
commentators have linked the recent crisis to external imbalance. To some extent, these issues
are open to empirical investigation. This is what we attempt to do in the last part of our analysis.
A large literature exists on boom and bust cycles in capital flows to emerging economies which
are thought to increase macroeconomic vulnerabilities (Kaminsky et al. 2004). Similar studies for
industrial countries are harder to come by. In the following, we ask whether the current account,
alongside other economic fundamentals, contains information about the likelihood of a future
financial crisis. We build on the crisis prediction framework presented in Schularick and A. M.
Taylor (2009) who stressed the role of credit growth in generating financial instability on a country
level. For this study, we have collected accompanying long run series for current account balances
for the 1870-2008 period. This allows us to answer a number of pertinent questions: Does the
historical record show that widening imbalances play a role in financial crisis? Should widening
imbalances raise concerns for policy makers? And finally, what is the interaction of capital flows
and credit growth in the origins of financial disruptions?
Using our long-run annual dataset for 14 countries, we start from a probabilistic model of
a financial crisis event occurring in country i, in year t, as a function of lagged macroeconomic
fundamentals, including current account imbalances, in year t,

logit(pit ) = b0i + b1 (L)Xit + eit

(4)

where logit(p) = ln(p/(1 − p)) is the log of the odds ratio and L is the lag operator. We are summarizing the information about lagged trends in macroeconomics using a 5-year moving average
term which allows us to introduce interaction terms between imbalances and credit trends in the
course of the analysis. The error term eit is assumed to be well behaved. We also subject this

specification to several perturbations that take the form of including additional control variables
in the vector X as described above.
Table 4 shows the results of our baseline estimations. We start by replicating the results from
Schularick and A. M. Taylor (2009) using a logit model with country fixed effects and introducing
the change in credit over GDP as the sole explanatory variable. Our key finding is again that
a high rate of credit extension over the previous five years is indicative of an increasing risk of
a financial crisis. Credit growth over GDP is highly significant, and the AUC test for predictive
ability of the model yields a solid (in-sample) number of 0.68, outperforming a simple coin toss
(AUC = 0.5) by a good margin. In regression 2, we let the change in the current account balance
over GDP enter the horserace. Widening imbalances are also a significant predictor of financial
crises, albeit the significance level is slightly lower and the fit much poorer. Equally important, the
predictive ability of the current account model is somewhat worse than that of the credit model.
The AUC falls to about 0.6. Note that we restricted the analysis to an identical sample of 1593
common observations for credit and current account data.

In a next step, we include both variables to see if additional predictive power results from
credit and current account trends. The result is by an large negative. The credit variable remains
highly significant and while the current account remains marginally significant, the AUC of the
combined model is only a small notch higher than in the pure credit model. From this perspective,
credit emerges as the variable to watch for the policy maker, not the external balance. A similar
insight emerges from regression 4 in which we additionally interact credit growth and changes in
the current account. Predictive ability rises only marginally indicating that credit booms fueled by
capital flows are not much different from normal credit booms. The CCF comparison is graphically
shown in the following figure. It can be easily seen that the predictive ability of a pure current
account model is significantly weaker than that of the credit model. Including the current account
and the interaction term (model 4) leads only to very small gains in forecasting performance.
Regressions 5, 6 and 7 add, additional economic control variables. First, a five year moving
average of real GDP growth; second, real investment growth; third, we add inflation trends. None
of these additions leads to meaningfully different results: credit dominates as the single most
important factor and a more complex model improves predictive ability only slightly. Overall, we
find only limited evidence that current account deficits have played a major role in generating

34

financial crises in the past 140 years. In the quest for financial stability, the historical evidence
would suggest that mechanism to restrict credit growth have better chances of success.
However, an objection to these findings could be that the global capital flow regime has changed
substantially in the past 35 years rendering long-term comparisons problematic. The transition
to floating exchange rates and capital mobility after the demise of the Bretton Woods system has
brought about a new ‘elasticity’ of current account balances. It is possible that the dynamics of
credit, capital flows and crises have changed accordingly. Taking this hypothesis seriously, we look
closer at the post-1945 and post-1975 subsamples. Have the relationships meaningfully changed
in the past decades?
At first sight, table 5 displays the familiar picture of credit growth dominated crisis histories.
Significance, fit and predictive ability are far superior. Yet under the surface a slight change can
be discerned. In the post-1975 period, the interaction term between credit growth and current
account approaches statistical significance. Also the coefficient is much bigger than for the sample
as a whole. There are also signs of a growing collinearity between credit growth and current
account trends: the correlation between credit growth and current account changes was low and
insignificant before 1975. But it has picked up strongly in the past decades, both in magnitude
and significance. The correlation of current account changes and loan growth is -0.15 and highly
significant after 1975, suggesting that higher loan growth went increasingly hand in hand with
widening imbalances.
Summing up, our analysis provides only limited support for the idea that widening imbalances have historically been a key factor in financial crises. Simply put, in the past 140 years
financial crises, driven by excessive loan growth, occurred by and large independent of current
account imbalances. In the past three decades, the interaction between credit growth and external imbalances has grown. We find that the correlation between credit growth - in the light of
our regressions the key indicator to watch from a financial stability perspective—and widening
external deficits has picked up considerably in recent decades. This points to a potential shift in
the crises dynamics and an increasingly complex picture where domestic credit growth and capital
flows are much closer to being two sides of the same coin than before. But it is too early to draw
policy conclusion with great confidence. The current global economic order, combining floating
exchange rates with capital mobility, has no historical precedent which makes direct comparisons
difficult.

Conclusion

140 years of lessons regarding financial crises and external imbalances are not easily summarized.
The picture we have encountered is a complex one. Our analysis of the historical relationship
between financial crises and external imbalances has proceeded in four steps. First, we have
applied a number of new statistical tools to analyse the temporal and spatial patterns of financial
crises in the past 140 years. Our key finding here was that such patterns are not easily identified.
Looking only at the incidence of crises across space and time, we cannot reject the notion that
crises occur by and large randomly. Yet four (five, if the European postwar crises of 1921 are
included) cluster of big international crises are discernible: 1890, 1907, 1930/31 and 2007/08.
In the second part, we looked in greater detail at the pre-crisis dynamics of various macroeconomic indicators. Three findings stand out. Loan growth is clearly elevated both before national
(‘isolated’) and also before global crises. The current account deteriorates in the run-up to normal crises, but the evidence is inconclusive in global crises, possibly because both surplus and
deficit countries get embroiled in the crisis. A key finding is that the natural interest rate was
strongly suppressed in the run-up to the four global crises in the sample while real interest rates
and inflation did not exhibit a meaningful deviation from trend.
In the third part, we studied post-crisis macroeconomic dynamics with greater granularity

36

than before. We distinguished between recessions with and without financial crisis, and recessions
following global economic crises. We find that recessions that are associated with financial crises
are more costly than normal recessions, while recessions after global crises are particularly hard.
While the Great Depression experience has a strong impact on this result, taken together these
results add further evidence to the expectation that the recovery from the Great Recession will
be sluggish. Regarding current account dynamics, we find that current accounts tend to improve
more strongly in crisis recessions than in normal recession in the post-1945 world economy.
The final prediction part of this paper addressed the question whether widening external imbalances are a signal for policy makers that financial instability risks are building. Our overall result
is that, from a policy-maker’s perspective, credit growth—not the current account—generates
the best predictive signals of impeding financial instability. However, the relation between credit
growth and current accounts has grown much tighter in recent decades. In a globalized economy
with free capital mobility credit cycles and capital flows have the potential to reinforce each other
more strongly then before. The historical data clearly suggest that high rates of credit growth
coupled with widening imbalances pose stability risks that policy makers should not ignore.

Appendix 2: Business Cycle Dating

We identify business cycle peaks using real GDP per capita. If output per capita growth was negative in
any given year, we coded the preceding year as the business cycle peak. We then adjusted the resulting
series for short term rebounds within recessions. These are cases when output rebounded but failed to
recover the pre-recession level and fell again in the following year. We treated such short-term rebounds
as part of the same recessionary episode and not as independent business cycles. Some minor adjustments
were also made when country histories and other data sources suggested a slightly different chronology.
For example, some differences may arise when accepted chronologies are built on higher-frequency (quarterly/monthly) data, in contrast to our annual data. In such cases, we moved the peak year by a maximum
of one year to align our chronology with the accepted country histories.
