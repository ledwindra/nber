An Empirical Analysis of the Fixed Coefficient
"Manpower Requirements" Model, 1960-1970
ABSTRACT
The fixed coefficient "manpower requirements" model is one of the most
widely used tools in the empirical analysis of labor skills.

The model

has the advantage of providing information on the effect of changes in
the industrial composition of an economy on demand for labor in highly
disaggregated occupations at the cost of neglecting factor substitution.
This study examines the ability of the fixed coefficient model to explain
changes in employment in 3-digit occupations in the United States from
1960 to 1970 and develops an "augmented requirements" model which uses changes
in wages as well as fixed coefficient shifts in demand to analyze changes
in employment.

The paper finds that 1. by themselves, the requirements

shifts account for much of the change in employment among detailed occupations in the period studied, though standard errors of estimate are
sizeable; 2. even with crude adjustments for factor price effects, demand
for detailed skills is far from zero elastic; 3. the fixed coefficient
model seems to work not because demand and supply are economically unresponsive but because the variation in the wage structure and corresponding
incentive to alter input coefficients is moderate relative to the variation
in the shift in demand due to changes in industrial mix.

One of the most widely used tools in the empirical analysis of
labor skills is the fixed coefficient "manpower requirements" model.
Variants of the model have been employed by the

u.s.

Bureau of Labor

Statistics to forecast manpower "needs" and provide guidance in vocational
decision-making; by the O.E.C.D. in its Mediterranean Regional Project
to analyze relations between growth and educational "requirements";
and by numerous developing countries as part of the manpower planning
process.

l

Wide usage notwithstanding, the fixed coefficient approach

has been severely criticized by many economists.

2

From the perspective of

standard factor demand theory, the main flaw of the model is its failure
to allow for the adjustment of inputs to changes in factor prices.

As

a tool of labor market analysis, the approach also suffers from being
widely used with extrapolative supply projections to forecast

3

shortages

or surpluses in a system that neglects supply as well as demand adjustments.
In large

~easure

because of the poor supply projections, requirements/

supply forecasts of market problems have often been seriously in error,
projecting "shortages" for example when "surpluses" in fact developed
(see Freeman and Breneman).
These difficulties notwithstanding, the fixed coefficient demand
model offers the only general analytic tool for studying the effect of
changes in the industrial composition of an economy on demand for workers
in a large number of disaggregate occupations.

The alternative variable

coefficient production function methodology cannot handle more than a
few different inputs due to the number of elasticity parameters involved.

this tradeoff is worthwhile is an empirical

issue dependent on the problem under study, the extent of disaggregate
shifts in industrial structure,and the extent of factor substitution.
To j4dge the usefulness of the tool. it is necessary to examine the actual
link between fixed coefficient shifts in demand for labor skills and
changes in employment at the level of disaggregation on which the analysis
focuses.
This paper presents such an investigation using data on 3 digit
occupations in the United States from 1960 to 1970.

It imbeds the fixed-

coefficient manpower approach into a more general demand model. in which
the fixed

co~fficient

calculations are interpreted as measures of

horizontal shifts in demand whose elasticity is set by standard substitution
considerations and. in which employment depends on changes in wages as
well as shifts in demand.

in industrial mix.

The paper is divided into five sections.

The first sets out the basic

methodology of the fixed coefficient approach and develops an augmented
requirements model [ARM] which also allows for factor substitution.
The second examines the variation in the changes in

~mp10yment

and income

among detailed occupations in the 1960-1970 period and the link between
changes in employment predicted by fixed coefficient shifts and actual
changes.

Section three presents estimates of the reduced form employment

and demand equations of the ARM model.

Section four seeks to explain the

greater variation in changes in employment than in changes in incomes among
occupations in terms of the estimated demand relation
high occupational mobility of the work force.

and the apparently

There is a brief conclusion.

The Model
The principal element in manpower requirements analysis is an inter-

industry model in which labor skill coefficients--the ratio a .. of workers
1.J

in an occupation i and industry j [N .. ] to total industry employment
1.J

[N.]--are assumed to be fixed.
J

The assumption of fixed input ratios

means that only a single observation is needed to estimate a .. (though
1.J

more observations should improve the estimates), which permits a highly
disaggregate analysis of occupational skills across industries that
would not be possible if substitution

parameters were also estimated.

S

With input ratios within industries fixed, the moving force of the
requirements model is the changing industrial composition of employment
(or output), which is taken as exogenous to the labor market.
if D

makes the overall response of demand to changes in

wages a weighted average of responses of demand within industries
(EYijnijWi) and an interaction term (EYijnijWiNj)'
When the interaction term is sufficiently small to be ignored,6 equation (8)
translates directly into the summary demand equation (5),7 with

Equation (9) shows that the elasticity of demand for workers in occupation
i is a weighted average of the elasticities of demand for the occupation
across the j industries.
When the interaction term is large, on the other hand, expression (8)
shows that (5) is not an adequate representation of the change in demand,
fGr it ignores the interaction effect.

I~ile

in general there is no easy

way to treat interactions, it can be readily seen that when the n .. are

According to (10) an appropriate specification of demand requires not
only shift and wage terms but also their direct multiplicand, which should
obtain a coefficient equal to the elasticity of demand.

Because of the

finite difference form, shifts in demand have small effects on employment
when wage changes are large while wage changes have large effects on
employment when demand shifts are large.
However one treats the interaction effects, the model of (1)-(10)
shows that the assumption that input coefficients respond to changes in
wages can yield a relatively simple generalization of the fixed coefficient
model, in wIlich changes in wages operate through a single elasticity term.

One additional assumption is needed for the demand model to be empirically
tractable.

in a large number of occupations, it is not possible to estimate (5) with

The augmented requirements model is closed by addition of a supply
equation linking changes in the supply of labor to occupations to movements
along a supply schedule due to changes in wages and to shifts in the schedule
due to other factors(such as changes in the sex distribution of the work

This equation shows that, on average, changes in employment depend on a

weights reflecting the relative size of the supply and demand parameters.

employment levels to predict shifts in demand for occupations.

These shifts

were then compared to actual changes in employment as estimated from the

In the B.L.S. matrix there were 142 industries and 286 occupations.

For empirical analysis the number of occupations was reduced to 254, with
such groups as unpaid family labor, apprentices, student nurses, some
'not elsewhere classified,' and certain other small categories deleted
or amalgamated into others.14

The major problem in analyzing the occupational change data is that
between 1960 and 1970 the Census altered greatly its occupational definitions,
expanding the number of categories from 297 (including diverse not elsewhere
classified groups) to 441.

To make categories comparable over time, the occupations

based on 1970 categories were transformed into occupations based on 1960 definitions

Table 1 of that volume provides data on the percent of persons in each 1970
occupation who would have been in the various 1960 groupings.

It was deemed

more fruitful to collapse occupations based on 1970 definitions into occupations
based on 1960 groups than to do the reverse because of the potentially smaller
error in aggregating than in decomposing groups and because of the desire
to preserve the actual 1960 matrix as the critical component of the analysis.
The 1970 industry figures were similarly bridged to 1960 definitions using
Table 2 of Technical Paper 26.
The other variables of the model were obtained from published Census
data as described in the notes for tables 3 and 4 and were similarly
'bridged' into 1960 categories using the same procedure from Technical Paper 26.
Changes in wages were approximated by changes in the average of the median
income of male and female workers in an occupation, using the proportion
in each occupation by sex to form the average.

w~ile

it would be more

desirable to have changes in mean hourly rates of pay, the published
Census data do not permit calculation of that variable for the two periods.
Shifts in supply were estimated from changes in the distribution of the
total work force by sex and education assuming that workers in a given
sex-education class had (with wages fixed) the same propensity to choose
a particular occupation in 1970 as in 1960:

.

The sax-education data were also used to calculate the mean years of
schooling of workers in an occupation.
Because of the bridging of the income (and other) Census data needed
to obtain comparable 1960-1970 categories, there is a potentially substantial

·11

measurement error for occupations which undergo considerable change.

To

obtain a 1970 income for a "1960 occupation" which was divided into several
groups in 1970, it is necessary to take a weighted average of the incomes in
the 1970 occupations, on the assumption that persons who would have been in the
1960 category are paid the average of persons in the 1970 group.

When a 1970

occupation contains several 1960 groups, this assumption is liable to be
wrong, leading to errors of measurement.

As some occupational definitions are

essentially the same in both years (accounting, for example) while other undergo
sizeable definitional changes (tailors, which in 1970 included what had
been previously termed operatives n.e.c. in 5 industries and laundry
and dry cleaning operatives) in some calculations the sample is restricted to
occupations with relatively small changes in definitions, thereby

minimizin~

measurement problems.

Patterns of Change and Interrelations
The pattern of change in the major variables of concern is examined
in table l,which records the standard deviation of the log changes in
employment and in wages among occupations and the standard deviation of
the log changes in calculated shifts in demand and

~pply.

Column 1 gives

the basic standard deviations while column 2 gives "weighted" standard
deviations obtained by weighting the observations by the square root of
the number of workers in 1960.

The weighted statistics have the advantage

of minimizing the impact of the often large log changes in small occupations,
where measurement error is likely, and of placing greater impor IDee on
the larger and more significant groupings.
What stands out in lines I and 2 in the much greater variat ion in
changes in emplovrnent than in changes in income.

0(1) is three times as large as cr(W).

Weighted by the square root of the number

of workers in 1960, the standard deviation of log changes in employment falls
markedly, indicative of the large variance in employment changes among
small occupations, but is still nearly 2 1/2 times the standard deviation
in the log changes of wages.

Indicative of the greater variation in

employment than wages in the underlying data, the unweighted average
change in employment in the ten fastest growing occupations from 1960
to 1970 was 1.13 log points compared to an unweighted average change of
-.73 points for the ten slowest while the average change in income in the
ten occupations with the greatest increases in income was .82 log points
compared to an average change of .14 points in the ten occupations with
the smallest increases in income.
The differential pattern of change in employment and income constitutes
a major empirical relation for the analysis of this study.

In the context

of supply and demand, there are three possible explanations for the enormous
variation in employment among occupations and relatively moderate variation
in incomes.

First, demand for labor skills could be highly elastic,

limiting variation in wages, while the supply of workers shifts greatly
over time.

This is the high elasticity of substitution interpretation placed

by various analysts on cross-country data on relative incomes and employment
among skill groups.

15

•
A second possibility is that shifts in the demand and

supply of labor skills are, for unknown reasons, positively correlated, preserving
the wage structure while altering the compositiun of jobs.

The third possibility,

to be termed the dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis, is that the supply of
labor is relatively elastic, which limits variation in wages, while the
demand for labor is highly variable, producing substantial changes in
employment.

In this case movements along a demand curve do not contribute

greatly to changes in employment not because substitution among labor

14
skills is limited but because wage variation is moderate due to elastic
labor supply schedules.
The standard deviations of the calculated demand and supply shift
terms in lines 3 and 4 cast light on potential explanations of changes in
employment.

They show that changes in the industry mix and in the sex and

education mix of the work force produced sizeable and comparable
dispersions in the shifts of supply and demand among occupations, which
implies a potential role for both forces in the observed differential
growth of occupations.

of 0.43 between D and S, the greatest possible variance on the right hand
side occurs when W is about one-half. With this value(15) yields a standard deviation
16
of .17, much below the observed value of .29.

The implication is that

the changes in employment due to unmeasured shifts in supply or demand
are also quite important.
Table 2 turns from the pattern of variation in the major variables of
concern to the univariate link between the driving force of the augmented
requirements model, the fixed coefficient shift in demand, and actual changes
in employment in th e 254

occupation sample. If D and L are closely
1
i

connected in the simple statistics presented in the table, there is some
plausibility to the fixed cOf'fficient approach; if not, we -should abandon the
exercise at this point.

.

.

Line 1 records the correlation coefficient between

Di and Li while line 2 gives the correlation between the variables, with

15
the observations by the square root of employment in 1960 in each occupation.
The weighted correlation gives greater weight to the larger occupations
and less to smaller occupations which, as noted, often evince sizeable
log changes in employment,

Line 3 records the number of cases in which the

predjcted change in the share of employment in occupation i has the same
sign as the actual change in the share,

It is a non-parametric statistic

that allows differences in demand or supply elasticities among occupations
to create differences in the impact of

Di on

ii but which requires that

shifts in demand dominate market outcomes in the sense of producing changes
in employment in the~)same direction as the changes' in demand.
The statistics show that the fixed coefficient component of the change
in demand does a reasonably good job of tracking employment.

.

Despite the

large variation in Li due to the changes in small occupations, the
correlation coefficient in line 1 is 0.50.

With observations weighted by

the square root of the number of workers in 1960, the correlation rises to
.,

0.66, so that 44% of the total variation in Li can be attributed to D ,
i
In 70% of the cases the direction of change is correctly predicted, a
result that is highly significant by the sign test.

shifts account for the differential variation of changes in employment
and in wages by detailed occupation?
As a first step toward answering these questions, the reduced form
employment equation (12) was estimated for several samples of 3 digit
occupations.

The dependent variable in the regressions is the log change

of employment in three digit occupations.

The independent variables are:

the predicted log change from the fixed coefficient model; the predicted
shif~

in supply; and the log of lagged number of workers in occupation.

The

calculations were done using ordinary least squares and weighted least
squares, with weights based on the square root of the number of workers in
an occupation in 1960.

Because of the potential heteroskedasticity of log

changes in employment in small, often ill-defined occupations,18 which may
be in part due to the fact that the data are based o? a 5% sample of the
Census rather than a complete count, the weighted regressions are more
desirable and will be given greater stress in evaluating results.

In

no case do results hinge critically on whether the regressions are weighted
or not.
The results, summarized in table 3, show that the demand and supply
shift terms have a substantive positive effect on employment, with the
coeficient on the former always larger than that on the latter, though
by an amount that differs depending on the weighting and sample.

In

line 1, which treats the complete 254 occupations in unweighted regressions,
a log change in D changes employment by nearly twice as much as a log
change in S.

In line 2, where weighted regressions are used, the

impact of the demand shift term rises while that

of the

falls, with a resultant differential of nearly 5 to 1.

In these cases, moreover, the differences

The sum is close to unity in lines 2-4 but exceeds

somewhat in the unweighted regression of line 1.

The ratio of coefficients

is always above one, by amounts ranging from 1.7 to 6.3, which implies that
supply is more elastic than demand.

Taking the restricted sample results as

be 2.5 times as elastic as demand.

There are two basic ways to analyze changes in shares.

First, information

theoretic concepts, which treat predicted or actual proportions, can be
used to calculate the "nits" of information given by the demand shift
model.

In terms of information theory (see Theil for a detailed discussion)

the inaccuracy of the fixed coefficient predictions can be measured by

Addition of the predicted change

in the share of workers supplying services to occupation i based on
equation (14) gave an insignificant negative coefficient to the change in
supply variable, indicating that with the change in share functional form
demand effects are the driving force of employment changes.

The Demand Equation
Direct estimates of the augmented requirements equation are given in
table 4 using both unweighted and weighted regressions.

Lines 1-3

record ordinary least squares estimates of the effect of shifts in demand
and of changes in wages on employment in the entire sample and in the
restricted

sample which excludes all not elsewhere classified groups.

22
Lines 3-6 gives instrumental variable estimates, in part to correct for
simultaneity in the determination of changes in incomes and in part for
likely measurement in the wage change variable.

The OLScalculations

provide a base for evaluating the IV results and may, because Census
income figures relate to the previous year, be sufficiently free of
simultaneous bias to provide a useful estimate of the elasticity of
demand itself.

The instruments (in addition to those in the equation)

are listed in the table notes.

Both the OLS and IV regressions accord a

significant and sizeable negative coefficient to the change in income,
which supports the basic notion that the fixed coefficient analysis can
be improved upon by taking account of movements along the demand curve.
In the OL5 calculations, the elasticity estimates range from -.42 (line
2, full sample, weighted) to -.61 (line 3, restricted sample, weighted)
The demand shift term obtains a coefficient close to unity in lines 1
and 2,suggesting that it does reflect horizontal shifts, but a smaller
coefficient in line 3.

In the IV calculations, the unweighted regressions

in line 4 essentially replicate the OL5 results in line 1.

The weighted

regressions in lines 4 and 5, however, differ noticeably from the comparable
OL5 regressions:

19

Even with this problem,

however, the results show that the augmented demand model offers a better
representation of demand than the standard fixed coeffici.ent model.

Further Analysis

be interrelated.

To test for the possibiliy of such an interaction, I

added the multiplicand of

DW is the appropriate interaction term and will obtain a negative coefficient

IV

The Differential Variation of EmplOyment and Wage Changes
The final issue to consider is the potential causes of the strikingly

greater variation of changes in employment than of changes in incomes presented

25
in table 1.

On the basis of the estimates of the augmented requirements

model, which of the three hypotheses outlined earlier--shifts in supply
along a stable highly elastic demand curve; correlated shifts in supply and
demand; or shifts in demand along an elastic supply shedule (the dynamic
demand/elastic supply hypothesis)--appear best able to account for the
observed pattern?
While not definitive, the estimated equations tend to favor the
dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis and to rule out an explanation
based on shifts in supply along a highly elastic demand curve.

First, as

noted, the reduced form calculations in table 3 yielded coefficients on the
demand shift variable
shift variables.

COrisiderab~y

larget than the coefficients on the supply

According to equation (12) this implies that the supply

of labor to occupations is more elastic than is the demand for labor.

Second,

the demand elasticities in table 4, though non-negligible, are much
below the magnitudes needed to sustain the argument that demand for
detailed skills is highly elastic.

.

Another way to judge the hypotheses is to use the estimated coefficients

on D and S and the variation of the variables in the data to calculate standardized
.
• 20
Beta weights for D and S.
These weights measure the effect of a stand&rd

.

.

deviati.on change in D and S on a standard deviation change in employment.
If demand shifts are the predominant force altering employment among occupations,

.

.

the Beta weight for D should exceed that for S.

Using the regression coHficients

of table 3 to obtain estimated coefficients and the relevant standard deviations
in

D and

in

·S

in the samples yields the following Beta weights:

Thus. in each ca8e,

the Beta weights for the demand shift factor exceed the Beta weig:lts for
the supply shift factor, implying that demand factors dominate the
observed patterns of change.

This does not mean, however, that supply

schedules were correlated at .43.

In all of the calculations

The shift terms in the two

Because the supply shift term treats

the educational upgrading of the work force and increased labor
participation of women as exogenous, however, it probably overstates the
"true" exogenous shifts in supply and probably overstates the correlation
between supply and demand shifts in the period.

To some extent at least,

the upgrading of the education of the work force and increased participation
of women are likely to represent endogenous behavior.

These considerations

strengthen the case for the dynamic demand/elastic supply interpretation.
The plausibility of the dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis can
be probed further by examining one particular component of supply, the
occupational mobility of the work force, on which the Bureau of Labor
Statistics has recently provided considerable information.

Mobility of

of workers from one occupation to another is, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics' study, a major
occupation:

el~~ent

in changes in employment by

from 1965 to 1970 the B.L.S. estimates that nearly one-third

of workers reporting in the 1970 Census of Population transferred from one
three-digit occupation to another while less than one-half remained in the
same occupation. 21

If this substantial volume of occupational movement

is related to economic incentives, an important component of the dynamic
demand/elastic hypothesis will be established.

If the movement is un-

related to economic incentives, it will be difficult to maintain the
hypothesis that the large change in employment relative to the change in incomes
is, at least in part, the resultant of shifts in demand along reasonablv
elastic supply curves.
To test the responsiveness of occupational mobility to market conditions,
I "bridged" the B.LoS. estimates of the percentaRe of workers in each three digit

27
occupation transferring to a different occupation (SWITCH) or remaining
in the same occupation (STAY) from 1965 to 1970 to be
comparable to the 1960 occupational categories used in this study.
two variables were then regressed on

t~~

indicators of economic

The

incentives~

the level of incomes in the occupation in 1960 and the change in income from
1960 to 1970; on the percentage of the occupation in 1960 who were women, on
the hypothesis that women are less likely to be occupationally mobile than
men; and on the percentage of workers aged 30 or below in 1960 and the
percentage aged 45 or over in 1960, on the hypothesis that young workers
are likely to be highly mobile across occupations and older workers
likely to be less mobile.

Persons aged 30 or below would be less than

35 years of age in 1965 while those 45 or over would be 50 years or older
in 1965.

Two functional forms were used in the analysis:

a log-log

equation in which the log of the relevant percentage was the dependent
variable; and a logit regression in which the log odds ratio of the variable
was dependent.

In the former case, the coefficients on the log of income or

on changes in log income represent the supply elasticities with respect to
the given occupation's income v€rsus income of all other occupations.

In

the latter, the coefficients represent the logistic curve parameters of the
effect of the variables.

The coefficients must be multiplied by l-P,

where P is the mean proportion who switched or stayed,to obtain elasticities
at the mean.

The analysis treats both the percentage switching and the percentage
staying in occupations because the two variables are not complements.

They

differ by the percentage of workers who left the labor force or died.

Because

the B.L.S. reported no figures in cases where the standard error on the
proportion exceeded 10 percent, moreover, the two variables are available
for different numbers of occupations.

In the samples under study there were

184 occupations with data for STAY and 158

occu~ations

The regression results are summarized in table 5.

with data for svITTCH.
What stands' out

in the table is the substantial and significant effect of the income variables
on occupational mobility, with changes in income and levels of income reducing
the proportion of workers who transfer out of occupations and increasing the
proportion of workers who remain in the same occupation over time.

In line 1

the percentage of switchers has an elasticity with respect to changes iil incomes
of 0.7 and an elasticity with respect to the level of income of .3.

The logit

regressions in line 2 yield different coefficients but imply similar
ela~icities (-1.01

and -0.33) at the mean value of SI.JITCR (.24).

In lines

3 and 4 the proportion who remain in an occupation has a somewhat smaller
but still marked elasticity, again of comparable magnitude at the mean
percentage (.55) in the two forms.

In all the calculations, the higher

the percentage of females, the less likely is occupational mobility, while
the higher the percentage of workers less than 30, the greater is mobilitv.
Since responsiveness to market conditions is likely to be greater
among new entrants (who have not yet invested heavily in occupations)
the estimates in the table provide lower bounds on the extent of flexibility
of the work force.

22

While more detailed analysis of occupational mobility

patterns, which takes into account incomes in fields to which persons
move as well as incomes in their 1965 occupations, is surely needed, the
overall impression is that occupational mobility patterns are sufficiently
sizeable and responsive to be consistent with the dynamic demand/elastic

30
supply hypothesis.

IV

Cone lusion
This study has examined the applicability of the fixed coefficient

manpower requirements model to changes in employment in detailed occupations
in the U.S. from 1960 to 1970 and explored the possibility of improving
the model by taking account of factor substitution at an aggregate
occupational level.
1)

The principal findings can be summarized briefly:

The fixed coefficient manpower requirements model can be treated

as a model of shifts in demand for labor in the context of a more general
augmented requirements demand model, in which movements along demand

sch~dules

due to changes in incomes as well as shifts in demand are treated as
determinants of changes in
2)

QT'l.~lc:~cn::.

By itself the fixed coefficient shift term provides a good fix

on changes in employment, accounting for about 60% of changes in the share
of the work force in occupations and 44% of changes in the log of employment,
weighted by the size of occupations.
3)

Allowing for movements along the demand curves induced by i~~me

variation tends to improve the analysis noticeably.

Direct estimates of

the elasticity of demand for occupational skills clearly rejects the
hypothesis of fixed or economically unresponsive manpower coefficients.
EstiIIiated (average) elasticities of demand with respect to incomes are on
the order of -.4 to -.9.

In addition, there is indication of interaations

between change in incomeand shifts in demand, which result from the finite
change formulae.
4)

The variation in changes in employment among occupations exceeds

the variation in changes in incomes.
of this phenomenon:

There are three possible explanations

movements of highly variable supply schedules along

elastic demand curves; correlated shifts in supply and demand; or movements

. .,.

31

of a highly variable demand schedule along elastic supply schedules, which
we have termed the dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis.

The evidence

suggests that the dynamic demand/elastic supply hypothesis explains atleast part of the -observed difference in variation.

Shifts in demand

for detailed occupational skills appear to have contributed more to
in employment than shifts in supply.

chan~es

The demand for labor in three

digit occupations appears to have a moderate elasticity.

High significant

occupational mobility seems to make the supply of labor relatively
elastic to three digit occupations.
5)

Since even the best fitting equations leave considerable standard

errors of estimate, the fixed coefficient model must be used cautiously
in projections and policy analysis.
Because of the great difficulties with changing Census definitions,
some of these results may be altered given better data.

The findings are,

hO'.vever, generally similar to those obtained in a comparable analysis of
the 1950-1960 period;3 when occupational definitions did not undergo
great change, and given the usual effect of measurement errors are, if
anything, likely to be strengthened bybetter data sets.

Overall, the

evidence supports the use of the fixed coefficient model in demand analysis
but indicates that the model can be improved by taking account of factor
substitution,even in a highly aggregate manner.

4In a general production function, which permits different elasticities of
substitution among different labor inputs, the number of Allen elasticities
i

is (;)

where i

= number

of inputs.

The technology is such that with

available data points, it is virtually impossible to estimate factor
demand relations for more than "5 inputs (10 elasticities).
5Since one form of economy wide substitution is to shift employment among
sectors with different skill mixes, the methodology does not,'in fact,
necessarily involve more rigidity than st:mdard demand models which focus
on factor prices.

A very detailed fixed coefficient model in which

industry scale depended on wages through the effect of wages on cost and
cost on price could predict greater changes in employment than would
occu= via factor substitution, industry mix fixed.

However, existing

models do not take industry scale as dependent on wages.

33

With changes in wages cfsay 20% (relative to the average change) and
changes in input coefficients of, say, a similar magnitude, the interaction
term would be just .04.

The actual standard deviations in N. and Wi

shown in table 1 suggest that unless n
is very large, or Nj and lo1 ~•

are extraordinarily correlated, interactions should have only a modest
effect on results.
7Essentially the interaction term is being equated with the residual in
equation (5).

Note, however, that n i is on average a "reduced form" elasticity rather
than the more fundamental elasticity of demand for the occupation with
an industry.

9An alternative way of going from equation (5) to equation (5') is to
assume that the elasticity of demand for

IIThis equation is essentially a stock adjustment equatlon in which Si + ¢\v

.

The stock of labor reaches an equilibrium, with fixed wages, when Si

The Bureau of Labor Statistics modified the Census data in several ways.
First they dropped "allocated" and "not specified" groups, distributing
those workers proportionately by industry or occupation.

Second, they

adjusted the Census data for seasonality (due to the fact that the
Census is conducted in the spring), by altering totals to be on a comparable
basis to the Employment and Earnings annual averages.

Third, certain cells

were adjusted so that row and column sums added up.

The following categories (with 1960 Census occupation codes in parentheses)

were deleted from all computations as not representing the type of
occupations of concern to a requirements forecast:

all apprentices (601-621);

unpaid family farm workers (903); bootblacks (820); newsboys (390); and
student nurses (151).

In addition, two not elsewhere classified (n.e.c.)

categories were deleted, entertainers n.e.c. (101); and professional,

.

technical n.e.c. (195) as being clear outliers due to bridging problems.
The following categories were grouped:

registered nurses (150)

and practical nurses (842); farm managers (222) and farm owners and
tenants (200j; religious workers (170) and clergymen (23); stenographers

Since

Attempts to estimate a supply equation based on the changes in

emplo)~ent

figures used in the demand equations of this study yielded weak
or perverse results on changes in incomes, presumably due to identification
problems and the mixture of age, education, and sex groups with very
different elasticities of response.

This suggests the need to decompose

carefully the various components of supply:

the supply of new. entrants;

the occupational mobility of existing workers; and to distinguish between
various demographic groups of workers and, where possible, various occupations.
