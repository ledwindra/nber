    "abstract": "\n\nThe economics of partnerships have been of enduring interest to economists, but many issues regarding intergenerational conflicts and their impact on the continuity of these organizations remain unclear. We examine 717 private equity partnerships, and show that (a) the allocation of fund economics to individual partners is divorced from past success as an investor, being instead critically driven by status as a founder, (b) the underprovision of carried interest and ownership\u2014and inequality in fund economics more generally\u2014leads to the departures of senior partners, and (c) the departures of senior partners have negative effects on the ability of funds to raise additional capital.\n\n",
