    "abstract": "\n\nUsing millions of father-son pairs spanning more than 100 years of US history, we find that children of immigrants from nearly every sending country have higher rates of upward mobility than children of the US-born. Immigrants\u2019 advantage is similar historically and today despite dramatic shifts in sending countries and US immigration policy. In the past, this advantage can be explained by immigrants moving to areas with better prospects for their children and by \u201cunder-placement\u201d of the first generation in the income distribution. These findings are consistent with the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d view that even poorer immigrants can improve their children\u2019s prospects.\n\n",
