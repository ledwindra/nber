ABSTRACT
We study how the maturity structure of nominal government debt affects optimal monetary and fiscal
policy decisions and equilibrium outcomes in the presence of distortionary taxes and sticky prices.
Key findings are: (1) there is always a role for current and future inflation innovations to revalue government
debt, reducing reliance on distorting taxes; (2) the role of inflation in optimal fiscal financing increases
with the average maturity of government debt; (3) as average maturity rises, it is optimal to tradeoff
inflation for output stabilization; (4) inflation is relatively more important as a fiscal shock absorber
in high-debt than in low-debt economies; (5) in some calibrations that are relevant to U.S. data, welfare
under the fully optimal monetary and fiscal policies can be made equivalent to the welfare under the
conventional optimal monetary policy with passively adjusting lump-sum taxes by extending the average
maturity of bond.

1 Introduction
Many countries have adopted monetary and ﬁscal policy arrangements that erect ﬁrm walls
between the two policy authorities. There are good historical reasons for this separation:
high- or hyperinﬂation episodes have sprung from governments pressuring central banks to
ﬁnance spending by printing high-powered money. This policy separation is consistent with
what Kirsanova et al. (2009) call the “current consensus assignment”: task monetary policy
with controlling demand and inﬂation and give ﬁscal policy the job of stabilizing debt.
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004) and Siu (2004) buttress the case for separating monetary
and ﬁscal policies with the striking result that even a modicum of price stickiness implies an
optimal policy mix of nearly constant inﬂation, while taxes adjust to fully ﬁnance government
spending disturbances, just as in Barro (1979) and Aiyagari et al. (2002). Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe (2007) extend their ﬁndings to show that optimal “implementable” rules also
entail the consensus assignment, an outcome later conﬁrmed by Kirsanova and Wren-Lewis
(2012), among others. The consensus assignment takes inﬂation ﬁnancing oﬀ the table.
Economic theory does not generally support the complete separation of policy tasks.
Phelps (1973) is the classic argument that in a second-best world, optimal policy calls for
a positive inﬂation rate to balance distortions among various taxes against each other. In
a stochastic world, the optimal inﬂation rate will vary over time. From this optimal public
ﬁnance perspective, the complete separation of monetary and ﬁscal policies enshrined in
the consensus is diﬃcult to rationalize. Phelps’s argument also ﬁnds voice in neoclassical
models with ﬂexible wages and prices, where Chari and Kehoe (1999) show that an optimal
policy generates jumps in inﬂation that revalue nominal government debt without requiring
changes in distorting tax rates, much as inﬂation behaves under the ﬁscal theory of the price
level [Leeper (1991), Sims (1994), Woodford (1995)].
Phelps’s policy prescription raises the practical question of whether the optimal inﬂation rate ﬂuctuates enough to justify considering policy arrangements that do not separate

monetary and ﬁscal policy. After all, many economists believe that in advanced economies
seigniorage is such a minor source of revenues that it can be ignored in policy design.1
Missing from the work that builds on Phelps’s insights is the recognition that when the
government issues long-term nominal debt, which most countries do in overwhelming proportions of total debt, surprise changes in current inﬂation and interest rates—even rather
modest changes—can have substantial eﬀects on the market value of debt, to become a
sizeable source of ﬁscal ﬁnancing. Hall and Sargent (2011) and Sims (2013) document that
these surprise changes are not at all small potatoes: Hall and Sargent compute that about
16 percentage points of the 80 percentage point decline in the U.S. debt-GDP ratio from
1945 to 1974 is attributable to negative real returns due to realized inﬂation; Sims estimates
the surprise capital gains and losses on federal debt to be the same order of magnitude as
ﬂuctuations in primary surpluses, about 6 percent of outstanding debt. Even when seigniorage revenues are small, surprise changes in current and future inﬂation may play a major
role in ﬁscal ﬁnancing. This paper abstracts from seigniorage to focus on revaluations of
outstanding debt by surprise inﬂation and interest rates.
Sims (2001, 2013) questions whether the consensus assignment is robust when governments issue long-term nominal bonds. He lays out a theoretical argument for using nominal
debt—and surprise revaluations of that debt—as a cushion against ﬁscal shocks to substitute
for large movements in distorting taxes. Sims (2013) stops short of claiming that the weak
responses of taxes to ﬁscal disturbances, which long debt permits, is optimal policy. This
paper explores that claim.
The paper follows most closely the linear-quadratic approach that Benigno and Woodford
(2004, 2007) developed. Deviations from optimality stem from the presence of distorting
taxes, nominal price rigidities, and a distorted steady state. Policy chooses sequences of
tax rates and short-term nominal interest rates to maximize a representative agent’s utility
subject to four constraints, given a government debt maturity structure: a consumption
Euler equation, a Phillips curve, a government solvency condition, and a term structure
relation. Government issues a portfolio of nominal bonds whose average maturity is indexed
by a single parameter, as in Woodford (1998). Like Benigno and Woodford, we assume
commitment and a timeless perspective.
A major focus of the paper is the role that the maturity structure of nominal government
debt plays in the optimal policy mix. Most work in this literature, including that underlying the consensus assignment, imposes that the government issues only one-period bonds.
Under this assignment, the maturity structure of government debt plays no obvious macro
stabilization goal, at least in conventional policy models.
The paper oﬀers a theoretical rationale for the empirical fact that governments revalue
outstanding debt with surprise changes in inﬂation and interest rates. While this has been
hinted at in previous work by Sims (2001, 2013), the present paper is the ﬁrst to show that
the revaluations are an essential component of optimal monetary and ﬁscal policies when
government debt has average maturities in the ranges observed.
Maturity structure plays a subtle role in determining the impacts of monetary and ﬁscal

King and Plosser (1985) observe that in the United States, seigniorage is about as important a source
of revenues as excise taxes. King (1995) reports that over the 45 years between 1950 and 1994, seigniorage
averaged 0.7 percent of GDP across the G-7 countries.

policies. Two eﬀects arise as the average maturity of debt extends. First, longer maturity can
relieve some of the ﬁscal needs that arise from ﬂuctuations in technology, wage markups, and
government purchases. Second, longer maturity permits future monetary policy choices of
short-term nominal interest rates to contribute to ﬁscal ﬁnance by changing bond prices and,
therefore, the market value of debt. Taken together, as maturity extends, it becomes optimal
to trade inﬂation stabilization oﬀ in favor of output stabilization and it is no longer optimal—
as it is under the consensus assignment—to fully stabilize inﬂation and allow output to bear
the brunt of ﬁscal solvency needs.
We calibrate the model to quantify the ﬁscal ﬁnancing eﬀects for a country like the United
States. With a post-war mean debt-GDP ratio of 46%, it is optimal for a country like America
to rely on surprise current and future inﬂation to ﬁnance about 7% of an innovation in ﬁscal
needs when the average maturity is 5 years. High-debt countries, though, would optimally
rely more heavily on inﬂation: about 11% with 5-year average maturity. Reliance on surprise
inﬂation and interest rates rises monotonically with average maturity.
Table 1 reports the average term to maturity of outstanding government debt in selected
advanced economies in recent years. While there is variation across countries, with Korea
at 16 quarters and the United Kingdom at 49 quarters, the median is about six years. We
show below that the presence of even moderate average maturity government bonds can
substantially alter the nature of optimal monetary and ﬁscal policies.

In the presence of distorting taxes, nominal rigidities, and long-term nominal government
debt, policy faces a fundamental tradeoﬀ between smoothing inﬂation and output—the two
objectives in the representative agents’ loss function—and ensuring government solvency.
Government debt maturity aﬀects how policy optimally makes this tradeoﬀ. For both inﬂation and output, longer average maturity enhances smoothing. In terms of responding
to ﬁscal needs, maturity aﬀects inﬂation and output diﬀerently: longer maturity makes it
optimal to allow inﬂation to react more strongly to shocks in ﬁscal needs, while the output
gap responds less strongly.
In the extreme case of only one-period debt, which underlies the work behind the consensus assignment, optimal policy makes the price level a martingale—perfectly smoothes
it—and forces the output gap to absorb disturbances. When nominal government bonds
3

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
are perpetuities, optimal outcomes are starkly diﬀerent: the output gap is a martingale and
inﬂation adjusts permanently to exogenous shocks.
Key ﬁndings include: (1) there is always a role for current and future inﬂation innovations
to revalue government debt, reducing reliance on distorting taxes; (2) the role of inﬂation
in optimal ﬁscal ﬁnancing increases with the average maturity of government debt; (3)
as average maturity rises, it is optimal to tradeoﬀ inﬂation for output stabilization; (4)
inﬂation is relatively more important as a ﬁscal shock absorber in high-debt than in lowdebt economies; (5) in some calibrations that are relevant to U.S. data, welfare under the
fully optimal monetary and ﬁscal policies can be made equivalent to the welfare under the
conventional optimal monetary policy with passively adjusting lump-sum taxes by extending
the average maturity of bond.
Contacts with Literature We integrate two strands of literature. First, following
the neoclassical literature on optimal taxation, when the government has access only to
distortionary taxes, variations in tax rates generate dead-weight losses [Barro (1979)]. Maximization of welfare calls for smoothing tax rates. If a disturbance to the government budget
occurs, the real value of government debt should adjust with the shock. This is possible
only when (i) the government can issue state-contingent bonds [Lucas and Stokey (1983),
Chari et al. (1994)], or (ii) the government issues nominal bonds, but unexpected variations
in inﬂation replicate state-contingent bonds [Bohn (1990) and Chari and Kehoe (1999)].
Neoclassical work abstracts from monetary considerations by assuming ﬂexible prices.
Another strand, the new Keynesian literature on optimal monetary policy, emphasizes
that when prices are sticky, variation in aggregate price levels creates price dispersion that
is an important source of welfare loss. A benevolent government minimizes price volatility.
This strand tends to abstract from ﬁscal considerations by assuming non-distorting sources
of revenue that maintain government solvency [Clarida et al. (1999) and Woodford (2003)].
We also connect to studies that focus on long-term bonds. Angeletos (2002) and Buera
and Nicolini (2004) examine the optimal maturity structure of public debt to ﬁnd that statecontingent debt can be constructed by non-contingent debt with diﬀerent maturities. They
consider only the case where prices are perfectly ﬂexible and the government issues only real
debt. Woodford (1998), Cochrane (2001) and Sims (2001, 2013) study nominal government
debt to argue that when outstanding government debt has long maturity, it can be optimal
to ﬁnance higher government spending with a little bit of inﬂation spread over the maturity
of the debt, eﬀectively converting nominal debt into state-contingent real debt, as in Lucas
and Stokey (1983). Both Cochrane and Sims employ ad hoc welfare functions to illustrate
their points, so neither argues that revaluation of debt through inﬂation is a feature of a fully
optimal policy. More importantly, they both consider a constant or exogenous real interest
rate, downplaying intertemporal eﬀects of monetary and ﬁscal policies.

2 Model
We employ a standard new Keynesian economy that consists of a representative household
with an inﬁnite planning horizon, a collection of monopolistically competitive ﬁrms that
produce diﬀerentiated goods, and a government. A ﬁscal authority ﬁnances exogenous expenditures with distorting taxes and debt and a monetary authority sets the short-term

is a one-period government bond with nominal price QSt ; BtM is a long-term government
bond portfolio with price QM
t . The long-term bond portfolio is deﬁned as perpetuities with
coupons that decay exponentially, as in Woodford (2001). A bond issued at date t pays ρk−1
dollars at date t + k, for k ≥ 1 and ρ ∈ [0, 1] is the coupon decay factor that parameterizes
the average maturity of the bond portfolio. A consol is the special case when ρ = 1 and
one-period bonds arise when ρ = 0. The duration of the long-term bond portfolio BtM is
(1 − βρ)−1 .
When ϵ → ∞, goods become perfect substitutes; when ϵ → 1, goods are neither substitutes nor
complements: an increase in the price of one good has no eﬀect on demand for other goods.

With demand imperfectly price-elastic, each ﬁrm has some market power, leading to the

Another distortion stems from nominal rigidities. Prices are staggered, as in Calvo (1983),
with a fraction 1 − θ of ﬁrms permitted to choose a new price, Pt∗ , each period, while the
remaining ﬁrms cannot adjust their prices. This pricing behavior implies the aggregate price

We consider a ﬁscal regime in which both Gt and Zt are exogenous processes and only τt
adjusts endogenously to ensure government solvency. This assumption breaks Ricardian
equivalence, so the government’s budget and the dynamics of public debt matter for welfare
and monetary policy can have important ﬁscal consequences.

Now an unexpected change to the present value of primary surpluses could be absorbed by
adjustments in current and future nominal interest rates, reducing the reliance on current
inﬂation.
Equilibrium condition (13) reﬂects a fundamental symmetry between monetary and ﬁscal
policies. The price level today must be consistent with expected future monetary and ﬁscal
policies, whether those policies are set optimally or not. Bond maturity matters: so long
as the average maturity exceeds one period, ρ > 0, expected future monetary policy in the
form of choices of the short-term nominal interest rate, it+k , plays a role in determining the
current price level.

the short-term nominal interest rate, it , taking exogenous processes for technology, At , the
wage markup, µW
t , government purchases, Gt , and transfers, Zt , as given. We derive how the
optimal policy and welfare vary with the average maturity of government debt, as indexed
by ρ. We consider the case of a steady state distorted by distortionary tax and monopolistic
competition and focus on optimal policy commitment, adopting Woodford’s (2003) “timeless
perspective.”

3.1 Linear-Quadratic Approximation We compute a linear-quadratic approximation to the nonlinear optimal solutions, using the methods that Benigno and Woodford
(2004) develop. This allows us to characterize the optimal policy responses to ﬂuctuations
in the exogenous disturbance processes within a neighborhood of the steady state.
In this model, distorting taxes and monopolistic competition conspire to make the deterministic steady state ineﬃcient, so an ad hoc linear-quadratic representation of the problem
does not yield an accurate approximation of the optimal policy.6 Benigno and Woodford
(2004) show that a correct linear-quadratic approximation is still possible by properly utilizing information from micro-foundations. Their approach computes a second-order approximation to the model’s structural equations and uses an appropriate linear combination
of those equations to eliminate the linear terms in the second-order approximation to the
welfare measure to obtain a purely quadratic expression.
We follow Benigno and Woodford’s micro-founded linear-quadratic approach for three
reasons. First, it allows us to obtain neat analytical solutions that help us to characterize
the properties of optimal policies and separate out the channels through which long-term
bonds aﬀect optimal allocation. Second, the framework nests conventional analyses of both
optimal inﬂation-smoothing and optimal tax-smoothing, providing an integrated approach
to the two literatures. Third, the quadratic welfare criterion is independent of policy, which
permits us to compare our results to alternative sub-optimal policies.
Welfare losses experienced by the representative household are, up to a second-order
approximation, proportional to7

One convenient way to eliminate the ineﬃciency of the steady state is to assume an employment subsidy
that oﬀsets the distortion due to the market power of monopolistically-competitive price-setters or distorting
tax, so that the steady state with zero inﬂation involves an eﬃcient level of output. We instead consider a
more realistic case, where an employment subsidy is not available. See Kim and Kim (2003) and Woodford
(2011) for more discussions.

3.2 Linear Constraints Constraints on the optimization problem come from log-linear

The exogenous disturbances generate cost-push eﬀects through (19) because with a distorted steady state, they generate a time-varying gap between the ﬂexible-price equilibrium
level of output and the eﬃcient level of output. If the steady state were not distorted, only
variations in wage markups would have cost-push eﬀects. This is why wage markups are
regarded as “pure” cost-push disturbances.9

[for example, Galı́ (1991)].
When τ̂t is chosen optimally along with monetary policy, then τ̂t can be set to fully absorb
cost-push shocks, making simultaneous stabilization of inﬂation and the output gap possible.

oﬀset variations in demand-side distortions.
If (20) and (23) were the only constraints facing policy makers, it would be possible to
choose monetary and tax policies to completely stabilize inﬂation and output. Policy could
achieve the ﬁrst-best outcome, π̂t = x̂t = 0, by setting
τ̂t = τ̂t∗

ît = î∗t

(24)

In the absence of any additional constraints on the policy problem, policy authorities who
are free to choose paths for the short-term nominal interest rate and tax rate can achieve
the unconstrained maximum of welfare. To achieve this ﬁrst-best outcome, policy must have
access to a non-distorting source of revenues or state-contingent debt that can adjust to
ensure that the government’s solvency requirements do not impose additional restrictions on
achievable outcomes.
When non-distorting revenues are not available, the government can convert nominal
bonds into state-dependent real bonds. If the government issues nominal bonds with average
maturity indexed by ρ, ﬁscal solvency implies the additional constraint

smoothing possible. A disturbance to the long-term interest rate can be absorbed by adjusting future short-term interest rates, with no change in the current short rate. By separating
current and future monetary policies, long bonds provide policy additional leverage.

The sum b̂M
t−1 +Ft summarizes the ﬁscal stress that prevents complete stabilization of inﬂation
and the welfare-relevant output gap. Given the deﬁnitions of τ ∗ and i∗ , Ft reﬂects ﬁscal stress
stemming from three conceptually distinct but related sources: the composite ﬁscal shock,
ft , the composite cost-push shock, ut (through τt∗ ), and the composite aggregate demand
shock, vt (through i∗t ).11
Contrasting (30) to the one-period bond case in Benigno and Woodford (2004), the presence of long-term bonds gives a role to expectations of future monetary policies. Monetary
and ﬁscal policy can be coordinated so that households’ expectations about future policies
aﬀect long-term interest rates to oﬀset part of the overall ﬁscal stress in the economy.
11

Ft corresponds to the ﬁscal stress that Benigno and Woodford (2004) deﬁne, but here it is extended to
the case of long-term bonds.

12

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
With Ft ﬂuctuating exogenously, complete stabilization of inﬂation and output, π̂t = x̂t =
0, which implies τ̂t = τ̂t∗ , ît = î∗t , will not generally satisfy (30) and the government would
be insolvent. The additional ﬁscal solvency constraint prevents the ﬁrst-best allocation from
being achievable. Any feasible allocation involves a tension between stabilization of inﬂation
and output gap, so the optimal policy must balance this tension.

4 Optimal Policy Analytics: Flexible Prices
In this section we characterize optimal equilibrium and policy assignment for the special
case of completely ﬂexible prices. This case serves as a baseline, since with ﬂexible prices
the tradeoﬀ between inﬂation and output gap disappears. It also connects to earlier work
by Chari et al. (1996) and Chari and Kehoe (1999), except that they considered only real
government bonds, while we consider nominal bonds. Flexible prices emerge when θ = 0,
which implies κ = ∞ and qπ = 0. Costless inﬂation converts the loss function from (17) to

The optimal solution entails x̂t = 0 at all times, which can be achieved if ﬁscal policy follows
τ̂t = τ̂t∗ and monetary policy sets the short-term real interest rate as ît − Et π̂t+1 = î∗t . In this
optimal policy assignment, ﬁscal policy stabilizes the output gap, monetary policy stabilizes
expected inﬂation and the maturity structure of debt determines the timing of inﬂation.

the expected present value of inﬂation. When ρ > 0, (36) implies that long-term bonds
allow the government to trade oﬀ inﬂation today for inﬂation in the future. The longer the

reminiscent of Cochrane’s (2001) optimal inﬂation-smoothing result.

(37)

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
and, as Benigno and Woodford (2007) emphasize, “optimal policy will involve highly volatile
inﬂation and extreme sensitivity of inﬂation to ﬁscal shocks.”
Flexible prices neglect the welfare costs of inﬂation. When prices are sticky and inﬂation volatility is costly, the optimal allocation should balance variations in inﬂation against
variations in the output gap.

With inﬂation and the output gap expressed as functions of only Lbt and Lqt , it is clear
that disturbances to the government budget or to debt maturity aﬀect inﬂation and output.
The shadow price of the government budget constraint, Lbt , follows a martingale, according
to (46), a property that reﬂects intertemporal smoothing in ﬁscal ﬁnancing. Lbt measures
how binding the ﬁscal solvency constraint is on ﬁscal policy. Lqt measures the tightness of
the ﬁscal solvency constraint on monetary policy by linking Lqt to a distributed lag of Lbt
with weights that decay with ρ, the determinant of debt’s duration

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
Maturity structure matters through its implications for ﬁscal ﬁnancing. How much monetary
policy is constrained by ﬁscal ﬁnancing depends on the entire history of shadow prices of
the government budget, Lbt−j , and the degree of history dependence rises with the average
maturity of government debt. Restricting attention to only one-period debt, so that ρ = 0,
Lqt = βLbt , eliminates the history dependence and monetary policy is almost as constrained
by ﬁscal solvency as ﬁscal policy itself is.12 At the opposite extreme, consols make ρ = 1,
so Lqt ≡ 0 and current monetary policy is not constrained, regardless of how binding the
government’s budget has been in the past, as long as future monetary policies are expected
to adjust appropriately.13
In general, the price of long bonds can adjust to relax the government’s budget constraint.
And the term structure relation, (29), connects the price of bonds today to future short-term
interest rates. Debt maturity introduces a fresh role for expected monetary policy choices
by allowing those expectations to help ensure government solvency.14
We examine some special cases that allow us to characterize the optimal equilibrium and
the consequent stabilization role of ﬁscal and monetary policy analytically.
5.1 Only One-Period Bonds Suppose the government issues only one-period bonds,
rolled over every period. Then ρ = 0 and (47) and (29) reduce to

Long-term and short-term interest rates are identical, so Lbt and Lqt covary perfectly. In
this case, the expressions for inﬂation, (43), and the output gap, (44), become

Condition (50) implies that inﬂation is proportional to the forecast error in Lbt .15 Because

implying perfect smoothing of the price level

⇒

Et p̂t+1 = p̂t

(52)

λ(Et x̂t+1 − xt ) = (Lbt − Lbt−1 )

This is precisely the exercise that ﬁnds the combination of active monetary/passive ﬁscal policies yields
highest welfare [Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) and Kirsanova and Wren-Lewis (2012)].
13
Sims (2013) limits attention to this case.
14
The new Keynesian literature emphasizes the role of expected monetary policy via its inﬂuence of the
entire future path of ex-ante real interest rates that enter the Euler equation, (21). The role we are discussing
for expected monetary policy is in addition to this conventional role.
15
First-order condition (46) makes Et Lbt+1 = Lbt , so the surprise is Lbt+1 − Et Lbt+1 = ∆Lbt+1 .

15

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
so the expected change in the output gap next period is proportional to the surprise in the
multiplier on government solvency today. The optimal degree of output-gap smoothing varies
with λ, the weight on output in the loss function. The bigger is λ, the more smoothing of
the output gap. Flexible prices are a special case with λ = ∞ and perfect smoothing of the
output gap. Under most calibrations, λ is quite small, implying little smoothing of output.
But the martingale property of Lbt implies smoothing of expected future output gaps after a
one-time jump. Taking expectations of (53) yields
x̂t ̸= Et x̂t+1 = Et x̂t+2 = ... = Et x̂t+k = ...

(54)

Taken together, (52) and (54) imply that with only one-period bonds, optimal policies
smooth the price level, while using ﬂuctuations in the output gap to absorb innovations in
ﬁscal conditions. The reason is apparent: with no long-term bonds, policy cannot smooth
inﬂation in the future and surprise inﬂation—and the resulting price dispersion—is far more
costly that variations in the output gap; it is optimal to minimize inﬂation variability and
use output as a shock absorber.
In this equilibrium, monetary and ﬁscal policies follow the rules

disturbances.

Condition (60) makes the output gap proportional to Lbt . The martingale property of Lbt
makes the output gap also a martingale, so the gap is perfectly smoothed
Et x̂t+1 = x̂t

Taking expectations of (59) and combining with (60), we have
Et π̂t+1 − π̂t =

Condition (63) implies that the expected change in the inﬂation next period is proportional to the forecasting error of x̂t . The degree of inﬂation smoothing changes inversely
with λ, the weight on output in the loss function, while the degree of inﬂation smoothing
varies proportionally with κ, the slope of the Phillips curve.
Combining (62) and (63), we draw opposite conclusions about the assignment between
inﬂation and output gap to the case of only one-period bonds. With only consols, intertemporal smoothing in the shadow price of the government budget constraint, Lbt , smoothes the
output gap, relying on ﬂuctuations in inﬂation to absorb innovations in ﬁscal conditions. To
understand this, refer to the government solvency condition

where r̂t,t+k is the log-linearized real discount rate. Consols introduce the possibility that
the bond price Q̂M
t can behave as a ﬁscal shock absorber: bad news about future surpluses
can reduce the value of outstanding bonds, leaving the real discount rate unaﬀected. A constant real discount rate smoothes the output gap, which explains the absence of forecastable
variations in the output gap. Variations in the bond price Q̂M
t correspond to adjustments in
future inﬂation. The longer the duration of debt—higher ρ—the less is the required change
in bond prices and future inﬂation for a given change in the present-value of surpluses. Although with consols it is optimal to allow surprise inﬂation and deﬂation to absorb shocks,
the expectation of inﬂation is stabilized after a one-time jump
π̂t ̸= Et π̂t+1 = Et π̂t+2 = ... = Et π̂t+k = ...

Notice that as ψ → 0, which occurs as the steady state distorting tax rate approaches 0, Lbt → 0 and
(61) approaches the conventional ﬂexible target criterion with lump-sum taxes π̂t + λκ (x̂t − x̂t−1 ) = 0 so that
the optimal inﬂation rate should vary with both the the rate of change in the output gap and the level of
the gap [see Woodford (2011) and references therein].
16

17

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
Monetary policy pins down expected inﬂation, but not actual inﬂation. Expected inﬂation
determines how much ﬁscal stress is absorbed through changes in long-term bond prices
and with more adjustment occurring through inﬂation, the output gap is better stabilized.
Fiscal policy determines inﬂation by responding to monetary policy and cost-push side disturbances.
5.3 General Case We brieﬂy consider intermediate value for the average duration of

The optimality condition for debt that requires Lbt to be a martingale may be written as
(1 − B)Et−1 Lbt = 0

(70)

where B is the backshift operator, deﬁned as B−j Et ξt ≡ Et ξt+j .
Taking expectations of (68) and (69), and applying (70), we obtain a general expression
of k-step ahead expectations of inﬂation and output gap
Et π̂t+k = ρk π̂t + ρk απ (Lbt − Lbt−1 )

(71)

Et x̂t+k = ρk x̂t + (1 − ρk )αx Lbt

(72)

Equations (71) and (72) neatly encapsulate the policy problem. The ﬁrst terms on the
right stem from the welfare improvements that arise from smoothing. That both terms
involve ρk means that longer maturity debt helps to smooth both inﬂation and output.
The second terms bring in the government solvency dimension of optimal policy through
the Lagrange multipliers. It captures the tradeoﬀ between relying on variations in inﬂation
to hedge against ﬁscal stress versus variations in output to absorb shocks. The average
maturity has opposite eﬀect on the two variables. As maturity extends, changes in the state
of government solvency are permitted to aﬀect future inﬂation more strongly, whereas the
output gap becomes less responsive. In other words, as maturity extend, it is optimal to
tradeoﬀ inﬂation for output stabilization. For any maturities short of perpetuities, 0 ≤ ρ < 1,
as the forecast horizon extends, k → ∞, expected inﬂation converges to zero whereas the
expected output gap converges to αx Lbt . In these cases, inﬂation is well anchored on zero,
but the output gap’s “anchor” varies with the state at t.

6 Calibration
We turn to numerical results from the model calibrated to U.S. data in order to focus on a
set of implications that may apply to an actual economy.
Table 2 reports a calibration to U.S. time series. We take the model’s frequency to be
quarterly and adopt some parameter values from Benigno and Woodford (2004), including
18

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
β = 0.99, θ = 0.66 and ϵ = 10; we set φ = σ = 0.5, implying a Frisch elasticity and an
intertemporal elasticity of substitution of 2.0, both reasonable empirical values. Quarterly
U.S. data from 1948Q1 to 2013Q1 underlie the values of sb , sg , sz and are used to estimate
autoregressive processes for At , Gt , τt , Zt shocks.17 Following Galı́ et al. (2007), the wage
markup shock is calibrated as an AR(1) process with persistence of 0.95 and standard deviation of 0.054. Table 2’s calibration makes the relative weight on output-gap stabilization
equal to λ = 0.0033, slightly higher than the value used in Benigno and Woodford (2007)
(λ = 0.0024).18

Given the ﬁscal stress, b̂M
t−1 + Ft , (73) completely summarizes feasible paths of current
and expected inﬂation and output gaps. To absorb exogenous disturbances to Ft , some
combination of paths of inﬂation and output must adjust. This equation underscores the
inherent symmetry between monetary and ﬁscal policy: interactions between the two policies
determine the reliance on variations in output gaps versus inﬂation rates.
Average duration of government bonds aﬀects the optimal equilibrium through three
channels. First, it aﬀects overall ﬁscal stress, Ft , given the processes of exogenous disturbances. Second, it aﬀects the allocation of inﬂation rates over time. Third, it aﬀects real
allocations through changing real discount rates.
7.1 ρ’s Impact on Ft Ft , a composite measure of ﬁscal stress, summarizes the factors in
our model that prevent complete stabilization of inﬂation and the welfare-relevant output
gap. Ft may be expressed in terms of the four fundamental shocks

The average maturity of bonds aﬀects the amount of ﬁscal stress imposed on equilibrium
through the weights attached to each fundamental shock. Figure 1 plots the feedback coefﬁcients for each of the fundamental shocks, as deﬁned in (74). FA is negative for all average
bond durations, while FG , FZ , FW are positive. A positive innovation to technology helps
relieve ﬁscal stress by raising tax revenues, improving the tension between inﬂation and the
output gap. Positive innovations to wage markups, government spending or transfer payments, in contrast, aggravate ﬁscal stress and make it more diﬃcult to stabilize inﬂation and
the output gap contemporaneously. The impacts of technology, wage markups and government spending shocks abate as the average maturity of bonds grows longer, while the impact
of government transfers becomes stronger with longer-term bonds. Finally, the impact of
each fundamental shock on ﬁscal stress is ranked |FW | > |FA | > |FG | > |FZ |. Wage markups
and technology shocks aﬀect Ft more strongly than do government spending and transfers
shocks. The complicated heterogeneity among diﬀerent shocks in aﬀecting the overall ﬁscal
stress makes some of our results sensitive to the calibration of the four fundamental shocks.

We turn now to study how the changes in average maturity of government bonds aﬀects
the tradeoﬀ between stabilizing inﬂation and the output gap. To distinguish the average
maturity structure’s impact on inﬂation and the output gap, we consider two polar suboptimal cases: (i) complete stabilization of the output gap, depending only on inﬂation as
a shock absorber and (ii) complete stabilization of inﬂation, using only the output gap as a
shock absorber.
7.2 Inflation Smoothing Complete output stabilization sets x̂t ≡ 0 and uses current
and future inﬂation to fully absorb innovations to b̂M
t−1 + Ft . This polar case eliminates the
eﬀect of maturity on tax smoothing and to focus on how alternative maturity structures
dynamically allocate inﬂation. Constraint (73) becomes

implies that increasing future tax rates decreases the path of output or increases current
inﬂation. When output is fully stabilized, inﬂation must rise. This inﬂationary eﬀect of ﬁscal
21

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
policy is absent from Cochrane (2001) and Sims (2013) and arises here from distortionary
taxes.
Figure 2 plots responses to a unit innovation in ﬁscal stress, Ft , under the two sub-optimal
cases and under fully optimal policies. Panel I imposes output stabilization, xt ≡ 0. With
only one-period bonds (solid lines), inﬂation jumps immediately and then returns to zero,
since intertemporal smoothing of inﬂation is unavailable. Lqt and Lbt deviate substantially
from zero, implying monetary and ﬁscal policy is constrained most tightly. With 5-year
bonds (dashed lines), inﬂation reacts less aggressively in the ﬁrst period, and then gradually goes back to zero. The presence of long-term bonds allows the government to tradeoﬀ
inﬂation today for inﬂation in the future. Lqt doesn’t deviate in the ﬁrst period but displays a pattern of gradual deviations, implying that monetary policy today could be freed
from the ﬁscal constraint if future monetary policies adjust appropriately. Finally, with consols (dotted-dashed lines), the immediate response of inﬂation is the smallest, with future
inﬂation permanently, but only slightly, higher.19
The pattern of impulse responses could be illustrated by considering the following optimal
problem

and E0 π̂t+1 = ρE0 π̂t ,

t≥1

If ρ = 0, we have E0 π̂t = 0 (t ≥ 1), inﬂation is expected to remain at zero after period 0. If
ρ = 1, we have E0 π̂t = π̂bπ0 (t ≥ 1), inﬂation is expected to deviate permanently by a constant
amount after period 0. If 0 < ρ < 1, inﬂation is expected to deviate by bρπ π̂0 at period 1 and
then decay at rate of ρ afterwards. The immediate response of inﬂation at period 0 is given
by
π̂0 =

bπ + bπ [(1 − βρ2 )−1 − 1]

(77)

π̂0 is decreasing in ρ. The longer the average maturity, the milder and more persistent the
inﬂation.
19

This result diﬀers slightly from Sims (2013), who ﬁnds complete smoothing of inﬂation with only consols.
Diﬀerences stem from Sims’s use of lump-sum taxes, which do not have the direct inﬂationary eﬀects that
distortionary taxes produce.

Changes in output help to satisfy the solvency condition by directly aﬀecting tax revenues
and by the impacts of output on real returns to the bond portfolio. These two parts produce
opposite eﬀects. Consider an exogenous increase in ﬁscal stress. Relying on tax revenues to
fully oﬀset this disturbance requires increasing the tax rate. But by the Phillips curve
π̂t = Et

∞
∑

∗
β k [κx̂t+k + κψ(τ̂t+k − τ̂t+k
)]

k=0

when πt ≡ 0, a higher tax rate must reduce output. This is the negative eﬀect in the ﬁrst
term. Lower output generates a second eﬀect by increasing real returns on long-term bonds.
This positive eﬀect is captured by the second term. The second eﬀect is usually omitted by
assuming a constant or exogenous real discount rate as in Cochrane (2001) and Sims (2013).
In our model, if we set σ = 0, then utility is linear and the real rate is constant. This mutes
the second channel and we obtain a smoothing of the output gap E0 x̂t+1 = Ê0 xt as in Sims
(2013).
Panel II plots responses to higher ﬁscal stress when inﬂation is completely stable. With
only one-period bonds, the output gap ﬁrst deviates by a small amount at time 0 and then
continues to jump to a constant level. Lqt and Lbt both deviate from zero, but by a much
smaller number than in panel I, implying that adjusting output gaps is less costly than
adjusting inﬂation. With 5-year bonds, output drops sharply in the ﬁrst period and then
gradually converges to the same level as with one-period bonds. With consols, the output gap
is perfectly smoothed after a one-time jump in the ﬁrst period. Long-term bonds allow the
government to smooth the output gap. To better understand this, we consider the following
optimal problem:

permanent constant deviation of the output gap; when ρ = 1, E0 x̂t = x0 (t ≥ 1), the output
gap is expected to be perfectly smoothed. When 0 < ρ < 1, ltx is generally time-varying.
Figure 3 plots ltx for t = 1, 3, 10 at all maturities. We observe that when the average maturity
is relatively short (under 5 years), ltx is time-varying and the output gap is expected to deviate
further and further as time grows. The output gap is expected to deviate the most when the
average maturity is about 2 quarters. However, when the average maturity is long enough
(over 5 years), ltx is almost 1 for all periods, implying perfect smoothing of the output gap.
Short-to-medium maturities increase ﬂuctuations in the output gap and long-term bonds
help to smooth the output gap only when the average maturity is relatively long.

8 Optimal Choice Between Inflation and Output Stabilization
This section brings inﬂation smoothing together with output-gap smoothing to examine
the joint determination of output and inﬂation in the presence of distortionary taxes and
sticky prices. With distortionary taxes, variations in tax rates lead to distortions in real
allocations and generates welfare loss; with sticky prices, unexpected variations in inﬂation
create distortions in the allocation of resources and reduces welfare. If there is a disturbance
to the government budget, monetary and ﬁscal policy face a tradeoﬀ between stabilizing
inﬂation and stabilizing the output gap. Panel III in ﬁgure 2 plots the impulse responses
under the fully optimal solution to a unit increase in ﬁscal stress. Responses are much like
a combination of responses in panels I and II. Both inﬂation and output adjust to absorb
disturbances to Ft .

Deﬁning Lπ = 2 E0 t=0 β qπ πt and Lx = 2 E0 t=0 β qx x2t , we can decompose the loss
function into two parts
L = Lπ + Lx

(80)

where Lπ measures the welfare loss from ﬂuctuations in inﬂation (expected present value of
welfare losses associated with inﬂation variability) and Lx measures the welfare loss from
ﬂuctuations in output (expected present value of welfare losses associated with output-gap
variation).20 For each value of average maturity ρ, we compute the value of loss function L
and the optimal mix of Lπ and Lx , which we plot in the two upper panels of ﬁgure 4.
The loss function is hump-shaped in ρ: when the average maturity increases from 1
to 2 quarters, the loss L, expressed in terms of the equivalent permanent output decline,
increases by 1 percentage point; after 2 quarters, the loss L decreases monotonically in ρ. To
see why the loss function is hump-shaped, return to ﬁgure 3. When the average maturity is
relatively short, the output gap tends to be volatile, increasing welfare losses. Our conclusion
is consistent with Eusepi and Preston (2013), who ﬁnd that medium average maturity is most
harmful for stability.
In the right panel of ﬁgure 4, the present value of welfare losses for inﬂation variation, Lπ ,
is plotted along the horizontal axis and the losses from output ﬂuctuations, Lx , is plotted
along the vertical axis. L = Lπ + Lx represents negatively sloped isoloss lines. Isoloss lines
closer to the origin correspond to lower loss. The optimal mix of Lπ and Lx is plotted as
shaded circles as ρ varies. For all maturities, Lx is almost 10 times larger than Lπ , implying
that inﬂation is better stabilized than is the output gap. Other dynamic patterns emerge.
As the average maturity of bonds moves from 1 to 2 quarters, both Lπ and Lx increase,
consistent with the increase in the overall loss function. As average maturity moves from 2
quarters toward consols, Lx decreases and Lπ generally increases: stabilization of the output
gap becomes more desirable from a welfare perspective as the average maturity of debt
extends.
To shed light on the relative importance of inﬂation versus output variation as sources
of welfare losses, the lower panel of ﬁgure 4 plots the ratios LLπ and LLx for diﬀerent average
maturities. When the average maturity is 1 quarter, Lπ accounts for 6.7% of overall loss while
Lx accounts for 93.3% of overall loss. As the average maturity gets longer, Lπ accounts for a
larger fraction of the welfare losses. In the case of consols, Lπ accounts for 10% of overall loss
while Lx accounts for 90%. There is a strictly increasing trend in depending on ﬂuctuations
20

We deﬁne Lx and Lπ using second moment of π̂t and x̂t intead of computing uncontional variance of
π̂t and x̂t , because with ρ > 0, x̂t and π̂t might have unit root, and the variances are time-varying. This is
analogous to Taylor’s (1979) policy tradeoﬀ curves.

9 Fiscal Financing
Sims (2013) emphasizes the role of surprise inﬂation as a “ﬁscal cushion” that can reduce the
reliance on distorting sources of revenues. One way to quantify the ﬁscal cushion is to use
the government’s solvency condition to account for the sources of ﬁscal ﬁnancing—including
current and future inﬂation—following an innovation in the present value of ﬁscal stress Ft .
The government solvency condition may be written as

Figure 5: Fraction of ﬁscal stress innovation ﬁnanced by each of the four components in (81),
as a function of average duration of government debt
Figure 5 plots the ﬁnancing decomposition for one unit increase of fundamental shock as
a function of the average duration of government bonds for the calibration to U.S. data in
table 2. The pattern of this decomposition is robust in that it does not depend on the nature
of shocks. In ﬁgure 5 the vast majority of ﬁnancing comes from a decrease in output. As the
average duration increases, ρ → 1, the importance of real interest rate adjustments dissipates.
In the new Keynesian model, real interest rates transmit immediately into movements in the
output gap, so at short durations, distortions in output are relatively big. As duration
rises, it is optimal to smooth output more, so real interest rate movements diminish. In the
28

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
limit, when ρ = 1, the present value of real interest rates is zero and it is optimal to make
Et x̂t+1 = x̂t and rely instead on inﬂation as a ﬁscal cushion.
Sources of ﬁscal ﬁnancing are particularly sensitive to the level of debt in the economy.
Figure 6 reports ﬁscal ﬁnancing decompositions under three steady state debt-GDP levels:
the calibration to U.S. data (49 percent), “low debt” (20 percent), “high debt” (100 percent).
As the level of debt rises, the reliance on tax ﬁnancing declines. With very short debt
duration, changes in real interest rates account for a substantial fraction of ﬁnancing in
high-debt economies. Reliance on real rates declines rapidly as duration rises, with future
inﬂation becoming increasingly important. With long-duration debt, high-debt economies
would ﬁnance over 20 percent of a ﬁscal stress innovation with current and future inﬂation.

10 Contrast to Conventional Optimal Monetary Policy

assumes a nondistorting source of revenue exists, so that stabilization policy abstracts from
ﬁscal policy distortions.21 To place the conventional optimal problem on an equal footing

Key earlier expositions of the conventional optimal monetary policy problem include Clarida et al. (1999)
and Woodford (2003).

Leeper & Zhou: Inflation’s Role in Optimal Policy Mix
with the fully optimal problem, we have the government optimally choose the interest rate
function, taking as given exogenous processes for technology, government spending, the distorting tax rate and wage markup; lump-sum transfers (or taxes) adjust passively to ensure
the government’s solvency condition never binds. In the conventional problem, the maturity
structure of debt is irrelevant. In this section we contrast fully optimal policy to the conventional optimal monetary policy. In both cases, we examine the case of a distorted steady
state.
Figure 10 plots the value of the loss function under the conventional optimal monetary
policy—straight yellow line—and under the fully optimal monetary and ﬁscal policies—red
line—as a function of the average duration of government debt. These calculations employ
the calibration in table 2 for U.S. data. The value of loss objective function under fully
optimal polices is hump-shaped in ρ, and even though fully optimal policies do not use
lump-sum taxes to make the government solvency condition non-binding, welfare is higher
under fully optimal policies if the average maturity is long enough (longer than 21 years).
The ﬁgure shows that welfare under the two optimal policy regimes can be made equivalent
by extending the average maturity of bond. However, this welfare-equivalence result and the
level of average maturity that achieves the the welfare-equivalence might be sensitive to our
calibration.
Figure 10 reports the implications of average debt levels for the threshold value of average
maturity that achieves equivalent welfares between fully optimal policies and conventional
optimal monetary policy. We consider the range of [20%, 100%], which covers most countries’
debt-to-GDP ratios in the world. We see that when the debt-to-GDP ratio is at low level
(below 40%), no average maturity exists that achieves equivalent welfares: welfare under
fully optimal polices is always inferior to the conventional optimal monetary policy with
lump-sum taxes, no matter how long the average maturity. It is possible to achieve welfare
equivalence only in medium- to high- debt economies, that is, only when debt-to-GDP ratio
is higher than 40%. Moreover, the higher the debt levels, the shorter the threshold value of
average maturity to achieve welfare equivalence.
Figure 10 reports the implications of standard deviations of wage markup shock for the
threshold value of average maturity that achieves equivalent welfares between fully optimal
policies and conventional optimal monetary policy. We consider the range of [0.02, 0.06],
which covers most calibrations of standard deviation of wage markup in the literatures.

11 Concluding Remarks
This paper examines the joint determination of optimal monetary and ﬁscal policy in the
presence of distorting tax and sticky prices. We study how the presence of long-term bonds
aﬀects optimal allocations between inﬂation and output gap, and the consequent stabilization
role for monetary and ﬁscal policy.
We identiﬁed three channels for long-term bonds to have eﬀect on optimal allocations
between inﬂation and output gap. First, long-term bonds aﬀect the aggregate ﬁscal stress
imposed on the intertemporal solvency condition that prevents complete stabilization of
inﬂation and welfare-relevant output gap. Second, long-term bonds facilitate intertemporal
smoothing for inﬂation. Third, which is new in our paper, long-term bond also smoothes
welfare-relevant output gap by smoothing real interest rates.

Figure 8: Threshold level of average maturity that equates welfare under fully optimal
monetary and ﬁscal policies and welfare under conventional optimal monetary policy with
passively adjusting lump-sum taxes, as a function of debt-output ratio
To study inﬂation’s role as a “ﬁscal cushion,” we use the government’s solvency condition
to account for the sources of ﬁscal ﬁnancing. As the duration of government debt rises, it
is optimal to smooth output more and to rely on current and future inﬂation innovations
to revalue government bond. In the limit, with only consol debt, it is optimal to perfectly
smooth real interest rates and rely instead on inﬂation as a ﬁscal cushion. Sources of ﬁscal
ﬁnancing are also sensitive to the level of debt in the economy. As the level of bonds rises,
the reliance on tax ﬁnancing declines. With long-duration bond, high-debt economies (100%
debt to GDP ratio) would ﬁnance over 20 percent of a ﬁscal stress innovation with current
and future inﬂation.

Finally, we contrast the welfare under fully optimal policy to the conventional optimal
monetary policy case where lump-sum taxes are available to always guarantee government
solvency. We show that welfare under the two optimal policy regimes can be made equivalent
by extending the average maturity of bond.

3.2, line 12).
Total government transfers, Z. Federal current transfer payments (Table 3.2, line 22) minus
Federal current transfer receipts (Table 3.2, line 16) plus Federal capital transfers payments (Table
3.2, line 43) minus Federal capital transfer receipts (Table 3.2, line 39) plus Federal subsidies (Table
3.2, line 32).

Total factor productivity, A. Business sector total factor productivity, produced on 03May-2013 by John Fernald/Kuni Natsuki, http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/total-factorproductivity-tfp/. All published variables are log-diﬀerenced and annualized. To be consistent
with model with ﬁxed capital, we compute dA = dY − (dhours + dLQ), where dhours and dLQ are
business sector hours and labor composition/quality actually used. Given dAt = 400 ∗ log(At ) −
log(At−1 ), we compute the annualized level of TFP, normalizing A1947Q1 = 1.

We use data from 1948Q1 to 2013Q1 to calibrate the model to U.S. data. For steady states,
we use the sample means reported below. For the quarterly calibration, we multiply B/Y by
4. Lump-sum transfers as a share of GDP adjust to satisfy the steady state government budget
constraint.
To calibrate the exogenous processes, we apply a Hodrick and Prescott (1997) ﬁlter to time
series on Gt , τt , Zt , and At and estimate AR(1) processes using the cyclical components of the
ﬁltered data, denoting those components by ĝt , τ̂t , ẑt , ât . Let the AR(1) be x̂t = ρx x̂t−1 + εxt with
standard error of estimate σε . Estimates appear below with standard errors in parentheses.
