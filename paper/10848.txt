The Elusive Welfare Economics of Price Stability as a Monetary Policy Objective: Should New
Keynesian Central Bankers Pursue Price Stability?
Willem H. Buiter
NBER Working Paper No. 10848
October 2004
JEL No. E3, E4, E5, E6
ABSTRACT
The paper studies the inflation rate associated with optimal monetary policy in a standard
suite of DSGE models, when fiscal policy is either unrestricted optimal or restricted but supportive
of monetary policy. Full nominal price flexibility, nominal prices set one period in advance and
Calvo-style staggered overlapping price contracts with a variety of indexation rules for constrained
price setters are considered.
For all price setting models, optimal monetary policy implements the Bailey-Friedman
Optimal Quantity of Money (OQM) rule: the pecuniary opportunity cost of holding money is equal
to zero.
There is an optimal inflation rate for producer prices in the Calvo model, given by the 'core
inflation' process generated by the indexation rule of the constrained price setters. It is constant only
if core inflation is constant.
A zero rate of producer price inflation is necessary for optimality in the Calvo model, only
if all of the following conditions hold.
(1) There is no money or the nominal interest rate on money can be set freely.
(2) The constrained price setters of the Calvo model implement an ill-posed, arbitrary
price indexation rule, such as the lagged partial indexation rule used by Woodford
to make a case for price stability.
(3) The authorities use neither their tax instruments nor the nominal interest rate to
validate the core inflation process.
These results are global - they do not depend on linear approximations at a deterministic,
zero-inflation steady state.

Introduction

The pursuit of an in‡ation target as the overriding priority of monetary policy has become, alongside central bank operational independence, the de…ning attribute of a modern
monetary authority under a ‡oating exchange rate regime (see e.g. Mishkin [36], King
[32], Svensson [38], and Svensson and Woodford [39] and the other papers contained in
the volume edited by Bernanke and Woodford [3]). The Reserve Bank of New Zealand
led the way in 1989 and 1990.1 The UK and Japan were early converts. The European
Central Bank has an in‡ation target that dare not speak its name (albeit an asymmetric
and rather awkward one). Of the leading central banks only the Fed has not adopted
in‡ation targeting and even there in‡uential voices are arguing that it should do so.
The most common rationale for the adoption of an in‡ation target is that this represents an operationally simple and transparent way to pursue price stability. Given the
(mainly upward) biases in the real-world price indices used to de…ne the in‡ation target,
a low positive target rate of in‡ation provides an imperfect observable proxy for a zero
rate of in‡ation of the unobservable true price index or ideal cost of living index.
Abstracting from measurement errors, what are the welfare economic arguments for
price stability (de…ned as a zero rate of in‡ation going forward) as an objective, or even
the overriding objective, of monetary policy? In a recent in‡uential contribution to this
topic, Woodford [41] has made a case based on the optimisation of a utilitarian social
welfare function in an economy with sluggish price adjustment. A central result of this
paper is the demonstration that Woodford’s argument for targeting zero in‡ation is not
robust in the very class of New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models
considered by him. For it to be valid it must be the case that private price setters never
learn, even when they should, and that the policy authorities never act, even though they
1

The exact dating of the adoption of in‡ation targeting by the New Zealand authorities is di¢ cult.
According to the Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Archer [1], footnote 3): "By
mid 1989 announced policy included a speci…c target for in‡ation and a speci…c date for that target to
be achieved, a target that the Reserve Bank was following. But it was not until early 1990 that the full
formal paraphernalia of in‡ation targeting New Zealand style was in place."

could.
The paper studies optimal monetary policy and the in‡ation rate associated with
optimal monetary policy in a popular, standard ’suite’ of dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium models. Optimal policy is derived from the optimisation of a utilitarian
social welfare function by a benevolent government capable of credible commitment.
Consumption, labour supply, production of market goods, price setting, portfolio choice
and money demand are derived from the optimising choices of a (quasi-) representative
in…nite-lived household-producer in an endowment economy.2 For simplicity, there is
assumed to be a su¢ ciently rich set of …nancial markets to permit e¢ cient risk-trading
and, in equilibrium, complete risk sharing. There is Dixit-Stiglitz [21] monopolistically
competitive price setting by producers of di¤erentiated commodities. The paper considers
full nominal price ‡exibility, nominal prices set one period in advance and Calvo-style
staggered overlapping price contracts with a number of price indexation rules for the
constrained price setters (see [15]).
Monetary policy means the authorities choosing either sequences of or rules for the
risk-free short (one-period) nominal interest rates on money and on non-monetary …nancial instruments (bonds). ’Authorities’ means the consolidated monetary and …scal
authorities.
There are a few relatively minor di¤erences between the model of this paper and the
’industry standard’found e.g. in Woodford [41], as well as two key di¤erences. As regards
the former, the demand for money re‡ects both the ’credit goods - cash goods’variant
of the cash-in-advance model and the Allais-Baumol-Tobin shoe-leather costs approach.
Leisure does double duty as non-market good and credit good.

It follows that there

are two monetary distortions when the pecuniary opportunity cost of holding money is
positive: shoe-leather costs are excessive and the relative price of cash goods to credit
goods is too high. This emphasis on the role of money and the potential presence of
2

Quasi-representative, because individual endowments may di¤er and the tax rates faced by individual
household-producers may di¤er.

2

multiple monetary distortions is intended as an antidote to recent theoretical work that
over-anticipates possible future technological and institutional developments leading to
a cashless society, that is, a world without a unique, distinct, government-issued means
of payment and medium of exchange (see e.g. Friedman [26], Freedman [25], Costa and
deGrauwe [19], Goodhart [30], Hall [31] and Woodford [41]). In a cashless economy,
monetary economics becomes pure numérairology: of the store of value, medium of exchange/means of payment and unit of account triad, only the last role of the monetary
unit remains. This paper’s maintained hypothesis is that the means-of-payment/medium
of exchange role of money still matters, although the cashless economy is considered as
a special case.
The main di¤erences between the existing literature and the model of this paper
are, …rst, the attention paid to the price indexation rule adopted by constrained price
setters in the Calvo-style price setting model and, second, the careful modelling of the
’non-Keynesian’e¤ects of …scal policy. Because the authorities are assumed to have unrestricted access to lump-sum taxes, there is Ricardian equivalence: holding constant the
sequence of real public spending on goods and services, the growth rate of the nominal
money stock and all non-lump-sum taxes, the timing of lump–sum taxation has no implications for either nominal or real equilibrium values. Real public spending is assumed
to be exogenous.
The interesting …scal instruments in this model are the non-lump-sum taxes and
subsidies. Woodford [41] introduces a production tax/subsidy in his model to eliminate
the excess burden of monopoly power. In the present paper, there are both commodityspeci…c proportional production taxes/subsidies and a uniform consumption tax or …nal
sales tax. One immediate consequence of introducing a consumption tax is the need to
distinguish between the market prices faced by consumers (and the associated aggregate
consumer price index), which include the consumption tax, and the prices set by producers
(and the associated aggregate producer price index or factor cost price index), which
exclude the consumption tax.

Calvo-style nominal rigidities are associated with the
3

prices set by producers. The consumption tax (the only indirect tax in our model), drives
a wedge between consumer prices and producer prices. In conjunction with commodityspeci…c production taxes (the distortionary direct taxes in our model) they can either,
if the authorities are highly informed and ‡exible, completely undo the ine¢ ciencies
introduced by any Calvo price setting scheme and indexation rule, or, if the authorities are
restricted to simple feedback rules for their taxes, eliminate enough of these ine¢ ciencies
to ensure that the real equilibrium (relative prices, real output, real consumption, real
interest rates) becomes invariant under alternative in‡ation rates of the consumer and
producer price indices.
A key …nding is that for all price setting models considered, optimal monetary policy
implements the Bailey-Friedman Optimal Quantity of Money (OQM) rule: the pecuniary
opportunity cost of holding money is set equal to zero (see Bailey [2] and Friedman [27]).
If the nominal interest rate on money can be set freely, the OQM rule does not pin down
the risk-free nominal interest rate on bonds. The rate of in‡ation of consumer prices
(and for constant indirect taxes) also for consumer prices, will vary one-for-one with the
common value assigned to the two risk-free nominal interest rates, but that common
value itself can be anything. If the nominal interest rate on money is constrained to
equal zero, the optimum rate of consumer price in‡ation is that associated with a zero
risk-free nominal interest rate on bonds. In the familiar special case of a non-stochastic
steady state, the rate of consumer price in‡ation will then be equal to minus the pure
rate of time preference.
The rate of producer price in‡ation depends, given the rate of consumer price in‡ation,
on the behaviour over time of the consumption tax rate.

If the nominal interest rate

money is zero and a zero nominal interest rate on bonds is required to support the OQM
equilibrium, the consumption tax rate can (and with an optimising or merely sensible
government will) be dedicated to neutralising the e¤ects on the real economy (including
relative prices, cross-sectionally and over time) of any distortionary price indexation rule
that may be adopted by the constrained price setters in the Calvo model. If the nominal
4

interest rate on money can be set freely, the nominal interest rate on bonds can be used
to pursue and achieve the optimal rate of in‡ation of consumer and producer prices, even
with a constant indirect tax rate.
In the Calvo model, optimal policy requires that the actual in‡ation rate of producer
prices be equal to the core rate of producer price in‡ation generated by the indexation
rule of the constrained price setters.

The actual and core in‡ation rates will always

coincide if the indexation rule is rational and based on complete current information
- full indexation to the current period’s actual aggregate producer price level. The real
equilibrium (and welfare) will be independent of the rate of producer price in‡ation in this
case. With rational indexation based on partial current information, constrained price
setters implement full indexation to the rational expectation of the current period’s actual
producer price level. In this case the real equilibrium and welfare will be independent of
the expected rate of producer price in‡ation.
Even if the constrained price setters’indexation rule is arbitrary, as in Calvo’s original
model, which has constrained price setters keeping their nominal prices constant (zero indexation), or in Woodford’s model of partial, one-period-lagged indexation to the general
producer price level, the same real equilibrium achieved under full current indexation can
be achieved. What is required is that either interest rate policy or indirect tax policy
validate the core in‡ation rate of producer prices generated by the indexation rule as the
actual in‡ation rate of producer prices. If the nominal interest rate on money can be
chosen freely, the validation of the core in‡ation rate can be achieved with a constant
indirect tax rate, by using the nominal interest rate on bonds as the instrument.

If

the nominal interest rate on money is zero, the optimal in‡ation policy can be achieved
with a zero interest rate on bonds through the use of the indirect tax rate. Taking the
’microeconomic’, relative price e¤ects of production taxes and the consumption tax seriously and endowing the authorities with su¢ cient information, ‡exibility and sense to
use these …scal instruments e¤ectively, therefore leads to conclusions that are radically
di¤erent from those obtained by Woodford (see Woodford [41], especially Chapter 6).
5

Outside the cashless economy, zero in‡ation for the consumer price index never characterises optimal monetary policy when the nominal interest on money is constrained
to be zero.

Zero in‡ation for the producer price index only occurs as a ‡uke.

This

holds also for the Calvo model with the arbitrary indexation rule for which Woodford
establishes that a zero rate of in‡ation is optimal - partial, lagged price indexation. The
optimal rate of producer price in‡ation in the Calvo model equals the core in‡ation rate
- whatever that happens to be. Woodford’s partial lagged price indexation rule has zero
producer price in‡ation as the only constant optimal rate of producer price in‡ation.
Because he considers only a (log)linear approximation of the model at a zero in‡ation
non-stochastic steady state, he misses the non-constant optimal producer price in‡ation
process supported by his indexation rule.
For a zero rate of consumer price in‡ation to be the only possible in‡ation rate under
optimal monetary policy, each of the following conditions would have to hold:
(1) Either there is no money or the nominal interest rate on money can be set freely
to implement the OQM rule. This is practically unlikely unless the authorities can be
convinced to implement Gesell’s proposal for a carry tax on currency (see Gesell [28],
Goodfriend [29] and Buiter and Panigirtzoglou [12], [13]) or Eisner’s proposal for the
introduction of a virtual currency (see Eisler [23], Einaudi [22], Davies [20] and Buiter
[8]).
(2) The constrained price setters of the Calvo model implement an arbitrary price
indexation rule that supports only a zero producer price in‡ation rate in a non-stochastic
steady state. An example is Woodford’s partial, one-period lagged indexation rule.
(3) The authorities only target a constant rate of in‡ation. They do not use either
the short risk-free nominal interest rate on bonds (if the nominal interest rate on money
can be chosen freely) or their non-lump sum direct and indirect tax instruments (if the
nominal interest rate on money is constrained to equal zero) to implement policies that
make the real equilibrium in‡ation-neutral and the OQM rule optimal.
If the …rst condition holds and the authorities use their tax instruments and the nom6

inal interest rate on bonds optimally, a zero rate of consumer price in‡ation is consistent
with optimal monetary policy, but so is any other rate of consumer price in‡ation, for
any indexation rule, including Woodford’s.
Unlike Woodford’s analysis, this paper does not base the evaluation of the merits of
alternative in‡ation targets in a non-linear stochastic dynamic model with Calvo price
setting, on a log-linear approximation to that model at a deterministic steady state with
a zero rate of in‡ation. The results of this paper are global and the optimal in‡ation rate
of producer prices is not required to be constant.
For the suite of models considered in the paper, there are no robust welfare economic
foundations for price stability as an objective of monetary policy.

A formal model of the benchmark economy

2.1

The Private Sector

There is a continuum of households on the unit interval. Each household acts as a consumer, shopper, portfolio investor, money manager, worker-producer-supplier and price
setter.3 Depending on the activity under consideration, the household in what follows
can be referred to as ’producer’, ’consumer’, ’shopper’ or ’price setter’. Household j,
j 2 [0; 1] maximizes at t = 0; 1; 2; ::: the utility function given in (1).4 The expectation
operator conditional on information available at time t is Et : I assume that the information available to each agent is the same and can be summarised each period by a vector
of state variables

t:

The period sub-utility function for market consumption goods, u,

is increasing, strictly concave, twice continuously di¤erentiable and satis…es the Inada
conditions. The period sub-utility function for leisure, v; is non-decreasing and concave

This ’yeoman farmer’approach in which households produce and supply goods directly, and in which
only the potential labour time of household-producer j can be used in the production of consumption
good variety j; can easily be extended to include separate households and …rms and homogeneous or
heterogeneous labour markets.

When Calvo-type price contracts are considered, we should re-interpret the model as one in which
there is a continuum of di¤erentiated household-supplier types indexed by j; j 2 [0; 1] and a continuum
of identical household-suppliers of each type indexed by lj ; lj 2 [0; 1]:

There is a continuum of di¤erent varieties of the consumer goods on the unit interval.
Each type of household produces one variety. The amount of variety i consumed by
household j in period t is cjt (i): Each period, t; every household j is endowed with an
amount ejt > 0 of non-tradable perishable ’potential labour time’. The household can

for its product in period t depends on economy-wide real aggregate demand Yt (de…ned

Household j pays direct taxes and indirect taxes. Direct taxes are a lump-sum tax, Ttj
in nominal terms, and the proportional tax on the production of its market good. The
indirect tax is the proportional sales tax on all consumer spending.
The household has access to a complete set of time and state-contingent …nancial
markets. There also is money (cash or currency), an unbacked, irredeemable and inconvertible liability of the government. The quantity held at the end of period t by
household j is Mtj

0: A unit of currency held at the end of period t pays a risk-free

amount 1 + im

in price contracts. Households are subject to a cash-in-advance constraint on their purchases of market goods: a fraction

t (j)

in period t by other households from household j must be paid in cash; the remainder
is …nanced with ’trade credit’. The government is assumed not to be subject to a cashin-advance constraint. Leisure is not traded; it has to be consumed by the owner of the
10

endowment of potential leisure time. As regards the cash-in-advance constraint, leisure
therefore plays a role equivalent to a credit good. The nominal value of household j 0 s
portfolio of all non-monetary …nancial claims held at the end of period t is Ftj :6
I adopt the Lucas [33], [34] version of the timing of transactions. The unit period, t,
is partitioned into three distinct sub-periods, each of which contains one trading session.
All realisations of random variables during period t are known to the households and the
government before they take any period t actions. During the …rst sub-period, household
j trades securities, pays taxes, obtains (extends) trade credit to …nance the shares 1
t (i);

i 6= j of purchases (1

of sales) of market goods not …nanced with cash.

Household j brings total nominal …nancial wealth (monetary and non-monetary) Wtj to
the …rst sub-period. During this securities trading session, trades that require cash-inadvance cannot be made. The supplier of goods (the household as producer-supplier) is
the active money manager, as it is he who is, for one period, ’locked into’the money he
receives from the shoppers of the other families. A fraction

This does not include the one-period risk-free nominally denominated trade credit extended by
producers or the one-period risk-free nominally denominated consumption loans taken out by households
to …nance the shares of their sales or purchases of consumption goods that are not subject to the cashin-advance constraint.
7
One interpretation of sjt is shopping time (see e.g. Brock [4], and McCallum and Goodfriend [35]),
but the interpretation of sjt as representing the real resource cost of active cash management by the
producer, that is, shoe-leather costs in the spirit of Allais, Baumol and Tobin seems more apt here.

The government announces its taxes, public spending, money issuance and debt issuance for period t at the beginning of the period, before the securities markets open, and
pays interest and principal due on its outstanding stocks of debt instruments. In subperiod one, when the …nancial markets are open, each household acquires at least the
money balances they need to pay for the cash component of period t’s planned purchases
of market goods.

In addition to the transactions role attributed to the monetary …nancial instrument,
money is also assumed to be the numéraire. In the ‡exible price level model the choice
of numéraire has no implications for the behaviour of equilibrium real variables. When
there are nominal rigidities in price setting, that is, rigidities in terms of the numéraire,
the (bold) assumptions that (1) the monetary authorities determine the numéraire and
that (2) the monetary authorities can set the interest rate in terms of that numéraire,
are of great signi…cance for the real economy.9

The more common set of assumptions is that (1) the numéraire for price and wage contracts happens
to be the unit of the unique …nancial instrument that ful…lls the means of payment/medium of exchange
function (money) and (2) the state has the monopoly of the issuance of money and can …x the risk-free
interest rate in terms of money. The assumptions in the main text create a role for ’monetary policy’or
rather, nominal interest rate policy, also in an economy without a distinct monetary …nancial instrument
- a ’cashless’economy, (see Woodford [41]).

Aggregation and equilibrium

With identical tastes and complete markets for risk-sharing, di¤erences among individual
household behaviour occur for just two reasons: di¤erences in the present value of lifetime
resources and di¤erent realisations of the random endowment ejt : Leisure (a non-market
good) is separable in the period utility function from the consumption of market goods.
Shoe-leather inputs sjt are likewise ’e¤ectively’separable from the consumption of market
21

goods. Therefore, di¤erent realisations of ejt will not result in di¤erences among households j in their consumption of individual market goods, i, cjt (i); i 2 [0; 1] or in aggregate
consumption of market goods, Ctj ; provided the present value of net lifetime resources,
de…ned by the left-hand-side of equation (38), is the same for all agents.

behaviour of the real stock of money balances.

These restrictions will rule out most

de‡ationary bubble and liquidity trap solutions except those, like the OQM equilibrium,
where the nominal money stock goes to zero in the long run (see Buiter [7], [9] and Buiter
and Sibert [14]). This motivates the speci…cation of the rule governing the nominal money
stock when the opportunity cost of holding money balances is zero in equation (37).
As expected, the model with full price ‡exibility exhibits nominal indeterminacy:
only real output, real consumption, leisure, shoe leather inputs, real interest rates, real
money balances Mt =P~t , relative prices pt (j)=Pt and the in‡ation rates ~ t+1;t and

t+1;t

are

determinate. The nominal money stock, the general consumer and producer price levels
and the nominal values of the prices of the individual goods are indeterminate. With
exogenous risk-free nominal interest rates (or with any rules for the two nominal interest
rates that depend on real variables only), there is no nominal anchor.

If the government has access to unrestricted lump-sum taxes it needs either the aggregate consumption tax or a uniform production tax to implement a Pareto-e¢ cient
equilibrium. By setting the pecuniary opportunity cost of holding money equal to zero,
it reduces to zero the real resources used up as shoe-leather costs. It can then use either of the two taxes (or both in combination) to eliminate the distortions that drive
a wedge between the private opportunity cost of leisure and its social opportunity cost.
The private marginal cost of leisure is below the social marginal cost for two reasons.
First, because sales of the consumption good are partly paid for in cash which earns the
nominal risk-free interest rate on money, im
t+1;t ; rather than the nominal risk-free interest
rate on bonds, it+1;t ; it follows that, if it+t;t > im
t+1;t ; the implicit private opportunity cost
in terms of leisure foregone of consumption goods produced for the market by household
is below the social marginal cost. This ’Austrian’distortion exists even in the pure cash
goods and credit goods cash-in-advance model which does not have shoe-leather costs
( 0 (sjt ) = 0 ; 0
(if

sjt

ejt ; so sjt = 0;

= 1): Second, the household has monopoly power

< 1) in the market for the consumption good it produces and sells. The following

two propositions can be veri…ed by inspection of the equilibrium conditions (44) to (54):
Proposition 1 In the model with perfect price ‡exibility and an operative shoe-leather
mechanism ( 0 (sjt ) < 0) , a Pareto-e¢ cient equilibrium is supported by the following
policies:
it+1;t = im
t+1;t ; t
1
(1 + t ) [1 +

t (j)]

=

1

(56)

0

; j 2 [0; 1]; t

(57)

Proposition 2 In the model of Proposition 1, there is ’superneutrality of money’ or
in‡ation neutrality: any sequence of consumer and producer price in‡ation rates can be
26

optimal if the nominal interest rate on money can be chosen freely.
The interpretation of the e¢ ciency or social optimality conditions (56) and (57) is
straightforward. Equation (56) is the Bailey-Friedman optimal quantity of money (OQM)
rule which involves setting the pecuniary opportunity cost of holding real money balances
equal to zero. Since

1
(1+ t )[1+ t (j)]

=

< 1; equation (57) determines the optimal net

1

e¤ective subsidy to the consumption or production of market goods. Because the price
elasticities of demand for the consumption goods are all the same for all goods and
constant over time, the optimal subsidy rate is uniform and constant over time.
There is no optimal rate of in‡ation in the ‡exible price model or, more precisely, the
optimal monetary and …scal policies (those that support the command optimum), can be
achieved with any rate of in‡ation and any level of the risk-free nominal interest rate on
bonds. The OQM rule (56) only requires equality between the short risk-free nominal
interest rate on money and the short risk-free nominal interest rate on bonds. A unique
equilibrium rate of in‡ation is determined for any choice of it+1;t = im
t+1;t : Speci…cally,
a unique optimal rate of in‡ation is de…ned when im
t+1;t = 0: This requires it+1;t = 0
to support the command optimum, so the in‡ation rate under the optimal policy is
determined by equation (52) with it+1;t = 0.
Under the optimal monetary and …scal policy, the labour market and shoe leather
equilibrium conditions become

It follows that in the pure ’cash goods and credit goods’cash-in-advance model, the

the production tax (or by the two in combination), with the two short nominal interest
rates i and im set at arbitrary levels, subject only to it+1;t

im
t+1;t . The opposite is not

true: it is not possible to undo the e¤ect of monopoly simply by using the two nominal
interest rates. Since i

zero. While this eliminates the relative price distortion due to a positive opportunity cost
of holding money, even maximal use of the two nominal interest rates cannot overcome
the e¤ect of monopoly power.

Nominal prices set one period in advance

Assume that nominal prices have to be set one period ahead. Since by assumption the
pt (j) cannot be made contingent on the realisation of the state in period t; it follows that
Et 1 pt (j) = pt (j): As this applies to all prices, it also applies to the general producer price
level Pt ; whose period-t state-independent value is therefore known in period t

…rst-order conditions for the expected-utility maximising household-producer’s period t
price, pt (j) is given in equation (61). The …rst-order condition for the shoe-leather input
sjt is the same as in the ‡exible price model, given in equations (46a) and (46b), because
the value of sjt does not have to be set one period in advance.11

To achieve the …rst-best equilibrium,

commodity-speci…c taxes must be used to o¤set individual endowment shocks. The sales
tax

is restricted to be uniform across commodities. While it can address the common

monopoly power problem, it cannot both do this and neutralise the e¤ect of individual
endowment shocks.
When the government applies the OQM rule, every household j setting its price pt (j)
in period t 1 knows that in period t the government will set it+1;t im
t+1;t = 0: It therefore
knows in period t

1 that it will not incur any shoe-leather costs in period t; that is, it

knows that its optimal choice of shoe-leather input in period t will be sjt = 0:

use these taxes to undo both the planned (or expected) monopolistic over-pricing

If they have to be set unconditionally one period in advance, the optimal production

equalisation is achieved ’on average’:

Proposition 5 In the model with prices, interest rates and production and consumption
tax rates all set one period in advance, the optimal monetary and tax rate policies are the
same as in the model with ‡exible prices, interest rates and production and consumption
tax rates. If there is an operative shoe-leather mechanism ( 0 (sjt ) < 0) , a (constrained)
optimum is achieved by adopting the OQM rule (56) and the constant net e¤ective subsidy
rate given in (57).
Corollary 6 In the model with prices, interest rates and production and consumption tax
rates all set one period in advance, the optimal monetary and tax policies do not uniquely
determine the rate of in‡ation. Equilibrium in‡ation varies one-for-one with the level
of the short risk-free nominal interest rates, which can be set at any level if the interest
rate on money can be set at any level.

Calvo-style staggered overlapping price contracts

Consider the class of discrete-time Calvo-style overlapping staggered price setting models
considered in Woodford [41]. Each period a randomly selected constant fraction 1 !; 0 <
! < 1 of all household-suppliers has the opportunity to freely set the nominal price
of their product. The optimal price set by the ’free’ suppliers in period t is denoted
p^t (j): The remaining share ! of household-suppliers (the ’constrained’ suppliers) sets its
price according to a simple indexation rule.14
14

It is here that the interpretation, mentioned in footnote 2.1, of j as indexing household types,
j 2 [0; 1] and there being a continuum of identical household-suppliers indexed by lj of each type j; with
lj 2 [0; 1] is helpful in rationalising the expressions for the general price levels in equations (69) and (70)
below. A randomly chosen fraction 1 ! of households of each type j is able to set prices freely each
period.

32

The generic indexation rule for the nominal producer price of good j can be written
as:

pt (j) = pt 1 (j)

Optimal monetary policy with unrestricted optimal …scal
policy

If the authorities can freely set state-contingent and commodity-speci…c production tax
rates and state-dependent aggregate consumption tax rates, the …rst-best, Pareto-e¢ cient
equilibrium can be supported - the same command optimum that is supported when
prices are fully ‡exible. The e¤ect of Calvo-style staggered, overlapping price contracts
is neutralised by commodity-speci…c production taxes that equate the price charged by
the j th supplier in period k , pk (j); whenever pk (j) is di¤erent from p^k (j) (because the
supplier is locked into a pre-existing contract) to the price he would have charged had he
been able to set his price freely in period k; that is, p^k (j). They also correct the monopoly
distortion. Either the nominal interest rate on bonds or the consumption tax rate can then
be used to ensure that the relative prices faced by consumers are undistorted. Monetary
policy implements the OQM rule. By inspection of the equilibrium conditions, including
(73), the following proposition can be shown to hold:

Proposition 7 With Calvo-style staggered, overlapping price contracts and for all indexation functions

The rate of in‡ation of consumer prices, ~ t;t 1 ; is determined from the consumption
Euler equation (52). Under the optimal policies, all real variables, including aggregate
consumption, are independent of the rates of in‡ation of consumer and producer prices.
The consumption Euler equation therefore determines the rate of consumer price in‡ation,
~ t;t 1 ; which moves one-for-one, according to the Fisher condition, with the nominal
interest rate 1 + it;t 1 :
For a household-supplier j free to set his price in period t, the tax rule (74) implies

The full range of commodity-speci…c production tax rates will in general be needed
to implement (74), since p^t (j) depends on ejt : The uniform sales tax is redundant for
meeting the production e¢ ciency condition (74). The uniform sales tax is therefore
available, together with or instead of the nominal bond interest rate, to eliminate any
distortionary e¤ects of the indexation rule (that is, of core in‡ation) on relative prices
faced by consumers. Any indexation rule other than full current indexation to the price
level at factor cost -

t;t 1

=

t;t 1

- distorts the relative prices faced by consumers. It

follows that the optimal rate of in‡ation of producer prices is given by

t;t 1

=

t;t 1 :

It

is worth stating this as a separate proposition:
Proposition 8 In the Calvo model, the (unconstrained) optimal rate of producer price
in‡ation equals the core rate of producer price in‡ation:

36

t;t 1

=

(76)

t;t 1 :

The optimal rate of producer price in‡ation can be achieved through two mechanisms.
The …rst is the adoption by constrained price setters of rational indexation (or full, current
indexation), that is, pt (j) =

t;t 1 pt 1 (j)

for all constrained price setters j: In that case

any sequence of producer price in‡ation rates can be optimal: there is no inertia in
the core in‡ation process. The second mechanism is necessary to support the …rst-best
for any indexation rule other than full current indexation. For arbitrary core in‡ation
processes, including partial and/or lagged indexation, the authorities can use the interest
rate and/or the indirect tax rate to validate that core in‡ation process. Equations (75)
and (52) characterise the sequences of indirect tax rates

by varying the nominal interest rate on bonds, it+1;t ; or with any constant value of the
nominal interest rate on bonds it+1;t = i, by varying the indirect tax rate

I summarise

this discussion in two corollaries:
Corollary 9 With full current indexation (or rational indexation with full contemporaneous information), any rate of producer price in‡ation can be optimal.
Corollary 10 With arbitrary indexation rules, the optimal rate of producer price in‡ation (which validates the core in‡ation rate) will not be constant if core in‡ation is not
constant.
When the nominal interest rate on money is constrained to be constant, say iM
t+1;t = 0;
the OQM rule requires that it+1;t = 0; and the …rst-best can be achieved only with timevarying tax rates, unless 1 =

1 0
u (Ct )
Et [u0 (Ct+1 ) t;t+1 ]

for all t .

Proposition 7 also holds if, rather unreasonably, the producer price indexation rule is
a function of current, past and anticipated future rates of consumer price in‡ation only.
37

Consider, e.g. the case where

t;t 1

= ~ t;t 1 : Equation (75) then implies that the optimal

rates of producer and consumer price in‡ation are the same, that is,

Again, as with ‡exible prices and with price set one-period-in-advance, there is no
unique optimal in‡ation rate associated with the …rst-best equilibrium if the nominal
interest rate on money can be chosen freely. If the risk-free nominal interest rate on
money is constrained to equal zero, the optimal consumer price in‡ation rate is that
associated with a zero risk-free nominal interest rate on bonds. Unless there is full current
indexation, the indirect tax rate will have to be used to achieve the optimal producer
price in‡ation rate.

and the arguments that support or detract from their

plausibility, to determine whether the private price setting mechanism is itself producer
price in‡ation-neutral (given constant production and consumption tax rates and constant
nominal interest rates). Second, I check whether there are simple monetary and …scal
feedback rules that can neutralise any in‡ation non-neutralities in the private price setting
mechanism.
In what follows, I establish the two following propositions and o¤er arguments in
support of the view that the long-run equilibrium distribution of relative prices ought
not to depend on the indexation rule even for constant values of the nominal and …scal
policy instruments.

Proposition 11 Regardless of the speci…cation of the private indexation rule and the
associated core in‡ation process, the authorities can always use either the indirect tax
rate

t

or the nominal interest rate on bonds it+1;t according to the simple rules given by

(75) and (52), to eliminate any in‡uence of the in‡ation rates on the real equilibrium.
The uniform production subsidy given in (81) addresses e¢ ciency losses due to monopoly

Optimal monetary policy is then again de…ned by the OQM rule (56), even if the …scal

Proposition 12 If the nominal interest rate on money is constrained to equal zero, the
OQM rule requires it+1;t = 0 and the optimal rate of producer price in‡ation

The …scal rule (75) requires either that the constrained price setters use a full current

and are able to observe the variables included in the private sector’s indexation rule. It
is not necessary for the authorities to know, when they make the credible announcement
(in period t or earlier) of the tax rule (75) for period t, the values of all the variables
(dated period t or earlier) required to implement the period t tax rule (that is, to send
out the tax bill or the subsidy refund). It is only necessary that the authorities have this
information in period t or at some later time.

Any payments from the private sector

to the public sector (or vice versa) associated with the tax rule can be delayed until the
required information (the realisations of the arguments in the rule) has become known
to and veri…able by both parties involved in the tax or subsidy payment. As long as the
present value of the payments does not depend on their timing (and they will not in the
complete markets framework assumed here), the tax rules will have their intended e¤ect
even if the public sector were to observe aggregate variables later than the private sector
- itself an unlikely scenario.

From (84) it is clear that the tax rule cannot achieve full productive e¢ ciency, since

of the distribution of the relative prices set by free price setters is the same as in the
unconstrained optimal equilibrium.
Under this optimal monetary policy and constrained …scal policy combination, which
can be implemented for with any indexation rule, the rate of in‡ation of the consumer
price index is again indeterminate if the nominal interest rate on money can be chosen
freely, because in that case the common risk-free nominal interest rates on bonds and
money can be chosen freely.

5.3

What indexation rule?

The indexation rules

k;t

considered in what follows (and indeed the entire Calvo-class

of price setting models) are ad-hoc, in the sense of not being derived as decision rules of
purposefully acting agents starting from acceptable primitive assumptions (tastes, technology, endowments, information, contract enforcement institutions). Nevertheless, certain restrictions on permissible indexation rules can reasonably be imposed. One way
to ’stress test’ an ad-hoc indexation rule is to evaluate its performance in very simple,
42

well-understood environments.

As this paper investigates which in‡ation target (not

necessarily constant) would be justi…able on utilitarian welfare-economic grounds, the indexation rule should be able to support more than one constant rate of in‡ation (indeed
a non-trivial range of in‡ation rates) in a deterministic steady state. In this deterministic
steady-state benchmark, all sources of uncertainty, other than the random allocation of
suppliers to the free and constrained groups, are abstracted from and government spending Gt , individual endowments ejt ; the consumption tax rate

and output tax rates

are constant:17 There are complete markets for trading the risk associated with the

random assignment of suppliers each period to the free and constrained groups.
5.3.1

Woodford’s indexation rule

The indexation rule proposed by Woodford [41], which plays a central role in his argument
for price stability (zero in‡ation) as the appropriate target for monetary policy, is given
in equation (86). It applies to all suppliers that are not free to choose their optimal price
p^t :

pt (j) = pt 1 (j)

Pt
Pt

Woodford’s model has a uniform production subsidy that eliminates ine¢ ciencies due
to the existence of monopoly power.
Using the notation of (66),

Under this indexation rule, the relative price of good j for constrained suppliers evolves
according to:

This can easily be extended to steady states with a constant growth rate of the endowments and of
GDP.

It is clear that this indexation rule (86), although it respects the ’homogeneity postulate’, is a most unfortunate choice as the maintained hypothesis in an analysis of the
welfare consequences of alternative in‡ation targets. Unless

T 1: For instance, with a positive, constant rate of in‡ation and over-indexing

( > 1); a constrained price setter’s relative price will be rising over time for as long
44

as he remains constrained. It will also be above-average cross-sectionally, forcing the
relative prices of the free price setters to be below-average.

If

< 1; the price setter

would be systematically and persistently ’under-indexed’, with his relative price declining
exponentially to zero for as long as he is not free to set his price:
The indexation rule (86) therefore ought to be rejected because it implies unreasonable, indeed irrational, behaviour by constrained price setters in simple, well-understood
environments in which over-indexing or under-indexing cannot be rationalised with an
appeal to signal extraction, risk sharing or impaired learning ability. Even the mildest
version of the Lucas critique would imply that the indexation rule in (86) would not
survive (unless

= 1) if the …rm that adopted it were operating in an environment with

a constant but non-zero rate of in‡ation. If the …rm stuck to the indexation rule, the
…rm would be unlikely to survive.
In an impartial analysis of in‡ation targeting, it is especially important that the dice
not be loaded in favour of any particular rate of in‡ation, say zero, through the imposition of an arbitrary restriction on the indexation rule which (1) precludes the existence
of a deterministic steady state with any non-zero rate of in‡ation, and (2) implies, when
there is a constant but non-zero rate of producer price in‡ation, highly implausible con…gurations of relative prices over time and cross-sectionally, and a persistent (indeed
permanent) inability to learn by private price setters.
Of course, even when

6= 1; the implementation of simple rules for the nominal

interest rate and/or the indirect tax rate (75) will make the price setting mechanism
in‡ation-neutral. Under (75), it will always be the case that producer price in‡ation satis…es

t; t 1

=

t 1;t 2 :

Consumer price in‡ation is then given by ~ t;t

1

1+ t
1+ t 1

t 1;t 2 :

Thus, regardless of whether Woodford’s indexation rule is dropped and replaced by something more sensible or kept and neutralised or validated by a simple indirect tax rule or
nominal interest rate rule, price stability (of either the consumer price level or the producer price level) is neither necessary nor su¢ cient for monetary policy to be optimal.
When the nominal interest rate on money is constrained to be zero, consumer price
45

stability is inconsistent with optimal monetary policy, except in a cashless economy.
5.3.2

Ad-hoc indexation rules that permit steady states with non-zero in‡ation rates

This formulation includes as special cases both Calvo’s original model, where a constant nominal price is maintained by the constrained suppliers ( =

As I am only interested in economic systems that can

support, in the deterministic special case, steady states with more than one constant rate
of in‡ation, I will concentrate on the case where

The indexation rule given in (89) is also subject to the Lucas critique. Unless either
the core in‡ation process is validated (

t;t 1

=(

t 1;t 2 )

1

); or

= 1 and

= 0; the

relative price of good j; pt (j)=Pt will be subject to ine¢ cient cross-sectional and timeseries variation. Any constant aggregate rate of in‡ation would keep the relative price of
good j constant. For instance, when

This implies a systematic and persistent decline in the relative price of

This can easily be generalised to an autoregressive-moving average process like A(L) t;t 1 =
B(L) t;t 1 where A(L) and B(L) are polynominal distributed lag functions with A(1) 1 B(1) = 1:

46

constrained suppliers if the economy-wide rate of in‡ation were rising systematically and
persistently, if

> 0: The indexation rule (89) therefore only makes sense if there is no

signi…cant trend (positive or negative) in the rate of in‡ation.
A possible attractive generalisation of (89) would be along the lines of John Flemming’s ’gearing hypothesis’(see Flemming [24]). Flemming’s hypothesis, proposed as a
theory of in‡ation expectation formation rather than as a theory of indexation rules, held
that as long as the price level was stationary, a simple, ad-hoc forecasting rule (indexation
rule for our purposes) relating the predicted price level to past realisations of the price
level (subject to a homogeneity constraint) would be adopted. For indexation rules that
only use aggregate information from the current and most recent past period, we would,
when the aggregate price level is stationary, have a rule like:

pt (j) = Pt1 Pt 1 :
If a trend were to appear in the price level but not in the rate of in‡ation (if the price level
were to become non-stationary but the rate of in‡ation remained stationary), forecasts
would ’shift up a gear’(because learning takes place) and a forecasting rule relating the
forecast of the in‡ation rate to the past behaviour of the in‡ation rate would be adopted.
The indexation rule (89) is an example. If the in‡ation rate became non-stationary but
the change in the rate of in‡ation remained stationary, the forecasting rule would again
shift up a gear. The indexation rule would become:
t;t 1 (j)
t 1;t 2 (j)

1

=

t;t 1

t 1;t 2

t 1;t 2

t 2;t 3

A statistical description of Flemming’s gearing hypothesis as applied to indexation
rules would be that the economy-wide in‡ation rate and the supplier’s in‡ation rate generated by the indexation rule are ’co-integrated’. The indexation rule (or the in‡ation
expectation formation process), without meeting the full-‡edged model-consistency requirement of the Lucas critique, does meet the less demanding, but possibly more relevant,
47

requirement that it should not be ’o¤’by an order of integration or more.
With constant indirect tax rates, the indexation rule (89) makes the real equilibrium
invariant to any constant in‡ation rate of producer prices if

= 1

: It makes the

real equilibrium invariant to any rate of in‡ation, constant or not, if in addition
the case of full current indexation. Regardless of the values of

=1-

and ; implementation

of the …scal rule (75) and/or appropriate use of the nominal interest rate will make the
real equilibrium invariant under alternative in‡ation rates, by validating core in‡ation:

Full current indexation

As noted in Woodford [41], pp. 214-215, all in‡ation inertia vanishes (with constant
values of all policy instruments) in Calvo-type models with full current indexation. This
corresponds to the case

= 1 and

= 0 in equation (89).

With zero production and consumption tax rates, there remain three distortions when
monetary policy is exogenous: (1) monopoly power; (2) insu¢ cient relative price ‡exibility, which prevents constrained suppliers from responding with their prices to idiosyncratic shocks to their endowment; (3) a non-zero opportunity cost of holding money
balances (when i > im ). Since the real equilibrium under full current indexation is independent of the rate of in‡ation, optimal monetary can be dedicated to implementing the
OQM rule.
5.3.4

Full current indexation as relative price contracting

The fact that, in period t; the price instrument of supplier j is the price of good j in terms
of period t money, pt (j); does not mean that supplier j is unaware that it is the relative
price of good j; pt (j)=Pt ; rather than its nominal price, that determines the demand for
his product . Nominal price setting, and the nominal inertia that may result from it are
not money illusion.

Since it is the relative price of good j that matters to supplier j

, a price indexation rule for supplier j could be plausibly argued to be a relative price
48

contracting rule, that is, a rule that is motivated by a desire to achieve an acceptable
or reasonable value for this relative price during the periods that supplier j is not free
to set the relative price of his product. As a simple example consider the relative price
contracting rule given in (90), which mimics the nominal price indexation rule in (89):
pt (j)
pt 1 (j)
=
Pt
Pt 1

pt (j)=Pt
pt 1 (j)=Pt

pt 1 (j)=Pt
pt 2 (j)=Pt

:

(90)

It can be rewritten as a nominal price indexation rule:

pt (j) = pt 1 (j)

t;t 1 (j)

where

=

t;t 1 (j)

t 1;t 2 (j)

t;t 1

t 1;t 2

t;t 1

:

The full current indexation rule for the nominal producer price is the special case
of this relative price contracting rule (90) when

=

= 0: It can be contrasted with

Calvo’s original speci…cation in which a nominal price freely set in period t has to be
kept constant until the next random opportunity for changing that price ( =

= 0 in

equation (89)) - a model of staggered overlapping nominal price setting similar in spirit
and in many of its key properties to Taylor’s model of staggered, overlapping two-period
nominal wage contracts (Taylor [40]).
The natural interpretation of Calvo’s nominal price setting model with full indexation
( = 1;

= 0 in equation (89)) is that household j, when it is among the randomly

selected households whose price contracts can be altered in period t; sets a constant
relative price for good j in terms of the composite consumption good, to remain in
e¤ect until the next random opportunity for changing this relative price comes along.
This relative price setting model is in the spirit of Buiter and Jewitt [10], and Buiter
and Miller [11].

Buiter and Jewitt [10] extended Taylor’s [40] analysis of staggered

49

overlapping nominal wage contracts (motivated with a concern by workers for relative
money wages) by developing and analysing a model of staggered overlapping real wage
contracts (motivated with a concern by workers for relative real wages). Buiter and Miller
[11] developed a continuous time version of a Calvo-type model in which new contracts
…x (until the next random opportunity for re-contracting) not the nominal value of the
contract price but the proportional rate of change of the nominal contract price.
An even closer approximation to the key properties of the Buiter and Jewitt and Buiter
and Miller models would be to take the
relative price benchmark one period:

=

pt (j)
Pt 1

=

= 0 version of equation (90) and to lag the
pt 1 (j)
.
Pt 2

This can be written as a nominal

price indexation rule with full but one-period-lagged indexation: pt (j) = pt 1 (j)
which is also the special case of (89) with

= 0 and

t 1;t 2 ,

= 1: The resulting model, like

the Buiter-Miller model and the 2-period version of the Buiter-Jewitt model, is in all
relevant respects the same as the Calvo model with full one-period lagged indexation
considered by Christiano et. al.[18], Smets and Wouters [37] and Woodford [41].19 . They
generate in‡ation inertia and not just price level inertia when the commodity tax rates are
constant.20 The real equilibrium of these models is invariant under alternative constant
rates of in‡ation.
The full current indexation rule assumes that the period t constrained price setters
index fully to the actual realisation of the period t aggregate price level.

A slightly

See also Buiter [5] for an open economy version of the Buiter-Miller in‡ation inertia model and Buiter
[6] for an analysis of optimal disin‡ation policies and the case for gradualism in the Buiter-Miller Model.
20
As pointed out in Buiter and Jewitt [10], the price level equation generated by the N-period staggered
overlapping relative money wage contract is an ARIMA(N-1, N-1) process, while the price level generated
by the N-period staggered, overlapping relative real wage process is an ARIMA (2N-2, 2N-2) process.
When N=2, this means that the relative money wage model has price level inertia (an ARIMA (1,1)
process) but not in‡ation inertia, while the relative real wage model has in‡ation persistence (an ARIMA
(2,2) process. Of course, the relative money wage process with N=3 also generates an ARIMA (2,2)
process for the price level. Unless one knows N a-priori, there is an observationally equivalent relative
money wage model for every relative wage model. For some reason, the empirical literature seems to
be stuck on the N-2 case. With yearly contracts this may make sense if the unit period of analysis
and measurement is a year. However, if the true length of the typical (US) wage contract is 2 years,
but contracts are negotiated every quarter and the distribution of contract renewals is uniform over the
year, then, taking the quarter to be the unit period, N=8. The relative money wage model would imply
an ARIMA(7,7) for the general price level (using quarterly data) and the relative real wage money an
ARIMA(12,12) process. Plenty of in‡ation persistence therefore from both models and, I would think,
a di¢ cult task of discriminating between them using, say, 160 or 200 quarterly observations.

Conclusion

I have analysed the in‡ation rate associated with optimal monetary policy and either
optimal or constrained but supportive tax policy in a suite of models that are in the
modern mainstream of dynamic stochastic (mostly) optimising macroeconomic general
equilibrium tradition.

The implications of the analysis are clear. In all models (‡exi-

ble prices, one-period-ahead nominal price setting and Calvo-style staggered overlapping
price setting with any kind of indexation rule for the constrained price setters), the optimal monetary policy is given by the ’Optimal Quantity of Money’rule, that the …nancial
opportunity cost of holding money must be equal to zero. If the nominal interest rate on
money can be set freely by the authorities, there is no unique consumer price in‡ation
rate associated with the optimal monetary rule. By varying the risk-free nominal interest
rate on bonds (while keeping it equal to the risk-free nominal interest rate on money),
any sequence of consumer price in‡ation rates, positive or negative, can be supported by
an optimal monetary policy. With an exogenously given zero nominal interest rate on
money, the consumer price in‡ation rate associated with the optimal monetary policy is
the consumer price in‡ation rate supported by a zero risk-free nominal interest rate on
bonds. In a deterministic steady state that would be a negative consumer price in‡ation
rate equal to minus the rate of time preference.
51

The most striking result is that the OQM rule characterises optimal monetary policy
(except, of course, in a cashless economy) when there are Calvo-style price contracts,
regardless of the indexation rule adopted by constrained price setters. It holds, for instance, for the lagged partial indexation rule that plays such a key role in Woodford’s
case for price stability as the target of monetary policy. When the nominal interest rate
on money can be set freely, the OQM rule is optimal even if the indirect tax rate is kept
constant. For the OQM rule to be optimal when the nominal interest rate on money
is constrained to be zero, one either needs well-posed private indexation rules (such full
current indexation with and either complete or partial information), or the adoption by
the authorities of a simple feedback rule for the indirect tax rate. By validating the core
in‡ation process, the real equilibrium becomes in‡ation-neutral even if the private price
indexation rules are ill-posed and arbitrary. Optimal producer price in‡ation will not be
constant unless core in‡ation is constant.
Woodford ([41]) analysed models similar to those used in this paper. After considering
the Calvo price setting model with a number of indexation rules, he reaches to following
conclusion, which is starkly di¤erent from that of this paper: "Thus aggregate price
stability is a su¢ cient condition for the absence of price dispersion in the present simple
framework" (p. 405). "At the same time, in most cases, it is also a necessary condition"
(p. 405); and: "...in a model with staggered pricing and full indexation to a lagged price
index, price stability is not necessary for the absence of price dispersion; it is simply
necessary that the in‡ation rate be constant over time. But again this is a highly special
case. If the indexation parameter

takes any value other than one, only zero in‡ation

is consistent with an absence of price dispersion". (p. 406).
To be correct, the last part of the last sentence of this quote should be "..., zero
in‡ation is the only constant rate of in‡ation consistent with an absence of suboptimal
price dispersion".
Woodford recognises further on (in Chapter 6 of Woodford [41]), that his analysis of
the relationship between relative price dispersion and the aggregate in‡ation rate only
52

implies that zero in‡ation should be the objective of monetary policy if there are no
shoe-leather and Austrian (cash-good vs. credit good) distortions in the economy. Even
if monetary distortions are absent, the results of this paper are di¤erent from those of
Woodford. There are two reasons for this, each of which is su¢ cient to invalidate the
proposition that, in the class of models under consideration, price stability is necessary
or su¢ cient for optimality. First, the lagged partial indexation rule for which Woodford
establishes that zero in‡ation is necessary for optimality is implausible and inappropriate
for an analysis of how the economy would perform under alternative constant in‡ation
targets. With partial indexation and constant indirect taxes, there can be no constant
in‡ation rate other than zero in a deterministic steady state. The relative price anomalies,
cross-sectionally and over time, that result from this arbitrary indexation rule under any
non-zero constant rate of in‡ation, would lead even the most cerebrally challenged price
setter to abandon the Woodford indexation function as he learned about the relationship
between his indexation rule and the behaviour of his relative price.
The simplest plausible alternative to the Calvo pricing model with Woodford’s indexation function is the natural modi…cation of the pure Calvo model that assumes that free
price setters choose not a …xed nominal price but a …xed relative price until their next
random opportunity for setting the relative price freely. Individual money prices then
adjust in line with the aggregate producer price level to maintain this relative price until
the next free pricing opportunity. In this model, there is full current indexation and the
real equilibrium is independent of the rate of in‡ation. Reasonable alternative relative
price indexation rules result in the real equilibrium being invariant under alternative fully
anticipated in‡ation sequences or under alternative constant in‡ation rates.
The second reason the results of this paper di¤er from those of Woodford hold for
any price indexation rule, including Woodford’s.

I assume that the authorities are

capable of implementing a very simple nominal interest rate rule and/or a very simple
feedback rule for the indirect tax rate. Under this rule, the producer price core in‡ation
process is validated by policy and any in‡ation non-neutralities in the private price setting
53

mechanism are neutralised. The OQM rule is optimal under any price indexation rule if
the nominal interest rate and/or the indirect tax rate can be used responsively in this way.
Woodford implicitly assumes either that interest rate-setting and tax-setting authorities
are completely unresponsive to aggregate information that is readily available or that
they can only target a constant rate of in‡ation.
This paper does not argue that there are no valid arguments in favour of price stability
(de…ned as zero in‡ation for some appropriate aggregate price or cost-of-living index) as
an objective, or even the overriding objective, of monetary policy. All it says is that in
the canonical suite of models considered in the paper, price stability is not a property
of optimal monetary policy if either the private price setters are capable of learning or
the tax authorities are capable of implementing a simple feedback rule for the nominal
interest rate and/or the indirect tax rate.
The result of this paper that optimal monetary policy should implement the Optimal
Quantity of Money rule is not robust to two important extensions. The …rst is the
introduction of constraints on the ability of the authorities to impose lump-sum taxes
or make lump-sum transfers. With such constraints, seigniorage revenues, that is, the
real resources appropriated by the authorities through the issuance of base money, can
become a valuable source of revenue for the authorities. When the interest rate on money
is zero, this may raise the in‡ation rate associated with optimal monetary policy.21
The second extension is menu costs, that is, the explicit consideration of the real
resource costs associated with changing prices or renegotiating price contracts, as in the
papers of Caplin and Spulber [16] and Caplin and Leahy [17]. Such menu costs should be
interpreted broadly to include the time, e¤ort and inconvenience of measuring, computing
and calculating with an inconvenient yardstick whose length varies from period to period.
21

For seigniorage (or the anticipated in‡ation tax on base money) to matter, we also have to impose
constraints on the ability of the authorities to raise distortionary tax rates. Without this, all the
government’s current and future revenue needs could be satis…ed in the initial period through what
amounts to a capital levy. If any non-monetary nominal debt is outstanding, it may also be necessary
to impose a limit on the government’s ability to in‡ict capital losses on the private owners of nominal
public debt through an unanticipated jump in the initial price level.

54

The implications of menu costs for the optimal rate of in‡ation depend crucially on the
details of how menu costs are modeled. It makes a di¤erence whether a real sunk cost is
incurred every time a nominal price is changed, or only when a new contract (which may
involve indexation clauses) is negotiated. Nominal price changes that are the result of the
mechanical implementation of an invariant indexation rule may have lower menu costs
than those that are the result of bargaining between buyers and sellers or the outcome
of an auction. If menu costs are assumed to be particularly important for the goods and
services that make up the cost-of-living index, this would drive the optimal in‡ation rate
of the cost of living index closer to zero.

If, as seems more plausible, menu costs are

especially important for money wages (negotiating and bargaining over wages, whether
bilaterally or through organised labour unions and/or employers’ associations is costly
and time-consuming), a zero rate of money wage in‡ation would be a natural focal point
of monetary policy. With positive labour productivity growth, zero wage in‡ation would
imply a negative rate of in‡ation for the cost of living, consumer and producer price
indices.
Finally, a re‡ection on the limitations - the tameness - of the standard suite of models
considered in this paper and on their usefulness as a guide for monetary and …scal policy
in times of recession and macroeconomic instability. All the distortions in the economy
are ’Harberger Triangles’rather than ’Okun Gap’distortions. Monopoly power and the
ine¢ ciencies associated with a non-zero …nancial opportunity cost of holding money are
standard micro fare. The distortions caused by nominal price rigidities are a sub-optimal
degree of relative price dispersion; formal or informal price indexation rules that do not
su¤er from persistent, indeed permanent, in‡ation non-neutrality make these distortions
disappear, perhaps gradually, if learning takes place. If the private price setting mechanism su¤ers from persistent in‡ation non-neutralities, minor tinkering with the interest
rate and/or the aggregate indirect tax rate will make these distortions disappear. It all
looks like rather small beer. Does any central banker lie awake worrying about a suboptimal degree of relative price dispersion among monopolistically competitive industries?
55

Should they? It is hard to discern anything that resembles a failure of e¤ective demand
or hints at crises. This is hardly the stu¤ of Great Depressions, severe or even regular
recessions. Is it time to stop hanging ever more small rigidities, frictions, ad-hoc behavioural regularities and other New-Keynesian ornaments on the old dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium Christmas tree, and to try for something radically new?
