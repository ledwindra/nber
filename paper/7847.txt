Introduction

This paper is a statistical analysis of the manner in which the Federal Reserve System (the
Fed) determines the level of short-term interest rates in the U.S. In particular, we study
when and how the Fed decides to change the level of the Federal funds rate target, one of
the most publicized and anticipated indicators for Þnancial markets all over the world. The
target (for short) is an internal objective that is unilaterally set by the Chairman of the
Federal Reserve System in compliance with the directives agreed upon at the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. The target is used by the Trading Desk of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York as a guide for the daily conduct of open market operations. We
believe the target is of considerable economic interest precisely because it is not the outcome
of the interaction of supply and demand of Federal funds and it is not subject to technical
ßuctuations or extraneous sources of noise. Rather, it is an operational indicator of how the
direction of monetary policy determined by the FOMC is translated into practice.
Often a long period goes by before there is any change in the target. When the target
is changed, it is usually in discrete increments of 25 basis points.

Forecasting the target

thus requires a dynamic model for limited dependent variables. One approach is simply to
use a conventional logit or probit model and assume that all of the relevant conditioning
variables are included; see for example Dueker’s (1999b) very useful study.

The draw-

back is that signiÞcant serial correlation is likely to characterize the latent residuals. The
dynamic probit speciÞcation (Eichengreen, Watson, and Grossman, 1985; Davutyan and
Parke, 1995) is one way to deal with this, but has the drawback of requiring diﬃcult nu1

merical integrations. Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations (McCulloch and Rossi, 1994)
and importance-sampling simulation estimators (Lee, 1999) are promising alternative estimation strategies.

In particular, Cargnoni, Müller, and West (1997) proposed modeling

the conditional probabilities as a nonlinear transformation of a latent Gaussian process, and
simulated the Bayesian posterior distribution using a combination of the Gibbs sampler and
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Fahrmeir (1992, 1994) and Lunde and Timmermann (2000)
suggested a latent process for time-varying coeﬃcients and also used numerical Bayesian
methods for inference.

Dueker (1999a) employed a latent Markov-switching process to

model serial dependence in volatility, again analyzed with numerical Bayesian methods. Piazzesi (2000) proposed a linear-quadratic jump diﬀusion representation, though the technical
demands for estimation of the latent continuous-time process from discretely sampled data
are considerable.
In any of these numerically intensive methods, the ultimate object of interest is typically
to form a forecast of the discrete event conditional on a set of available information, and
this forecast will be some nonlinear function of the information.

A logical shortcut is to

hypothesize a data-generating process for which this nonlinear function is a primitive element
rather than the outcome of millions of computations. The question is how to aggregate past
realizations in a way that reduces the dimensionality of the problem but still could reasonably
be expected to summarize the dynamics.
The autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model of Engle and Russell (1997, 1998)
and Engle (2000) seems a very sensible approach for doing this. In the ACD speciÞcation,

2

the forecast of the length of time between events is taken to be a linear distributed lag
on previous observed durations; for the ACD(1,1) model, the forecast duration is simply
exponential smoothing applied to past durations.

Although this seems a very promising

way to model the serial dependence in discrete-valued time series, it is not clear how one
should update such a forecast on the basis of information that has arrived since the most
recent target change.
Engle and Russell’s ACD speciÞcation poses the question, How much time is expected
to pass before the next event (e.g., target change) occurs? Here we reframe the question as,
How likely is it that the target will change tomorrow, given all that is known today? We
describe this framework as the autoregressive conditional hazard (ACH) model.
Our proposed ACH framework is introduced in Section 2.

This class of time-series

processes includes as a special case a discrete-time version of the ACD framework. Section
3 develops the formal connection between the ACH and ACD speciÞcation of the likelihood
function. Our ACH speciÞcation has the advantage over the ACD model that it readily
allows one to incorporate updated explanatory variables in addition to lagged target changes
in order to form a forecast of whether the Fed is likely to change the target again soon.
Section 4 shows how this framework can be used to forecast the level of the Fed funds
target, which requires predicting not only whether a change will occur but also the magnitude
and direction of the change. We suggest that, conditional on a change in the target, one
can use an ordered probit model to describe the size of the change.
Section 5 discusses the institutional background for the target, which motivates several

3

details of the particular speciÞcation used in the empirical results presented in Section 6.
The forecasting performance of these ACH estimates is evaluated in Section 7. The dynamics
of the Fed funds target described by our model are then used in a policy analysis exercise
described in Section 8. Section 9 concludes.

2

The Autoregressive Conditional Hazard Model

The autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model of Engle and Russell (1998) describes
the average interval of time between events. Let ũi denote the length of time between the
ith and the (i + 1)th time the Fed changed the target, and let ψ̃ i denote the expectation of
ũi given past observations ũi−1 , ũi−2 , .... The ACD(m, r) model posits that1
ψ̃ i = ω +

m
X

αj ũi−j +

j=1

r
X

β j ψ̃ i−j .

(1)

j=1

Engle and Russell show that the resulting process for durations ũi , when indexed by the
cumulative number of target changes i, admits an ARMA(max{m, r}, r) representation with
the jth autoregressive coeﬃcient given by αj + β j . Thus stationarity requires
Pr

j=1

β j < 1.

Pm

j=1

αj +

The basic premise of our approach is that observations on the process only occur at

discrete points in time. Although one could use our method with daily data, little is lost by
analyzing the funds rate target changes on a weekly frequency for the institutional reasons
given in Section 5 below. DeÞne xt to be a random variable that takes on the value of unity
1

Dufour and Engle (1999) have recently suggested some nonlinear generalizations of the ACD for which
it would be interesting to explore the ACH analogs.

if the Fed changes the target rate during week t and zero otherwise.

Our Þrst task is to

rewrite expression (1) so that it is indexed by calendar time t rather than by a count of the
cumulative number of target changes i. Let {w1t } t = 1, 2, ..., T be a sequence that, for any
date t, records the date of the most recent change in the target as of week t:

w1t = txt + (1 − xt )w1,t−1

for t = 1, 2, ..., T

(2)

so that w1t = t if the target changes on date t, and w1τ stays at t for subsequent weeks τ
until a new target change. Let w2t denote the week of the target change before that:

w2t = xt w1,t−1 + (1 − xt )w2,t−1

for t = 1, 2, ..., T

so that w2t = w1,t−1 if the target changes on date t and w2τ stays at w2,t−1 for subsequent
weeks τ until a new target change. In general let wjt be the date of the j th most recent
target as of date t:

wjt = xt wj−1,t−1 + (1 − xt )wj,t−1
for j = 2, 3, .... Thus, in this notation, w1,t−1 − w2,t−1 would correspond to the length of the
most recent duration ũi that has been completed prior to date t. Let ψ t denote the expected
length of time separating the date of the most recent target change prior to date t from the
subsequent target change; that is, ψ t corresponds to the value of ψ̃ i that is associated with
calendar date t. In calendar time, expression (1) would then be written
ψt = ω +

m
X
j=1

αj (wj,t−1 − wj+1,t−1 ) +
5

r
X
j=1

β j ψ wj,t−1 .

(3)

Notice that expression (3) is a step function that only changes when a new event was observed
the preceding week, i.e., only when xt−1 = 1.
Next consider the hazard rate ht , which is deÞned as the conditional probability of a
change in the target given Υt−1 , which represents information observed as of time t − 1:

ht = P (xt = 1|Υt−1 ).

(4)

If the only information contained in Υt−1 were the dates of previous target changes, the
hazard rate would not change until the next target change. In this case, one could calculate
the expected length of time until the next target change as
∞
X
j=1

j(1 − ht )j−1 ht = 1/ht

and thus the hazard rate that is implied by the ACD model (1) is
ht = 1/ψ t .

(5)

We assume that the time interval is chosen to be suﬃciently short so that no observed
duration is ever less than one period. Hence the expected duration ψ t cannot be smaller
than unity and ht must be between zero and one. In the ACD speciÞcation, a value of ψ t
less than unity would be a suboptimal forecast, but would not pose any numerical problems
for evaluating the likelihood function. By contrast, if one uses (5) to evaluate the likelihood
function in terms of calendar time, it will be necessary to impose ψ t > 1 to ensure numerical
viability of the algorithm.

6

The obvious advantage of describing the process in terms of calendar time and the hazard
rate rather than in terms of event indexes and expected durations is that new information
that appeared since the previous target change may also be relevant for predicting the timing
of the next target change. A natural generalization of expression (5) is
ht =

1
ψ t + δ 0 zt−1

(6)

where zt−1 denotes a vector of variables that is known at time t − 1.
For reasons that will shortly become clear, we assume that the Þrst element of zt−1 is a
constant and normalize δ 1 relative to unity and likewise normalize ω to zero. SpeciÞcally,
we work with a diﬀerence equation of the form of (3) without the constant term ω:
qt =

m
X
j=1

αj (wj,t−1 − wj+1,t−1 ) +

r
X

β j qwj,t−1 .

(7)

j=1

Notice that since the constant term ω has been dropped from (7), the unconditional expectation of qt will not be u, the expected interval between target changes, but will instead
be

Pm
j=1 αj u
P
q=
.
1 − rj=1 β j

(8)

Hence the natural values to start up the recursion (7) would be
qt = q

for t = 0, −1, ...

wj0 − wj+1,0 = u

for j = 1, ...m.

(9)
(10)

For empirical estimation we take u equal to the average observed duration and calculate q
from (8). The hazard for observation t is then obtained by iterating on (7) starting from
7

(9) and (10) and then calculating
ht =

1
.
1 + qt + δ 0 zt−1

(11)

It might appear from the unit coeﬃcient on qt in the denominator of (11) that this approach imposes a particular scale relation between durations ui and hazard rates ht . However, this is not the case. For example, if one solves (7) for m = r = 1 and substitutes the
result into (11), the hazard can be written as
ht =

1
0

1 + δ zt−1 + αũt

where ũt is a weighted average of past durations:
ũt = (w1,t−1 − w2,t−1 ) + β(w2,t−1 − w3,t−1 ) + β 2 (w3,t−1 − w4,t−1 ) + ...
+β τ t −1 (wτ t,t−1 − wτ t +1,t−1 ) + β τ t u + β τ t +1 u/(1 − β)
for τ t + 1 the cumulative number of target changes that have been observed as of date t.
Hence α is eﬀectively a free parameter for translating from units of durations into a hazard
rate.
Let vt = qt + δ 0 zt−1 and notice that an important numerical objective is to ensure that
vt is always positive. One way to do this is would be simply to replace vt by 0 whenever
vt is negative. This has the drawback that the resulting function h(vt ) is nondiﬀerentiable
at vt = 0, which could present problems for numerical optimization routines. We have had
success using the following sigmoidal function to paste between negative and positive values

8

of vt while maintaining continuous derivatives:

 0.0001 + vt

(12)

Our empirical results below take ∆0 = 0.1.
The ACH(r, m) speciÞcation is then
ht =

1
1 + `{qt + δ 0 zt−1 }

(13)

for `(.) the function given in (12) and qt calculated from (7) through (10).
Given the hazards it is then simple to evaluate the log likelihood function. Notice from
(4) that the probability of observing xt given Υt−1 is
g(xt |Υt−1 ; θ1 ) = (ht )xt (1 − ht )1−xt
for θ1 = (δ 0 , α0 , β 0 )0 . Thus the conditional log likelihood is

L1 (θ1 ) =

T
X
t=1

{xt log (ht ) + (1 − xt ) log (1 − ht )}

(14)

which can then be maximized numerically with respect to θ1 . Robustness of numerical
maximization routines likely requires further restricting αj ≥ 0, β j ≥ 0, and 0 ≤ β 1 + ... +
β r ≤ 1.
It is of interest to note that the ACH model includes the ACD model as a special case
not only in terms of its implied value for the expected time separating target changes but
also in terms of the value of the likelihood function (14) in the limit as the time interval used
9

to discretize calendar time becomes arbitrarily small. This is demonstrated in the following
section.

3

Relation to Continuous-Time Models

The previous section took the perspective that time is discrete. Suppose instead that time
is continuous but we sample it in discrete intervals of length ∆; (note that ∆ was Þxed at
unity in the previous section). Then the log likelihood as calculated by the ACH model for
the observations between the target change at date w2t and the target change at date w1t
would be

w1t
X

τ =w2t +∆

{xτ log (hτ (∆)) + (1 − xτ ) log (1 − hτ (∆))}

(15)

where hτ (∆) denotes the probability of a change between τ and τ + ∆ and where the
summation over τ is in increments of ∆. Note that from the deÞnition of w1t and w2t , the term
xτ in (15) is zero for all but the last τ . Furthermore, if there are no exogenous covariates, then
hτ (∆) would be constant for all τ , that is, hτ (∆) = hw2t (∆) for τ = w2t +∆, w2t +2∆, ..., w1t .
Thus in the absence of exogenous covariates, expression (15) would become

log (hw2t (∆)) + log (1 − hw2t (∆))
=

w1t
X

(1 − xτ )

τ =w2t +∆

log (hw2t (∆)) + log (1 − hw2t (∆))

(w1t − w2t − ∆)
.
∆

(16)

The probability hτ (∆) of a change between τ and τ + ∆ of course vanishes as the time
increment ∆ becomes arbitrarily small. Suppose that associated with the sequence {hw2t (∆)}
10

for succeedingly smaller values of ∆ there exists a value ψ w2t such that,

hw2t (∆) = ψ −1
w2t ∆ + o(∆).

(17)

Expression (17) represents an assumption about the limiting continuous-time probability law
governing events that is often described as the Poisson postulate (see for example Chiang,
1980, p. 250). Notice by Taylor’s theorem,

log [1 − hw2t (∆)]

(w1t − w2t − ∆)
= − (w1t − w2t ) ψ −1
w2t + O(∆).
∆

(18)

Substituting (18) into (16), it is clear that (16) diﬀers from
log [hw2t (∆)] − (w1t − w2t ) ψ −1
w2t
by O(∆). Thus if we use the ACH model to evaluate the log likelihood for the observed target
changes between w2t and w1t for the Þxed interval ∆ = 1, and if (17) is a good approximation
for ∆ = 1, then

w1t
X

τ =w2t +1

(19)

' log(ψ −1
w2t ) − (w1t − w2t ) ψ w2t .

Suppose we were to index observations not by time but by the occurrence of changes in
the funds rate target. Thus observation i = 1 would correspond to the Þrst observed target
change, i = 2 to the second observed target change, and i = N to the last observed target
11

change. Let ũi denote the length of time between the i − 1 and the i target changes, so that
e denote the value
if the ith target change occurred at date w1t , then ũi = w1t − w2t . Let ψ

e = ψ . Then (19) implies that

where the approximation becomes arbitrarily good as the discrete sampling frequency on
which the left-hand side is based becomes Þner and Þner. The right-hand side of (20) will be
recognized as identical to equation (17) in Engle (2000), which is the form of the log likelihood
as calculated under the exponential autoregressive conditional duration speciÞcation. In the
e has the interpretation of the expected length of time between
ACD model, the parameter ψ

e is the expectation of u
events, that is, ψ

ei−1 , ..., u
e1 . Thus (20) reproduces
i

the familiar result that one can reparameterize the likelihood function for such processes
equivalently in terms of durations or in terms of hazards, where from (17) the expected
duration is essentially the reciprocal of the single period (∆ = 1) hazard.

Predicting the value of the target

Predicting the value of the Federal funds rate target for any given week requires answering
two questions. The Þrst is the question analyzed up to this point: Is the Fed going to change
the target this week or leave it in place? Second, if the Fed does change the target, by how
much will the target change? Such a time series is sometimes described as a marked point
process, in which “points” refers to the dates at which the target is changed (dates t for

12

which xt = 1) and “marks” refers to the sizes of the changes when they occur. Let yt be
the mark, or the magnitude of the target change if one occurs in week t. As before, let
zt−1 denote a vector of exogenous variables such as production, prices, and unemployment,
that inßuence the Fed’s decision on the target, and let Υt denote the history of observations
through date t,

0

0

0

Υt = (xt , yt , zt , xt−1 , yt−1 , zt−1 , ..., x1 , y1 , z1 )0 .

(21)

Our task is to model the joint probability distribution of xt and yt conditional on the past.
Without loss of generality this probability can be factored as:

f (xt , yt |Υt−1 ; θ1 , θ2 ) = g(xt |Υt−1 ; θ1 )q(yt |xt , Υt−1 ; θ2 ).

(22)

Our objective is to choose θ1 and θ2 so as to maximize the log likelihood,

T
X
t=1

log f (xt , yt |Υt−1 ; θ1 , θ2 ) = L1 (θ1 ) + L2 (θ2 )

(23)

where

L1 (θ1 ) =

T
X

log g(xt |Υt−1 ; θ1 )

(24)

log q(yt |xt , Υt−1 ; θ2 ).

(25)

t=1

is described in equation (14) while
L2 (θ2 ) =

T
X
t=1

13

If θ 1 and θ2 have no parameters in common, then maximization of (23) is equivalent to
maximization of (24) and (25) separately.

If they do have parameters in common, then

separate maximization would not be eﬃcient but would still lead to consistent estimates.2
Consider, then, the determinants of the marks, or the size of a target change given that
one occurs. Target changes typically occur in discrete increments of 25 basis points, though
changes as small as 6.25 basis points were sometimes observed prior to 1990. The discreteness
of the target changes suggests the use of an ordered response model as in Hausman, Lo, and
MacKinlay (1992). Since target changes only occur at particular dates, it is easiest to
describe this model by indexing observations by events i rather than dates t. Following the
notation of the previous section, we will use tildes to denote variables that are indexed by
events and no tildes for variables that are indexed by dates.
Let i = 1 correspond to the Þrst target change in the sample, i = 2 to the second target
change, and i = N to the last target change. Let yei denote the magnitude of the ith target

e i denote a vector of variables observed in the week prior to the ith target
change and let w

change that may have inßuenced the Fed’s decision of how much to change the target; if the

e i is a subset of the vector Υt−1 deÞned in equation

Data and Institutional Framework

The U.S. Federal Reserve requires banks to hold deposits in their accounts with the Fed so
as to exceed a minimum required level based on the volume of transactions deposits held by
the banks’ customers. Calculation of whether a bank satisÞes these reserve requirements is
16

based in part on the bank’s average Federal Reserve deposits held over a two-week period
beginning on a Thursday and ending on a Wednesday. If the Fed sells Treasury securities to
the public, the payments it receives from banks’ customers force banks to reduce their Fed
deposits. Given the need to continue to meet reserve requirements, banks are then forced to
try to borrow the reserves from other banks on the Fed funds market or from the Fed at the
Fed’s discount window, or to manage with a lower level of excess reserves. Banks’ aversion
to the second and third options causes the equilibrium interest rate on loans of Federal
funds to be bid up in response to the initial sale of securities by the Fed. The Trading Desk
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York carefully monitors banks’ reserve requirements
and available Fed deposits, and implements purchases or sales of Treasury securities (open
market operations) in order to achieve a particular target for the Federal funds rate.3
The raw data for our study are the dates and sizes of Federal funds target changes for
1984-1997 compiled by Glenn Rudebusch (1995) and updated by Volker Wieland.4

These

values are reported in Table 1. The nature of the target and details of its implementation
have changed considerably during our sample period. In the early part of the sample, the
directive for the Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was often framed in
terms of a desired level of “reserve pressure,” interpreted as an expected level of borrowing
from the Fed’s discount window (see for example Heller, 1988, or Meulendyke, 1998, pp. 139142). Given a relatively stable positive relation between discount window borrowing and

17

the Fed funds rate, this usually translated fairly directly into a target for the Fed funds rate
itself. However, a borrowed reserves target requires frequent adaptation of the procedure to
changes in market conditions. Table 1 reveals that, in the early part of the sample, target
changes almost always came on Thursday, either at the beginning of a new two-week reserve
maintenance period or halfway through in response to new market information. Moreover,
the target was characterized by small and frequent adjustments over this period.

Dates

of FOMC meetings and FOMC conference calls are given in Tables 2 and 3. In the latter
part of our sample, the FOMC directives were almost always implemented immediately. In
the early part of our sample, the FOMC directives usually were not implemented until the
week following the FOMC meeting, and additional changes often came much later, evidently
reßecting decisions made by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve under the broad guidelines
of earlier FOMC directives.
In principle, it would be possible to apply our ACH model to daily data with careful
modeling of these strong day-of-the-week eﬀects. We felt that little was lost by converting
our data to a weekly series, where for compatibility with the reserve-requirement cycle we
deÞne a week as beginning on a Thursday and ending on a Wednesday.

The target we

associate with any given week is the value for the target on the Þnal Wednesday of that
seven-day period. For eight weeks in our sample, there were two target changes within this
seven-day period, which in our constructed data were treated as a single large change.
Small, frequent changes in the target were perhaps a necessary aspect of the borrowed
reserves operating procedure, but they served another function as well, namely helping to

18

provide for Fed secrecy. When Chairman Paul Volcker allowed the Fed funds rate to reach
20% in 1981, he did not want the evening news reporting how much the Fed had deliberately
decided to kick up interest rates each day. The target changes in the early part of our sample
were virtually never announced publicly.
This does not mean that the market did not know about the changes in the target. On
the contrary, if the Fed made a large injection of reserves on a day when the Fed funds rate
was already trading below the previous target, market participants would quite accurately
and immediately know that the target had been lowered. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal
would report each day whether the target had been raised or lowered.

Cook and Hahn

(1989) constructed a time series for the target based exclusively on market inferences as
reported in the Wall Street Journal, and the series is quite close to the oﬃcial Trading Desk
Þgures used here.

Thus, Fed “secrecy”did not mean keeping the market confused about

what the Fed was up to; indeed, giving the market a clear understanding of the FOMC
target helped the Fed considerably to implement its goals. Instead, “secrecy” meant that
the nature of the inference was suﬃciently arcane and subtle that detailed Fed directives
were not reported by the nonÞnancial press and thus the Fed was insulated slightly from
political criticism for its weekly decisions.
Secrecy issues aside, a borrowed reserves operating procedure ultimately had to be disbanded for the simple reason that banks became virtually unwilling to borrow from the
discount window regardless of the level of the Federal funds rate.

Discount window bor-

rowing came to be viewed by a bank’s creditors as a signal of Þnancial weakness, inducing

19

banks to pay almost any cost to avoid it.

The dashed line in the top panel of Figure 1

plots monthly values for the level of discount window borrowing for adjustment purposes.
By 1991 discount window adjustment borrowing had essentially fallen to zero. Internal Fed
documents reveal that by 1989 the Fed was increasingly coming to ignore the borrowed
reserves target and eﬀectively target the Fed funds rate directly.5
When Alan Greenspan became Chairman in 1987, the Fed initially continued the policy
of borrowed reserves targeting and small, semi-secret target changes. A key event for the
transition to the current operating procedure occurred on November 22, 1989, when the Fed
added reserves at a time when the rate was below its 8-1/2 % target. The market interpreted
this as a signal that the target had been lowered, and a Fed policy change was announced in
the business press (Wall Street Journal, November 24, 1989, p. 2; November 28, 1989, p. 1).
In fact the Fed had not changed its target, but had added reserves because of its analysis
of the demand for borrowed reserves. This market reaction prompted a re-examination of
Fed procedure. One change shows up quite dramatically in the series for the assumption
that the Trading Desk made about the level of discount window borrowing in forming its
implementation of monetary policy each day, which appears as the solid line in the top
panel of Figure 1.6

Up until November 1989 this borrowing assumption series tracked

adjustment borrowing as best it could. After November, the Fed essentially assumed zero
adjustment borrowing, so that the borrowing assumption series becomes nearly identical to
5

the level of seasonal borrowing (Panels B and C of Figure 1). One further sees no change
in the target that is smaller than 25 basis points after November 1989, and no repeat of the
market confusion in interpreting Fed policy. Indeed, since 1994, the Fed has announced its
target Fed funds rate in complete openness.

Empirical Results
ACH estimates

We Þrst Þt the simple ACD(1, 1) model to our full weekly data set for Federal funds rate
target changes (March 1, 1984 to June 5, 1997) by maximizing the hazard-based likelihood
(14) with ht given by (5) and ψ t given by (3). The implied ACD model is as follows, with
standard errors based on second derivatives of the log likelihood in parentheses:
ψ t =0.29 + 0.131 (w1,t−1 − w2,t−1 )+ 0.889 ψ w1,t−1
(1.18)

(0.067)

(0.066)

log likelihood = -275.97.

(30)

These parameter estimates imply a highly persistent ACD process; indeed, (30) implies that
durations between events admit an ARMA(1,1) representation with autoregressive coeﬃcient
equal to 0.131 + 0.889 = 1.02, an explosive process.

A little exploration with additional

explanatory variables for the ACH model quickly revealed that this nonstationarity can be
attributed entirely to changes in Fed operating procedure detailed in the previous section.
We concluded that it is necessary to model the data as having been generated from two different regimes, the Þrst corresponding to the borrowed-reserves target regime (March 1,1984
to November 23, 1989) and the second to the explicit funds-rate target regime (November
30, 1989 to June 5, 1997).
21

For each subsample we considered a number of variables to include in the vector zt−1
in equation (13) to try to predict the timing of changes in the target.

The variables we

considered fall in three general categories: (1) variables reßecting the overall state of the
macroeconomy that may inßuence interest rates and the Fed’s broad policy objectives; (2)
monetary and Þnancial aggregates; and (3) variables speciÞc to the Trading Desk operating
procedures. Our Þnal models keep only those parameters that are statistically signiÞcant.
A detailed list of all the variables we tried is provided in Table 4.
Many of the variables that fall into the Þrst category are motivated by papers that
investigate the properties of Taylor rules (such as Clarida, Gali and Gertler (2000), McCallum
and Nelson (1999), Rudebusch and Svensson (1999), and Dueker (1999b)). It is common
in this literature to model the Fed’s reaction as a function of an inßation measure (we
tried a four-quarter average of the log-change in the GDP deßator, the 12-month average of
the log-change in the personal consumption expenditures deßator, the 12-month average of
the log-change in the consumer price index less food and energy); an output gap measure
(such as the percentage distance of actual GDP from potential GDP as measured by the
Congressional Budget Oﬃce) and lagged values of the Federal funds rate. In addition, to
allow for forward looking behavior, we investigated the 12-month inßation forecasts from the
Consumer Survey collected by the University of Michigan along with consumer expectations
on the unemployment rate and on business conditions. To complement these data, we
also experimented with the National Association of Purchasing Manager’s composite index,
and the composite indices of coincident and leading indicators published by the Conference

22

Board.
In category (2), monetary and Þnancial aggregates, we considered lagged values of the
Federal funds rate, M2, and the spread between 6-month Treasury Bill and the Federal
funds rate. Finally, the data contained in category (3) consisted of the dates of FOMC
meetings, Strongin’s (1995) measure of borrowed reserve pressure, the size of the previous
target change, and the duration (t − 1) − w1,t−1 since the previous change.
Despite an extensive literature relating Fed policy to such macroeconomic variables, we
Þnd that for the speciÞc task of predicting whether the Fed is going to change the target
during any given week, institutional factors and simple time-series extrapolation appear to
be far more useful than most of the above variables. Table 5 reports maximum likelihood
estimates for our favored model for the Þrst subsample. The estimates suggest persistent
serial correlation in the durations or hazards, with α + β = 0.97. Of the variables other
than lagged durations that we investigated, only two appear to be statistically signiÞcant.
The variable F OMCt−1 is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if there was an FOMC
meeting during week t − 1 and is zero otherwise, while ft−1 is simply the lagged value of the
eﬀective Fed funds rate.
The week following an FOMC meeting was considerably more likely to see a target
change than other weeks during this period.

SpeciÞcally, the average value for qt in this

subsample is 1.36 and the average value for ft−1 is 6.41. These imply a typical hazard of
1/(1 + 1.36 + 4.99 − 3.40) = 0.25, or a one in four chance that the Fed would change its
target next week. By contrast, in the week following an FOMC meeting, this probability

23

goes up to 1/(1 + 1.36 + 4.99 − 3.40 − 1.58) = 0.42. A high level of the Fed funds rate also
makes the Fed more likely to adjust its target quickly. The highest levels of the Fed funds
surpass 9% at the beginning and end of the subsample, in which case the probability of a
target change rises to 1/(1 + 1.36 + 4.99 − 4.77) = 0.39, even with no FOMC meeting. Both
these results are entirely consistent with the description of the way the Fed implemented
and adjusted the target during this period. What is perhaps surprising is that forecasting a
target change over this period appears to be entirely a matter of modeling the way the Fed
responded to immediate reserve pressures and the fact of an FOMC meeting; none of the
macroeconomic variables we investigated helped improve the forecasts of target changes.
By contrast, we found no evidence of serial correlation in the durations in the 1989-1997
subsample. Table 6 reports parameter estimates for a hazard model driven entirely by the
explanatory variables zt−1 with no role for lagged durations. Over this period, the Fed has
tended to implement target changes during the week of FOMC meetings rather than the
week after. The other variable that we found useful for forecasting target changes over this
period is |SP 6t−1 |, the absolute value of the spread between the eﬀective Federal funds rate
and the six month Treasury bill rate.
To get a sense of these estimates, the average absolute spread over this subperiod is 0.34,
implying a typical hazard of 1/(1 + 25.59 − 2.28) = 0.041; the Fed is extremely unlikely to
change the target during a week without an FOMC meeting, under the current regime. With
an FOMC meeting, the probability of a target change rises to 1/(1 + 25.59 − 2.28 − 19.27) =
0.20. If there is an FOMC meeting in week t and the previous week the spread had been

24

100 basis points or higher, a change in the target is virtually a sure thing.

6.2

Ordered probit estimates

Next we turn to empirical estimates of our ordered probit model for the marks, or the size
of Fed target changes when they occur. Our Þrst step was to consolidate the number of
possible categories for changes in the target. Historical changes occurred in increments of
6.25 basis points until December 1990 and in increments of 25 basis points afterwards. We
consolidated these earlier data (along with the one change of 75 basis points on November
15, 1994) as follows. If yei# denotes the actual value for the ith target change in Table 1, then
our analyzed data yei were deÞned as

yei# < 0.375

We then maximized the likelihood function L2 (θ2 ) in expression (29) with respect to π,
the coeﬃcients on the explanatory variables in (26), and the threshold parameters cj in
e i use the value of the variable for the week prior to the
(28). The explanatory variables w
target change.

Results are reported in Table 7. Most of the ACH explanatory variables

proved insigniÞcant for explaining the size of target changes and were dropped. We Þnd an
extremely strong eﬀect of yw1,t−1 ; if the previous change raised the target, then this week’s

25

change is much more likely to be an increase than a decrease. We Þnd an equally dramatic
negative inßuence of the ft−1 − T B6t−1 spread; if the Fed funds rate is above the 6-month
Treasury bill rate, then we can expect the Fed to lower the target.

Forecast evaluations

One advantage of the ACH framework is that it generates a closed-form expression for the
0

one-period-ahead forecast of the target it+1 based on observation of Υt = (it , zt , it−1 , zt−1 , ...)0
where zt = (ft , SP 6t )0 . SpeciÞcally,

0

7 with c0 = −∞ and c5 = ∞ and Υt π = 2.60(iw1,t − iw2 ,t ) − 0.42 SP 6t .
Multiperiod-ahead forecasts are substantially less convenient. One Þrst requires forecasts
of the explanatory variables zt+j . These can be generated with a VAR (with contemporaneous values of it included), estimated for each of the two sub-samples we consider at the
November 23, 1989 break-point. Thus, for example, our forecasting equations for ft and
SP 6t estimated by OLS over t = 3/8/84 to 11/23/89 are (standard errors in parenthesis):

ft = 0.218 + 0.347 ft−1 − 0.042 SP 6t−1 + 0.415 it − 0.219 it−1 ,

(33)

SP 6t = −0.184 − 0.492 ft−1 + 0.886 SP 6t−1 − 0.065 it + 0.549 it−1 .

Unfortunately, the forecast E(it+j+1 |Υt+j ) in (32) is a nonlinear function of Υt+j , so simulation methods are necessary for multiperiod-ahead forecasts. SpeciÞcally, (32) is derived
26

(1)

from a discrete probability distribution for it+1 |Υt and one can generate a value it+1 from this
distribution. If one further assumes that the errors in (33) and (34) are bivariate Gaussian,
(1)
then, given this value i(1)
t+1 , can generate a value zt+1 from (33) and (34), which represents a
(1)

draw from the distribution of zt+1 |Υt . Using zt+1 one can again use the distribution behind
(1)

(32) to generate a value it+2 , which now represents a draw from the distribution it+2 |Υt .
(1)

Iterating on this sequence produces at step j a value it+j which represents a single draw
from the distribution f(it+j |Υt ).

One can then go back to the beginning to generate a

represents the forecast

Most of the macro literature has focused on monthly values for the eﬀective Fed funds
rate rather than the weekly Fed funds target as here.

For purposes of comparison, we

estimated a monthly VAR similar to that used by Evans and Marshall (1998). The EvansMarshall VAR uses monthly data on the logarithm of nonagricultural employment (EM ); the
logarithm of personal consumption expenditures deßator in chain-weighted 1992 dollars (P );
the change in the index of sensitive materials prices (P COM); the eﬀective Federal funds
rate (f ); the ratio of nonborrowed reserves plus extended credit to total reserves (N BRX);
and the log growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2 (M 2). The model has twelve lags and
is estimated over the sample January 1965 to September 1997. The mean squared errors
for 1- to 12-month ahead forecasts for this VAR are reported in the Þrst column of Table 8.
We then ask, How good a job can our weekly model of the Fed funds target do at

27

predicting the monthly values of the eﬀective Fed funds rate?

We used our ACH and

ordered-probit model to forecast the value that the Fed funds target would assume the last
week of month τ + j based on information available as of the last week of month τ . We then
calculated the squared diﬀerence between this forecast for the target and the actual value
for the eﬀective Fed funds rate for month τ + j and report the MSE’s in the second column
of Table 8.
This would seem to be a tough test for our model, given that (a) the estimation criteria for
the VAR is minimizing the MSE whereas the estimation criteria for our model is maximizing
the likelihood function; and (b) the VAR is speciÞcally optimized for forecasting monthly
values of f whereas ours is designed to describe weekly changes in the target.

Even so,

attention to the short-run institutional details of Fed policy seems to yield substantially
superior forecasts of the monthly f at horizons up to 6 months.

Beyond 6 months, the

monthly VAR begins to do a signiÞcantly better job than our weekly model.7
We conclude that the ACH speciÞcation is worth considering as a realistic description
of the dynamics of the Fed funds target.

It thus seems of interest to revisit some of the

policy questions that have been addressed using linear VAR’s, to which we turn in the next
section.

See Rudebusch (1995) for further discussion of the properties of forecasts of the target over intermediate
horizons.

Estimating the eﬀects of monetary policy shocks

A great number of papers have attempted to measure the eﬀects of monetary policy based
on linear vector autoregressions. Let yτ denote a vector of macro variables for month τ ;
in the Evans and Marshall (1998) VAR, yτ = (EMτ , Pτ , P COMτ , fτ , NBRXτ , M 2τ )0 . Let
y1τ = (EMτ , Pτ , P COMτ )0 denote the variables that come before the eﬀective Fed funds
rate fτ and y2τ = (N BRXτ , M 2τ )0 the variables that come after. An estimate of the eﬀects
of a monetary policy shock based on a Cholesky decomposition of the residual variancecovariance matrix would calculate the impulse-response function,
∂E(yτ +s |fτ , y1τ , yτ −1 , yτ −2 , ...)
.
∂fτ
This is equivalent to Þnding the eﬀect on yτ +s of an orthogonalized shock to fτ , where an
orthogonalized shock is deÞned as
ufτ = fτ − E (fτ |y1τ , yτ −1 , yτ −2 , ...) .
Note that the shock can be written as
ufτ = fτ − fτ −1 − [E (fτ |y1τ , yτ −1 , yτ −2 , ...) − fτ −1 ].

(35)

A positive value for ufτ could thus come from two sources. On the one hand, the Fed could
have changed the target (fτ −fτ −1 > 0) when no change was expected (E (fτ |y1τ , yτ −1 , yτ −2 , ...)−
fτ −1 = 0). On the other hand, the Fed may not have changed the target (fτ − fτ −1 = 0)
even though the VAR had expected a drop (E (fτ |y1τ , yτ −1 , yτ −2 , ...) − fτ −1 < 0). Either
event would produce a positive ufτ . The two events are predicted to have the same eﬀect if
the data were generated from a linear VAR.
29

In a nonlinear model such as our ACH speciÞcation, however, the two events are not
forced to have the same eﬀects, and it is an interesting exercise to see what the model says
about their respective consequences. To do so, we start with the linear VAR,
yτ = c + Φ1 yτ −1 + Φ2 yτ −2 + ... + Φ12 yτ −12 + ετ .
We estimate the parameters (c, Φ1 , Φ2 , ..., Φ12 ) by OLS equation by equation.

We also

need the forecast of y2τ given y1τ and iτ . This can be obtained by estimating the following
system by OLS, one equation at a time,
y2τ = d + d1 iτ + D0 y1τ + B1 yτ −1 + B2 yτ −2 + ... + B12 yτ −12 + u2τ ,

(36)

where d1 in the Evans-Marshall example is a (2 × 1) vector, D0 is a (2 × 3) matrix, and
Bj are (2 × 6) matrices. Given any hypothesized value for iτ and the historical values for
y1τ , yτ −1 , yτ −2 , ..., one can then calculate the forecast ỹ2τ |τ (iτ ) from (36).

Collect these

forecasts along with the historical y1τ and the hypothesized iτ in a vector
0

0

ỹτ |τ (iτ ) = (y1τ , iτ , ỹ2τ |τ (iτ ))0 .

(37)

The one-step-ahead VAR forecast conditional on the hypothetical iτ is:
Ê(yτ +1 |iτ , y1τ , yτ −1 , yτ −2 , ...) = c + Φ1 ỹτ |τ (iτ ) + Φ2 yτ −1 + ... + Φ12 yτ −11 .

(38)

We then replace the fourth element of the vector of conditional forecasts in (38), corresponding to the forecast of the eﬀective Fed funds rate fτ +1 , with the forecast target rate for the
last week of month τ + 1. This forecast is calculated as in the previous section based on
historical values of variables available at date τ , with the historical value for the target at
30

date τ replaced by the hypothesized value of iτ . Call the resulting vector ỹτ +1|τ (iτ ). Next,
we use the VAR coeﬃcients to generate two-step-ahead forecasts conditional on iτ :
Ê(yτ +2 |iτ , y1τ , yτ −1 , yτ −2 , ...) = c + Φ1 ỹτ +1|τ (iτ ) + Φ2 ỹτ |τ (iτ ) + ... + Φ12 yτ −10 .

(39)

We again replace the fourth element of (39) with the forecast of iτ +2 implied by the ACH
model and call the result ỹτ +2|τ (iτ ). Iterating in this manner, we can calculate ỹτ +j|τ (iτ ),
which summarizes the dynamic consequences of the forecast time path for iτ , iτ +1 , ... implied
by the ACH model for other macroeconomic variables of interest.
To measure the consequences of the Þrst term in (35), we ask, What diﬀerence does
it make if the Fed raises the target by 25 basis points during month τ (iτ = iτ −1 + 0.25)
compared to if it had kept the target constant (iτ = iτ −1 )? We then normalize the answer
in units of a derivative, as
¯
¯
£
¤
(0.25)−1 ỹτ +j|τ (iτ ) ¯iτ =iτ−1 +0.25 − ỹτ +j|τ (iτ ) ¯iτ =iτ −1 .

(40)

If we had not replaced the fourth element of (38) and (39) at each iteration with the ACH
forecast, the resulting value in (40) would not depend on τ or iτ −1 and would be numerically
identical to the standard VAR impulse-response function based on the Cholesky decomposition. As is, the value of (40) does depend on τ and iτ −1 , and to report results we therefore
average (40) over the historical values τ = 1, ..., T and y1 , ..., yT in our sample.
The second term in (35) asks, What would happen if we predicted a change in the target
but none occurred? Letting õ̂τ |τ −1 denote the forecast for the target in month τ based on

31

historical information available at date τ − 1, we thus calculate

where

¯
h
i
¯
¯
ω τ ỹτ +j|τ (iτ ) ¯iτ =iτ −1 − ỹτ+j|τ (iτ ) ¯iτ =õ̂τ|τ −1
ωτ =




 (iτ −1 − õ̂τ |τ −1 )−1 if |iτ −1 − õ̂τ |τ −1 | > 0.02

 0

(41)

.

otherwise

The eﬀect of the weight ω τ in (41) is to ignore observations for which no change was expected
and to rescale positive or negative forecast errors into units comparable to (40). Again if we
had not replaced the VAR forecasts of fτ +j with the ACH forecasts of iτ +j , the magnitude
in (41) would be not depend on τ and would be numerically identical to the VAR impulseresponse function.
Figure 2 calculates the eﬀects of three diﬀerent kinds of monetary policy shocks. The
solid line is the linear VAR impulse-response function, describing the eﬀects of a 100-basispoint increase in fτ on each of the Þve other variables in yτ +j for j = 0 to 11 months. This
replicates the conventional results — an increase in the Federal funds rate is associated with
an initial decrease in nonborrowed reserves and in M2, and is followed within 6 months by a
decline in employment and prices. The short-dashed line records the average values of (40)
over all the dates τ in our sample, which we interpret as the answer to the question, What
happens when the Federal Reserve deliberately raises its target for the Federal funds rate?
The eﬀects are qualitatively similar to the VAR impulse-response function, but quantitatively
are much bigger — a policy change implies a bigger contraction in NBRX or M2 than the
orthogonalized VAR innovations ufτ , and the negative consequences for employment and
32

prices are much bigger as well.

The long-dashed line records the average values of (41),

which answers the question, What happens if one would have predicted that the Fed was
going to lower the target, but in fact it did not? The results are completely diﬀerent, and
suggest that the Fed’s decision not to lower the target is typically an endogenous response to
the Fed’s accurate predictions of a strong economy and surging prices and money demand.
The linear VAR, which essentially is an average of these two scenarios, thus appears to be
mixing together the answers to two very diﬀerent experiments.

Conclusions

This paper introduced the autoregressive conditional hazard model for generating a timevarying serially dependent probability forecast for a discrete event such as a change in the
Federal funds rate targeted by the Federal Reserve. The advantage over the closely related
autoregressive conditional duration speciÞcation is the ability to incorporate new information
on other variables into the forecast.
We Þnd that the change in Federal Reserve operating procedures from borrowed reserves targeting over 1984-1989 to an explicit Fed funds rate target since 1989 show up quite
dramatically through this investigation. We also Þnd that, in our nonlinear model, “innovations” in monetary policy are not all the same.

SpeciÞcally, an increase in the target

results in a much more dramatic eﬀect on employment and prices than does the prediction
of a target decrease that fails to materialize.

Figure 1. Top panel: adjustment borrowing at the Fed discount window (dashed line)
and the Fed Trading Desk’s borrowing assumption (solid line).

Middle panel: seasonal

borrowing at the Fed discount window (dashed line) and the Fed Trading Desk’s borrowing
assumption (solid line). Bottom panel: the borrowing assumption minus seasonal borrowing.
Figure 2.

Eﬀect on yτ +j for j = 0, 1, ..., 11 of diﬀerent deÞnitions of an ”innovation”

in the Fed funds rate.

Solid line: innovation means a forecast error in the VAR. Short-

dashed line: innovation means that the Fed raised the Fed funds target.

Long-dashed

line: innovation means a forecast target change that failed to materialize. Diﬀerent panels
correspond to the diﬀerent elements of y.
