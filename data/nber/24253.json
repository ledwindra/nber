    "abstract": "\n\nThanks to big data, artificial intelligence (AI) has spurred exciting innovations. In the meantime, AI and big data are reshaping the risk in consumer privacy and data security. In this essay, I first define the nature of the problem and then present a few facts about the ongoing risk. The bulk of the essay describes how the U.S. market copes with the risk in current policy environment. It concludes with key challenges facing researchers and policy makers.\n\n",
