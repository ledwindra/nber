This paper analyzes the relation between exogenous changes in commodity
export prices and the real exchange rate in a monetary economy. The
traditional Dutch—Disease case is extended, and the monetary consequences of

an export boom are explored. It is shown that commodity export booms can
generate, in the short run, either an excess demand or an excess Supply for

money. In a monetary setting the short—run behavior of the real exchange rate
can differ significantly from the more traditional Dutch-Disease case without

money. The model is tested using data for Colombia.

I. INTRODUCTION
A number of papers have recently analyzed the way in which commodity

export booms affect production in other sectors of the economy. Most of these
studies have focused on the behavior of the real exchange rate as the main
transmission mechanism from the booming sector to the rest of the economy.
This literature, which has come to be known as the Dutch Disease literature,
has postulated that a commodity export boom will generally result in a real
appreciation of the domestic currency, increased production of non—tradable
goods and a decline in production and employment of the rest (i.e., non—boom)
tradable sector. 1

However, commodity export booms can also have important

short—run monetary effects, which will spill over to the real exchange rate.

For example, a resource—based export boom will typically result in a balance

of payments surplus and in the accumulation of international reserves. If
this increase in reserves is not sterilized, the monetary base will increase

and an excess supply of money may develop. If this is the case, the final
effect will be inflation. This increase in the price level will, in general,
be one of the mechanisms through which the real appreciation will actually

take place. 2 It is possible, however, for the short—run increase in the rate
of inflation to exceed what is required to bring about the equilibrium real

appreciation generated by the export boom; in this case, the the real exchange
rate will appreciate in the short run by more than what real factors only

would indicate. These short-run monetary effects of commodity export booms
have recently been important in a number of developing countries, including
Indonesia, Kenya and Colombia.

In this paper a model of a developing country that relies heavily on

the exports of a particular good (the "commodity export" for short) is fully

worked out. The model emphasizes the effects of changes in commodity export
prices on money creation and inflation. The model also allows for a fairly
general exchange rate policy, ranging from a fixed nominal rate to a crawling

peg based on a PPP rule. The model is empirically tested using data for
Colombia. Experts have generally argued that fluctuatios in Colombia's real
exchange rate have been mainly determined by world coffee price movements,

with most observers emphasizing the consequences of coffee price change on
money creation and inflation.

II. THE MODEL

In this paper a model that can be used to analyze the way in which
commodity export prices, money creation, inflation and the real exchange rate
interact is presented. 3

The model is developed for the case of a small

developing country, with capital controls and no domestic financial market.

The model consists of three interrelated main building blocks——a
money market block, an inflation block and an exchange rate block.
The Monetary Block

The first equation in the monetary block describes the process of
money creation.

Mt = a

Rt + (1—a) DCRt

(1)

As 'usual X denotes the percentage change in variable X. Mt is, then, the rate
of growth of nominal money, DCRt is the rate of growth of domestic credit, and

—3—
a and (1-a) are base year shares. Domestic credit creation, in tim, is
assumed to depend on the fiscal deficits as a proportion of high powered money
(DEF). This assumption captures the fact that in most less developed
countries (LDCs) the creation of money is an important source of financing for
government expenditure.

DCRt =

DEFt.

(2)

Regarding international reserves behavior through time, it is assumed

that reserves respond to two factors. First an excess flow demand or supply
for money will be reflected in accumulation or decumulation of reserves.

Second, changes in the domestic price of the commodity export in period t will
be translated, in the same period, into corresponding changes in reserves.
These assumptions regarding reserves behavior are captured by equation (3).

—

(3)

where R are international reserves expressed in domestic currency; Md is the
nominal quantity of money demanded,

is the price of the commodity export

expressed in domestic currency. The world and domestic prices of the
commodity export are linked by the following equation:

=

where

EtP

(14)

is the world price of this commodity and where Et is the nominal

—Li—

exchange rate in period t, expressed as units of domestic currency per unit of
foreign currency.
The novelty of equation (3)

is

that, contrary to most monetary models

of open economies, it explicitly allows for international reserve shocks to be

a source of money creation in the short run. In the long run, however,
=

and reserves will not change (i.e.,

0).

The monetary side of the model is closed by an equation for the rate

of change of the nominal demand for money. Assuming that the demand for money
function depends only on real income, we have:

Combining equations (1) through (5) we can obtain a first order semi—reduced
form that describes the motion of money through times:

Since O<a0<1 the convergence of (6) will be oscillatory.

Inflation Block

The inflation side of the model is formed by four equations. The
first one is the definition of the price level. Expressed in percentage
changes we have:

Pt =

1Nt Tt
+

(6)

—5—
Where

is the rate of change of nontradable prices and Tt is the rate of

change of the price of tradables other than the commodity export, or "other
tradables."

The rate of change of the price of these other tradables, in

turn, is assumed to be equal to the rate of change of the nominal exchange
rate pLis the rate of change of the world price of the other tradables:

Tt =

Et

+

Tt

The rate of change of the price of nontradables will depend on the

change in the price of other tradables, real income and the excess flow supply
for money in period t: 8

Combining (6), (7) and (8) with equation (5) on the demand for money,
we obtain the following semireduced form for the domestic rate of inflation:

III. THE RATE OF CRAWL AND THE DEFINITION OF THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE

The model is closed with three equations: the first one defines the
rate of devaluation of the nominal exchange rate, or rate of crawl; the second
equation relates real income to the price of the commodity export; and the
third equation provides the definition of the real exchange rate.

—6--

The following expression summarizes the rule of the rate of crawl
assumed to be followed by the monetary authorities at any moment in time:

This is a fairly general equation, that allows for a number of

possible exchange rate policies. For example, t' =

however,

changes in the commodity export price will have an impact on the real exchange
rate, and will try to accommodate this effect through a slowing down of the

rate of devaluation. In the present paper it will be assumed that
Regarding real income, it is assumed that changes in the real price

of the commodity export (i.e., changes in the terms of trade) generate
deviations of real income from its long—run trend:

IV. THE SOLUTION TO THE MODEL

Permanent Monetary Equilibrium
The model can be further divided into a real and a monetary block.

The real side, which is comprised of equations (8) and (11), can be solved

under the assumption of full and permanent monetary equilibrium. In this case
the mode becomes similar to most models on Dutch Disease which have tradi—

tionally concentrated on real aspects only. Assuming permanent monetary equilibrium, E = 0

,

replacing

(11) with (8) and using the definition given by

equation 12, the change in the real exchange rate resulting from changes in
the commodity export world price is:

e=—

<0

(13)

This means that a (permanent) increase in the world price of the cothmodity

export will generate a real appreciation of the domestic currency. In fact,
equation (13) is the spending effect of a commodity export boom emphasized in
the Dutch Disease literature (Corden, 198!t). This real appreciation takes
place because, as a result of the boom, there is an increase in expenditure on

non—tradables. In order to maintain equilibrium in the non-tradable goods
market, its relative price has to increase. Note from equation (13) that the
extent of the real appreciation depends on the value of

elasticity of demand for non-tradables. If c

,

the

income

= 0 —-that is, if none of the

increased real income is spent on non—tradables—-the commodity export boom

will have no effect on the real exchange rate. This, of course, is a standard
result in the Dutch Disease literature. However, the model derived in this

-8—
paper goes beyond the real effects of a commodity export boom, emphasizing the
monetary and inflationary repercission of changes in commodity export prices.
Short-Run Monetary Disequilibrium
Allowing for short—run monetary disequilibrium, the cor1lete model

works in the following way. As in the real side model, an increase in the
real world price of the commodity export results in higher real income

(through equation (11)), and in an increased demand for non-tradables. This
higher demand, in turn, affects, through equation (8), the relative price of
non-tradables, generating the already discussed spending effect.

On the money side, the higher price of the commodity exports with its
resulting higher real income and price of nori-tradables affects both the

demand and the supply for money. From equation (14), a higher demand for

nominal (and real) money will result. The few Dutch Disease models that have
incorporated monetary factors have emphasized this increase of the demand for
money as a result of the export boom.

12 A particularly important effect of

this higher demand for real money is that, if an excess demand for money

results, some deflationary effect the boom can take place. This is because if
after the boom the supply for money does not change, monetary equilibrium can

only be reestablished if Pt decreases or if

goes down (equation (5)).

However, an excess demand for money is only one of the possible mone-

tary consequences of the export boom. In fact, according to equatIons (3) and
(1), after the boom international reserves will accumulate, and the rate of

growth of money will also be higher. Whether the final result is an excess
demand or an excess supply for money will depend on the relative values of

some of the parameters in the model. In particular, if cY1>(l—Y0)o ,

the

commodity export boom will result In a short—run excess supply for money. In

—9the rest of this section it will be assumed, unless otherwise indicated, that
the export boom will generate an excess sipply for money.
Under this assumption, the resulting excess supply of money will
impact the nominal price of' non-tradables, further appreciating 'She real

exchange rate. What is the role of the nominal exchange rate policy in our

story? Two things will happen according to equation (10). First, as a result
of the higher commodity export price, the rate of the crawl will be slowed
down in period t, helping to accommodate the real appreciation generated by

the spending effect. Second, there will be a tendency to partially compensate
the nominal exchange rate for the higher rate of inflation, throught c0P.
The final effect will be a real appreciation resulting, partially, from the

slowing down of the rate of the crawl and partially from higher inflation. If
the liquidity or money creation effect generated by the higher price of coffee
is large enough, the real appreciation can be larger in the short run than in

the long run [see Edwards (1984c).
The model can be formally solved for the rate of change of the real

exchange rate as a function of exogenous variables only. Equations (6), (9)
and (10) are first solved for Et,

and P.

Then, the definition of the

real exchange rate is used to find e:

From this expression we can find how an increase in the world price
of the commodity export affects the real exchange rate in the short run.

Furthermore, from the comparison of equations (1) and (13), it is possible to
find out the extent to which, after the boom, the short-run real exchange rate
diverges from the new long—run equilibrium real exchange rate.
Let is now foe is on the way in which changes in the commodity export

price affect the short—run real exchange rate. Term A captures the spending
effect of a change in the price of the commodity export on the real exchange

rate. Since stability requires that D>O, the spending effect will, as
expected, generate a real appreciation. Let is now turn to the inflation and

exchange rate effects. These are captured by term B. As can be seen from
this expression, there are three different channels, in addition to the
spending effect, through which changes in the commodity export price will

affect e. Two of these channels indicate that a higher commodity price will
generate a real appreciation. The third channel, however, suggests that—
e and p

are positively related. Let is first look at the forces that

suggest that there is a negative effect of p

on e

First, a higher world

price of the commodity resilts in an increase in international reserves and

money growth in the same period. Assuming that, as a consequence, an excess
flow supply for money results, this will generate inflation and, with other

things given, a real appreciation. Second, according to equation (10), an

— 11

—

increase in the world price of this commodity slows down the rate of the
crawl. This also works towards generating a real appreciation, with other
things given. The forces that tend to generate a real depreciation as a
consequence of the export boom are of a second order magnitude, -nd work

through the following channel. The higher world commodity export price
reduces the rate of the crawl and consequently, through equation (10), the

domestic price of tradables and inflation. These lower rates of inflation and
devaluation, in turn will tend to result in a lower rate of domestic money

creation, through equation (12), and even lower inflation. This lower inflation, of course, will generate with other things given, a real depreciation.

However, given the second order nature of this effect, the strong presumption
is that under normal circumstances (i.e., under plausible values of the para-

meters involved), the appreciation effects will dominate. This is, however,
an empirical issue, which can be resolved by estimating the model. 13

V. AN APPLICATION: COFFEE AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE IN COLOMBIA
In this section the model developed above is applied to the case of

Colombia. The performance of the Colombian economy has been traditionally
linked to the behavior of the world coffee market.

A nimber of aithors

have argued that changes in the world price of coffee have been transmitted
into Colombia mainly through the effect that they have on the real exchange
rate [Weisner (1978), Urrutia (1981), World Bank (1984), Edwards (19814c,

1986)J. Increases (decreases) in the world price of coffee have generated
real appreciations (depreciations) of the Colombian peso. These variations in
the real exchange rate, in turn, have affected the degree of competitiveness
of the non—coffee tradables sectors, with a real appreciation generating loss

- 12

of

-

competitiveness or exchange rate ttdeprotection.tt For example, the coffee

bonanza of 1975—79 resulted in a sharp real appreciation, which negatively
affected the ability of the domestic sector to compete in international

markets. Earlier episodes of sharp increases in the price of c&fee (1950,
1954 and 1956, for example) have also been related to steep appreciations of
the peso [Weisner (1978), World Bank (19814)]. In Table 1, data on real

effective exchange rates, coffee prices, terms of trade, rate of growth of
reserves and high-powered money, inflation, and the nominal rate of
devaluation for 1968—82 are presented.

In the Colombian case, the monetary and inflationary effects of

coffee price increases have been important. For example, as the data in
Table 1 show, the 1975—79 coffee bonanza generated a steep increase in inter-

national reserve holdings and in money creation. The crucia1 role of the
increase in the rate of money creation after the different coffee booms has

Note: The real price of coffee is defined as the US$ coffee price deflated by the
US$ import price index. The effective exchange rate was computed using trade
weights and taking into account Colombia's ten major trade partners. The
partners (and weights) are: U.S. (0.507); U.K. (0.047); France (0.037);
Germany (0.163); Italy (0.033); Netherlands (0.0114); Japan (0.058); Sweden
(0.032); Spain (0.035); and Venezuela (0.0145). According to the definitions
of real exchange rate used in this paper an increase in the index reflects a
real depreciation, whereas a decline in the index reflects a real depreciation, whereas a decline in the index represents a real appreciation. The raw
data were taken fromn the IFS.

been forcefully pointed out by a number of experts on the colombian economy,
including Urrutia (1981), Weisner (1978) and Karnes (1985).
Since World War II, the Colombian authorities have tried to use

several schemes to reduce the impact of changes in coffee prices on the real

exchange rate and on the rest of the economy. The main objective of the
government during this period has been to reduce the undesirable short—run
effects that temporary changes in coffee prices have on the degree of profita—

- 1L -

bility,

production and employment in the rest of the economy. 15 For many

years returns from coffee exports were subject to a lower net rate of

exchange. Also, in the past, the degree of import protection was altered
depending on the behavior of coffee prices; it was reduced as a 'onsequence of
increases in the price of coffee, and raised when the world price of coffee

declined. In addition, several monetary measures—-including steep increases
in the banking system's reserves requirements--have been implemented when the
price of coffee has risen. 16

A number of experts have indicated that the adoption of a crawling
peg system in 1967 responded to the need to reduce the dependence of the real
exchange rate on coffee price fluctuations [Weisner (1978), Urrutia (1981),
Ocatnpo (1982)]. However, since the inception of the crawling peg system, the
decision on the rate at which the peso should be devalued has been highly
influenced by coffee prices. For example, according to Weisner (1978) , once

the crawling peg was adopted, one of the main problems was to decide "at what

pace to devalue when coffee prices rise" (p. 203). This problem has been compounded by the existence of a trade-off between the rate of nominal devalia-

tion and inflation, In practice there has been an inverse relationship
between the rate of devaluation of the peg and coffee prices. The high coffee
prices of 1976—79, for example, were accompanied by a significant slowdown of
the rate of devaluation; when the price of coffee began to fall in 1980—82,

the rate of the crawl was rapidly accelerated. This inverse relationship
between world coffee prices and the nominal rate of devaluation constitutes
another mechanism--in addition to the money creation inflationary effect--

— 15

—

through which higher (lower) coffee prices have been translated into a lower
(higher) real exchange rate.

In this section annual data for Colombia for 1960-82 are used to

econometrically analyze the extent to which changes in coffee prices have, in

fact, influenced the real exchange rate in that country. This empirical
analysis is carried out in two ways. First, a reduced form equation for the
rate of change of the real exchange rate is estimated. This equation, which
is in some ways similar to equation (1k) above, relates changes in the real
exchange rate in Colombia to changes in the price of coffee and other real
exogenous variables suggested by the theory.

17

Second, the model developed

in Section II, which incorporates the role of monetary sectors in the short
run, is explicitly developed by estimating simultaneously the money, inflation
and rate of crawl equations from the model of Section II.

VI. REAL EXCHANGE RATE BEHAVIOR IN COLOMBIA: REDUCED FORM ANALYSIS
In this sub—section some preliminary econometric evidence on the

behavior of the real exchange rate in Colombia is presented. The analysis is
based on the estimation of reduced form equations and, as in
focuses

section two definitions of the real

exchange rate are used: RER is a bilateral measure of the real exchange rate
computed as the nominal rate with respect to the U.S. dollar (pesos per

dollar), times the U.S. WPI and divided by Colombia's CPI. REER, on the other
hand, is an index of the effective real exchange rate, computed relative to a
basket of ten currencies where a weighted average of the trade partner's WPI's
is used in the numerator and Colombia's CPI is used as a deflator in the

- 16 -

denominator.

According to these definitions of the real exchange rate an

increase in these indexes denotes a real depreciation, whereas a decline
indicates that the domestic currency is appreciating in real terms.

In addition to investigating the nature of the relatio' between
coffee price (and terms of trade) changes and the real exchange rates, two

other hypotheses are tested. The first is that the rate of growth in income
per capita and the rate of change of the real exchange rate are negatively

related. This hypothesis is derived from the Ricardo—Balassa effect, which
states that countries with a higher rate of productivity gains will experience

a real appreciation in their currency. In the model derived In Section II
this effect of the rate of growth of real income on the real exchange rate was

captured by term K In equation (H). In this study the rate of growth of per
capita income is used as a proxy to measure these productivity gains. The
other hypothesis being tested refers to the relationship between the levels of
import protection and the real exchange rate. 18

Even though in a general

equilibrium setting with exportables, importables and non—tradeable goods the
effect of changes in import tariffs on the real exchange rate cannot be
determined a priori, the presumption is that for most countries higher tariffs

result in a real appreciation (Edwards 1984a). In the regression analysis the
following reduced forms for the real exchange rate were estimated:

It is expected, then, that a1 ,b1 < 0, and that a2,b2,a3,b3 < 0.

In

equation (16), changes in the real price of coffee (p) are used instead of
the change in the terms of trade (r), since changes in coffee prices are the
main determinants of i and because our main interest is to investigate how
changes in the price of the main commodity export affect the real exchange
rate.

The results obtained from the estimation of equations (15) and (16),

as well as some variants, using OLS, are presented in Table 2. As can be
seen, while all the coefficients have the expected signs, only a few are

significant at conventional levels. On the other hand, the goodness of fit,
as measured by the R2, is rather poor. Nevertheless, these results provide

some preliminary evidence that the hypothesized negative effect of terms of
trade

changes-—and especially coffee's terms of trade changes-—on the real

exchange rate in Colombia is indeed present.

A problem with these estimates is that by concentrating on reduced
forms, they do not capture most of the action, missing in particular the
mechanisms through which coffee price changes are transmitted into the real

exchange rate. For this reason in the next section the model developed in
Section II is explicitly tested.

COFFEE, MONEY, INFLATION AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE IN COLOMBIA
In the preceding section, results obtained from the estimation of

reduced form equations for changes in the real exchange rate in Colombia were

presented. These regressions indicated that changes in the wor (real) price
of coffee have had a [marginally] significant negative effect on the real

exchange rate in Colombia. However, a problem with these results is that, as
in most analyses based on reduced form regressions, the mechanisms through
which a particular exogenous variable (the price of coffee) affects the

endogenous variable (the real exchange rate) is not explicitly presented. In
the colombian case this is particularly troublesome, since by basing the
analysis on reduced forms the possible monetary effect of higher prices of

coffee is missed. In this section this problem is faced by directly
estimating a version of th model presented in Section II. 19
In this section the three main equations from the model (eqiations
(6), (9) and (10)) are estimated simultaneously. The estimation was performed

using annual data for 1952—1980, with an explicit distinction made between the

pre—1976 period and the post—1967 period. The following variant of the money
creation equation (6) was estimated (where the v1s are error terms):

The following version of the inflation equation (9) was estimated,

where DUM is a dummy variable that takes a value of zero up to 1967 and a
value of one from there onward.

The most interesting result from the estimation of this equation is
that it confirms the hypothesis that higher (domestic) prices of coffee have

resulted in short-run increases in the rate of money creation. As discussed
above, the mechanism through which this takes place is the accimulation of

international reserves that are monetized by the Central Bank. Also, estimates of the coefficients of the lagged M suggest that the effect of changes

in coffee prices on money growth have some persistence through time. The
estimation of the money growth equation, then, provides statistical support to
the claim made by numerois authors [i.e., Weisner (1978), Urritia (1981)] that
in Colombia the ability to perform monetary policy has been hampered by the

dependence of money creation on the behavior of coffee prices. Also, these
results support the hypothesis that the process of money creation in Colombia
has been critically influenced by the behavior of the fiscal side of the

— 21

economy.

-

An increase in the fiscal deficit-—measured as a proportion of

lagged base money--of 10 percentage points has resulted, on average, in an
increase in the rate of growth of money of approximately 1.8 to 2.2

percentage

points. This finding points out that the separation of the fisr'l and
monetary sides in traditional macroeconomic analysis might not be fully
applicable to LDCs. 20

With the exception of income growth and the dummy variable, the

coefficients are significant and have the expected signs. The coefficient of
Mt indicates that, with other things given, an increase in the rate of money
creation by 10 percentage points has resulted in an increase of inflation of

approximately 7 percentage points. On the other hand, according to the

coefficient of (E +

a higher rate of devaluation and/or higher world

inflation, will be passed on almost one—third to price increases. 21 As the
model indicates, the sum of the coefficients of

and (Et +

is not

significantly different from one. However, the coefficient of real income
growth was, in all runs, insignificant.

These results confirm the hypothesis that the Colombian authorities

have taken into account the behavior of world coffee prices when deciding by

how much to devalue the nominal exchange rate. Lower (higher) world coffee
prices result in higher (lower) rates of devaluation of the crawl. Also,
according to this equation, in the past——1967 period——after the crawling peg
was adopted--and with other things given, the exchange rate tended to be

adjusted by less than the ongoing domestic rate of inflation. On the other
hand, while the coefficient of the world rate of inflation is negative, as
expected, the absolute value of its point estimate is very small and not
significant.

VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, the interaction between changes in commodity export

prices and the real exchange rate has been investigated. tn Section II, a
model that relates coffee price changes to money creation, inflation and the

rate of devaluation was developed. The model was then estimated for
Colombia. A virtue of this model is that it highlights two of the channels
that have been traditionally pointed out in casual discussions on the effect

of commodity price changes on the real exchange rate: money creation and
inflation and the rate of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate (i.e., the
rate of devaluation of the crawling peg).

— 23

-

The model shows that commodity export booms will generally generate
short—run increases in money creation, inflation and a real appreciation. In
fact it is possible that the real appreciation generated through this channel

exceeds the "equilibrium" real appreciation resulting from the om. If this
boom is perceived as temporary, the real appreciation will be smaller, but
could still be significant.

The model presented in this chapter was empirically tested for the

case of coffee in Colombia. Two approaches were taken in the empirical
section. First, a reduced form equation that relates changes in the real
exchange rate to changes in the price of coffee, and other exogenous vari-

ables, was estimated. The results obtained provided preliminary evidence
indicating that increases (reductions) in the world price of coffee have

indeed resulted in a real appreciation (depreciation). Second, the model
developed in Section II was explicitly tested using a simultaneous equation

approach. The results obtained indicate that coffee price changes have indeed
been closely related to money creation and inflation. Also, coffee price
changes have been negatively related to the rate of devaluation. These
results indicate that in Colombia, the real appreciation resulting from coffee
price increases has been accommodated, partially by money creation and infla-

tion, and partially by an adjustment in the nominal exchange rate. The model
used in this paper has been deliberately kept small and simple. As a result,
it has been possible to clearly pinpoint the role of coffee in the inflation-

ary and devaluation process. A cost of this approach, however, has been that
some simplifying assumptions had to be made.

7. Notice that in defining the price level, we have assumed that the commodity export does not enter into this index. This is a realistic assumption, since developing countries usually consume very little of their main
export.

10. In Edwards (1986) a more general rule of crawl is assumed.
11. It is also possible to define the real exchange rate as the PPP real

rate. See Edwards (1986) for the derivation of a similar model, where the
real exchange rate is defined in that way.

13. Notice that the model presented here has ignored the distinction between

taken into account.

(1983), Weisner (1978), Kamas (1983), World Bank (1983a, 198Th). Coffee
represents approximately 55 percent of Colombia's foreign earnings from

legal exports. It is important to notice that the presence of important
illegal exports makes the empirical analysis of Colombia's external sector

quite difficult. For obvious reasons there are no reliable data on the
magnitude of these illegal transactions. On the importance of illegal
exports in Colombia, see Junguito and Caballero (1978).
15. See Weisner (1978).

16. In that regard, the results from this reduced form can be viewed as preliminary, since they ignore the possible short—run effects of monetary
variables.

17. The effect of commercial policies changes on the real exchange rate have

traditionally been explained in the literature. In order to simplify the
discussion, the model of Section II ignored commercial policy. However,
the result reported in this section indicate that for the case of Colombia
the effect of changes in trade taxes have not been very important in
determining the behavior of the real exchange rate.
18. Some of the results reported in this subsection draw on Edwards (1986).
19. The positive effect of changes in coffee prices on the rate of money

creation is very robist to changes in the specification in the money

growth equation. For alternative specifications, see Edwards (1986).
20. These results are consistent with those reported in Hanson (1982).
