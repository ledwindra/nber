    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop and estimate a model of the union's optimal extent of\norganizing activity that accounts for the decision of employers regarding\nresistance to union organizing. The central exogenous variable in the\nanalysis is the quantity of quasi-rents per worker available to be split\nbetween unions and employers.\nWe measure available quasi-rents per worker as the difference per\nworker between total industry revenues net of raw materials costs and labor\ncosts evaluated at the opportunity cost of the workers. Using two-digit\nindustry level data for thirty-five U.S. industries for the period 1955\nthrough 1986, we find that both organizing activity and employer resistance\nto unionization are positively related to available quasi-rents per worker.\nHowever, there is still a strong negative trend in union organizing activity\nand a strong positive trend in employer resistance after controlling for\nquasi-rents per worker. Thus, the explanation for the decline in union\norganizing activity and the increase in employer resistance to unionization\nsince the mid 1970's lies elsewhere.\n\n",
