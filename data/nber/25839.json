    "abstract": "\n\nChinese local governments wield their enormous political power and administrative capacity to provide \u201cspecial deals\u201d for favored private firms. We argue that China\u2019s extraordinary economic growth comes from these special deals. Local political leaders do so because they derive personal benefits, either political or monetary, from providing special deals. Competition between local governments limits the predatory effects of special deals.\n\n",
