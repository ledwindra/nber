    "abstract": "\n\nIn this  paper we provide some evidence  that  repeat  taking of competitive  exams may reduce the impact of background disadvantages on educational outcomes.  Using administrative data  on the  university  entrance  exam in Turkey  we estimate  cumulative  learning between the first and the nth  attempt while controlling for selection into retaking in terms of observed and unobserved characteristics.  We find large learning gains measured in terms of improvements in the exam scores, especially among less advantaged students.\n\n",
