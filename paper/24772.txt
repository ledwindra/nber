ABSTRACT
In this paper, a structural gravity model is presented which features intra-sector heterogeneity in
agricultural productivity systematically linked to land and climate characteristics. The
“systematic heterogeneity” (SH) gravity model predicts that countries with similar land and
climate characteristics tend to specialize in the same agricultural products. Agricultural trade
flow elasticities then depend on comparative advantage, with larger-magnitude trade flow
responses predicted among countries more likely to specialize in similar agricultural products and
thus compete head-to-head in foreign markets. This is in contrast to standard log-linear gravity
models, which impose a restrictive pattern of trade flow elasticities that depend only on absolute
advantage in the agricultural sector. We also show how the SH gravity model can accommodate
product-specific trade costs. This allows the model to analyze changes in the dispersion of trade
costs across products. Such analysis cannot be carried out in a standard gravity model, in which
trade costs are assumed constant. Our results confirm economically and statistically significant
heterogeneity in the effects of the variables that typically proxy for trade costs in gravity models
and demonstrate that the SH gravity model is able to overcome the limitations imposed by the
restrictive pattern of elasticities in a standard gravity model.

Gravity and Comparative Advantage: Estimation of Trade Elasticities for the
Agricultural Sector

1. Introduction
The gravity model is a workhorse of applied international trade analysis. However, standard
gravity models derived from a structural relationship in the most common trade models
impose a restrictive pattern on the elasticity of bilateral trade flows with respect to changes
in trade costs, which Heerman, Arita and Gopinath (2015) refer to as the Independence of
Irrelevant Exporters (IIE) property. In models that feature the IIE property, the magnitude
of the response of a country’s export flows to a competitor’s trade costs depends only on its
absolute advantage in agriculture, irrespective of whether the competitor is likely to
specialize in similar agricultural products. This is a particularly strong assumption in
agriculture, where fundamental characteristics of climate and geography have a strong
influence on the specific set of products in which a country has comparative advantage and
thus the set of countries against which it competes most intensely.
We present a structural gravity model, the systematic heterogeneity (SH) gravity model,
which features intra-sector heterogeneity in productivity linked to land and climate
characteristics.

The model predicts that countries with similar land and climate

characteristics will systematically tend to specialize in the same products. Trade flow
elasticities then depend on comparative advantage, with larger-magnitude predicted trade
flow responses among countries more likely to specialize in similar products and thus
compete head-to-head in foreign markets.

1

A no-less advantageous additional benefit of the SH gravity model is that it can accommodate
product-specific trade costs. Transportation, marketing and other costs vary tremendously
and systematically across agricultural products due to differences in perishability and policy
treatment, among others. As such, the extent to which trade costs obscure comparative
advantage varies within the sector.
More practically, there is great demand for applied analysis of the production and trade
implications of changes in agricultural policy. Although the agricultural sector represents a
small share of the global economy, it is often pivotal in international trade relations. In the
context of international negotiations, agricultural policy issues are typically considered at
the product level. The SH gravity model’s ability to capture changes in the distribution of
trade costs across products is thus a substantial asset.
The SH gravity model specifies the relationship between trade flows and trade costs as a
random coefficients logit model (Berry, 1994 and Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes, 1995).
Therefore, our empirical approach is similar to the “mixed CES” model introduced in Adao,
Costinot and Donaldson (2017). This is more complex than the linear methods used to
estimate the standard gravity model. However, it requires little additional data.
In the next section we elaborate on the features of the standard structural gravity model that
impose restrictions on trade elasticities and the implications of those restrictions. Next we
present the SH gravity model, describe our data and estimation technique, and carry out a
test that finds that the IIE property does not hold in agricultural trade data. Finally, we
present the results of our model and demonstrate its ability to overcome the restrictions of
the standard gravity model.

2. Background
Until recently, the conventional view in international economics was that the gravity
equation lacked microeconomic foundations (Head and Mayer, 2014). However, it is now
considered general enough to be applied beyond a sub-set of countries or sectors (Eaton and
Kortum, 2002; Anderson and Wincoop, 2003; Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodríguez-Clare,
2012), and that importer and exporter fixed effects can be used to account for the
multilateral trade resistance terms derived from different theoretical models (Feenstra,
2004). In addition, evaluating a standard gravity equation on the basis of exports (imports)
to (by) country n, at the firm/industry/sector-level as opposed to the economy-wide level
using bilateral trade, has a clear analytical justification, drawing on a range of trade theories,
e.g., Melitz (2003); Anderson and Wincoop (2004); Chaney (2008); Anderson and Yotov
(2010a; 2010b; 2012); Costinot, Donaldson, and Komunjer (2012); and Costinot and
Rodríguez-Clare (2014). As a result, robust estimation of firm/industry/sector-level gravity
equations using export (import) data is now common in the agricultural economics
literature, some recent applications including: Reimer and Li (2010) (crop trade);
Jayasinghe, Beghin, and Moschini (2010) (US corn seed exports); Cardamone (2011) (fruit
exports); Chevassus-Lozza and Latouche (2012) (French firms’ agri-food exports); Xu
(2015) (agricultural trade); and Dal Bianco et al. (2016) (wine exports).
An important characteristic of the range of structural gravity models is that the quantitative
implications that can be drawn from them are very dependent upon a key parameter: the
elasticity of trade with respect to trade frictions such as tariffs (Simonovska and Waugh,
2014). Arkolakis et al. (2012) argue that the elasticity of trade, denoted as  , is one of two

3

sufficient statistics necessary for calculating the welfare effects of trade, the other being the
share of expenditure within a specific country on domestically produced goods denoted as

 . They show that the change in a country’s real income, Wˆ =W  /W , resulting from say a
reduction in trade costs can be calculated as Wˆ = λˆ1/ε , where ˆ    /  is the change in the
share of domestic expenditure on imports. Importantly, changes in welfare are independent
of the class of trade model, i.e., the source of the gains from trade depends on the type of
trade model being estimated, but the aggregate gains from trade do not. Arkolakis et al.
(2012) show that the welfare formula can be derived from three different structures: an
Armington model (see Anderson and Wincoop, 2003), a Ricardian model (see Eaton and
Kortum, 2002), and a heterogeneous firms model (see Melitz, 2003), where the margin of
adjustment occurs respectively through consumption, reallocation of labor across sectors,
and reallocation across firms within sectors.
For this equivalence result to hold, Arkolakis et al. (2012) impose a key restriction on the
partial elasticities: the import demand system is CES. Given the elasticities capture the
percentage change in relative imports by country n from country i given a change in trade
costs τ ni , the CES assumption implies that: there is a symmetric impact on relative demand
𝑋𝑛𝑖 /𝑋𝑛𝑛 for imports by n for all exporters i  n ; and, any change in a third country’s trade
costs τ ni  has the same proportional impact on X ni and X nn . In other words, changes in
relative demand depend only on changes in trade costs τ ni . Given this result, Arkolakis et al.
(2012) show that these effects can be recovered from a simple logarithmic gravity equation,
the estimated parameter for changes in trade costs being treated as an estimate of the trade

4

elasticity  , and the change in real income of country n due to the trade shock being
estimated as, Wˆn = λˆn1/ε , irrespective of the margin of adjustment.
Turning to trade in agricultural products, we argue that the CES assumption is overly
restrictive, i.e., the elasticity of each exporter i’s trade flows with respect to a given
competitor’s, i , trade flows is constant and directly proportional to the exporter’s market
share in n, irrespective of whether or not i competes with i . As noted earlier, Heerman et
al. (2015), refer to this restriction as the IIE property, i.e., changes in a third country’s trade
costs τ ni  are “irrelevant” to the ratio of any two competitors’ market share in a given import
market n. The results of Arkolakis et al. (2012) indicate that IIE is implicitly imposed in trade
models such as Eaton and Kortum (2002), Melitz (2003) and Anderson and Wincoop (2003).
Heerman et al. (2015) argue that the IIE property is very unlikely to hold in the case of
agricultural trade due to characteristics of natural endowments (land, soil, and climate) and
production requirements being non-random drivers of comparative advantage within the
agricultural sector. Consequently, econometric results assuming IIE will likely be imprecise,
and any predictions about the effect of changes in trade costs on bilateral agricultural trade
and production patterns, along with any estimated welfare effects, may be quite misleading.
Likewise, Adao et al. (2017) weaken the IIE restriction in order to allow exporters that are
similar in terms of defined characteristics such as GDP per capita, to be closer substitutes in
international trade.
For example, suppose we consider the fact that the United States has recently chosen not to
ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement (FTA), but that the
remaining 11 countries have chosen to proceed with the FTA. An expected benefit of TPP
5

for U.S. agricultural sector would have been increased access to the Japanese market
(Burfisher et al., 2014), but as a result of its withdrawal, Japanese tariff reductions will only
be offered to remaining member countries such as Australia, Canada and Malaysia. If the IIE
property holds, the reduction in agricultural tariffs under TPP would imply that Japanese
buyers substitute to Australian, Canadian and Malaysian products and away from its nonTPP trading partners such as the United States in a constant and direct proportion to their
initial market shares. However, this makes little sense if we consider that Australia, Canada
and the United States have similar land endowments and climate characteristics, and
therefore systematically specialize in a similar set of agricultural products, which contrasts
with Malaysia which has little available land and has a tropical climate. Consequently, one
would expect that exclusion from TPP will result in the United States losing a proportionately
larger market share in Japan relative to Australia and Canada than it will lose relative to
Malaysia.
In the context of this paper, the focus is on an extension of Eaton and Kortum (2002). The
latter assumes that comparative advantage within manufacturing is a function of a random
productivity variable that is independently distributed across products in the sector.
Specifically, no two countries are more likely to compete against each other exporting the
same products than any other country, i.e., the IIE property is assumed to hold. Extensions
of Eaton and Kortum (2002) to multisector analysis by, inter alia, Burstein and Vogel (2010),
Chor (2010), Costinot et al. (2012), Shikher (2011, 2012), Caliendo and Parro (2015), Tombe
(2015), and Kerr (2017) implicitly recognize the limitation of this assumption, allowing
average productivity, and in some cases the dispersion of productivity to vary across sectors,
generating non-random patterns of trade specialization across sectors and sub-sectors.
6

However, these models still maintain the assumption of random heterogeneity within each
sector or sub-sector, the IIE property holding at that level. In addition, there are practical
limitations to a multi sub-sector approach within agriculture (Heerman, 2013). First, the
researcher has to be able to define sub-sectors of like products such that specialization of a
country within that sub-sector can be assumed to be randomly determined ex ante. For
example, Reimer and Li (2010) focused on trade in crop agriculture, a well-defined subsector, but this still ignores the fact that agricultural product-specific farm and trade policies
may be enough to distort any underlying forces of comparative advantage for crops that are
substitutes in production.

Second, disaggregation requires a dependent variable

constructed from matching bilateral trade and production data for each subsector, and in the
case of agriculture, where many products are thinly traded, zero trade flows can easily
dominate available observations.
The key departure in this paper is the introduction of systematic heterogeneity into the
agricultural sector. Specifically, the likelihood a country has a comparative advantage in a set
of products depends not only on a randomly drawn technological productivity-augmenting
parameter, but also a set of country and product-specific characteristics including land and
climate. For example, agricultural R&D in the United States might generate a diseaseresistant variety of bananas, but the land and climate requirements for growing bananas
means the United States is unlikely to be a competitive exporter, and would therefore not be
affected by any changes in the banana-importing regime of the European Union (EU).
Alternatively, the United States has a technological advantage in producing geneticallymodified corn for which it also has the appropriate land and climate requirements, and it
could face increased competition in the Mexican export market from close competitors like
7

Brazil if market access for U.S. agriculture were to become more-costly as a result of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations. Fally and Sayre (2018)
likewise allow heterogeneous natural resource productivity in commodities to influence
comparative advantage. In contrast to our approach, which explicitly links a product’s
productivity in a common factor, viz., land, to country and product characteristics, in their
model each commodity is produced with a specific natural resource.
Allowing for systematic heterogeneity also means that trade costs may vary across products
and countries within sectors. This matters in agriculture where trade costs can differ
significantly due to the intrinsic characteristics of products and/or the types of trade and
other policies applied to those products. For example, compared to Brazil, the United States
has very low trade costs of exporting corn and soybeans to Mexico, partly due to
geographical proximity, but also because it has a very efficient storage and transportation
system that minimizes the cost of spillage etc. So any increase in trade barriers to Mexican
imports from the United States would be partially mitigated by the higher costs of importing
more corn and soybeans from Brazil. Likewise, the costs of the United States exporting
processed pork products to Mexico will have higher handling costs than corn due to the risks
of perishability and the need for refrigerated transportation. Importantly, the relative
difference between these advantages are not likely to be constant.
Trade policies also vary significantly across countries, with average MFN applied tariff rates
in agriculture ranging from 1.2 percent in Australia, through 33.5 percent in India, to 66.7
percent in Egypt (Bagwell, Bown and Staiger, 2016). These average differences in tariffs can
be captured in standard gravity models, but hide significant differences across products.

8

Applied agricultural tariffs exhibit a good deal of heterogeneity across both products and
countries. For example, Jales et al. (2005) report that developed countries typically have a
number of very high agricultural tariffs and a large number of low tariffs, implying low mean
tariffs with a high degree of tariff dispersion. By contrast, developing countries tend to have
higher mean agricultural tariffs, and less tariff dispersion. In the case of tariff-rate quotas
(TRQs), 1,400 have been introduced since 1995, with over-and in-quota tariffs averaging 123
and 63 percent respectively (Jales et al., 2005).
3. The Model
The SH gravity model environment is comprised of 𝐼 countries engaged in bilateral trade.
Importers are indexed by 𝑛 and exporters by 𝑖. The agricultural sector consists of a
continuum of products indexed by 𝑗 ∈ [0,1]. To produce quantity 𝑞𝑖 ( 𝑗) of product 𝑗 requires
labor (𝑁𝑖 ), land (𝐿𝑖 ), and intermediate inputs 𝑄𝑖 combined according to the function:
Equation 1
𝛼

𝛽
𝑞𝑖 (𝑗) = 𝑧𝑖 (𝑗)(𝑁𝑖 (𝑎𝑖 (𝑗)𝐿𝑖 )1−𝛽 ) 𝑄𝑖 1−𝛼

where 𝑧𝑖 ( 𝑗) represents product 𝑗-specific technological productivity and 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝑗) represents
product 𝑗-specific land productivity. Technological productivity is modeled as an
independently distributed Fréchet random variable with mean parameter 𝑇𝑖 and dispersion
parameter 𝜃 as in Eaton and Kortum (2002). Exporters with high values of 𝑇𝑖 have a greater
probability of a high realization of 𝑧𝑖 ( 𝑗) for any given agricultural product.

9

Product-specific land productivity, 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝑗), reflects the suitability of exporter 𝑖’s environment
for product 𝑗. We assume 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝑗) follows a parametric density that is a deterministic function
of exporter 𝑖’s agro-ecological characteristics and product 𝑗’s production requirements. For
example, countries with a climate like Ecuador will systematically tend to have higher values
of 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝑗) for 𝑗=bananas.
Markets are perfectly competitive. The price offered by exporter 𝑖 for product 𝑗 in market 𝑛
is therefore equal to the unit cost of producing in country 𝑖 and marketing in country 𝑛.
Exporters face additional costs, 𝜏𝑛𝑖 ( 𝑗) > 1 to sell product 𝑗 in import market 𝑛. Trade costs
are assumed to take the iceberg form, with 𝜏𝑛𝑛 ( 𝑗) = 1 and 𝜏𝑛𝑖 ( 𝑗) ≥ 𝜏𝑛𝑙 ( 𝑗)𝜏𝑙𝑖 ( 𝑗). We
assume 𝜏𝑛𝑖 ( 𝑗) follows a parametric density across products that is a deterministic function
of product-specific policies and other marketing requirements. Productivity and trade cost
distributions are assumed independent of each other.
Trade occurs as buyers in each import market seek out the lowest price offer for each
product. Heerman (2013) shows that for an individual product, the probability exporter 𝑖
offers the lowest price in market 𝑛 is:
Equation 2
𝑇𝑖 (𝑎̃𝑖 (𝑗)𝑐𝑖 𝜏𝑛𝑖 (𝑗))−𝜃
𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗) = 𝐼
∑𝑙=1 𝑇𝑙 (𝑎̃𝑙 (𝑗)𝑐𝑙 𝜏𝑛𝑙 (𝑗))−𝜃
Exporter 𝑖’s total share of importer market 𝑛 agricultural expenditure is the unconditional
probability it offers the lowest price for an agricultural product:

10

Equation 3

Pr(𝑝𝑛𝑖 (𝑗) = 𝑝𝑛 (𝑗)) ≡ 𝜋𝑛𝑖

where 𝑎̃𝑖 (𝑗) = 𝑎𝑖 (𝑗)−𝛼

joint density of 𝒂
consumed in import market 𝑛. Equation 3 is a gravity-like relationship between market
share on the one hand and exporter characteristics and bilateral trade costs on the other. It
is a weighted sum of 𝜋𝑛𝑖 ( 𝑗), where the weights reflect the importance of each product in
market 𝑛 consumption.
An expression equivalent to Equation 3 can also be derived from a demand-side model, as in
the structural gravity equation outlined in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and others. In
that case 𝑇𝑖 is a share parameter that is an outcome of the Armington assumption and −𝜃 =
1 − 𝜎, where 𝜎 is the elasticity of substitution (Anderson and Yotov, 2010a). In a demand
side setting, the parameter 𝑎𝑖 (𝑗) could be used to represent product-specific preferences
linked to characteristics of product 𝑗 produced in country 𝑖. We leave the details of this
extension for future work.
Trade Elasticity
Heerman et al. (2015) shows that in the SH gravity model, elasticity of market share with
respect to a change in bilateral trade costs between exporter 𝑖 and the importing country 𝑛
can be written:

11

Equation 4

𝜕𝜋𝑛𝑖 𝜏𝑛𝑙
=
𝜕𝜏𝑛𝑙 𝜋𝑛𝑖

−𝜃 ((1 − 𝜋𝑛𝑖 ) −

1
𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗)))
𝜋𝑛𝑖

𝜃
(𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗), 𝜋𝑛𝑙 (𝑗)) + 𝜋𝑛𝑖 × 𝜋𝑛𝑙 )
{𝜋𝑛𝑖

𝑙=𝑖
𝑙≠𝑖

Elasticities depend on cross-product differences in 𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗), with 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗)) and
𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗), 𝜋𝑛𝑙 (𝑗)) functions of the distributions of 𝑎𝑖 (𝑗) and 𝜏𝑛𝑖 (𝑗). The direct effect of lower
bilateral trade costs is decreasing in 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗)). This implies that market share is less
elastic for exporters that specialize in products for which competition is less intense, or for
which trade costs remain high. The indirect effect of a change in a competitor’s bilateral
trade costs is increasing in 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗), 𝜋𝑛𝑙 (𝑗)). The indirect elasticity will therefore be larger
among competitors with similar distributions of 𝑎𝑖 (𝑗), and further augmented when 𝜏𝑛𝑖 (𝑗) is
also similar.
In a standard gravity model 𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗) = 𝜋𝑛𝑖 : The probability of comparative advantage in an
individual product does not depend on product or exporter characteristics. Every exporter
is thus equally likely to offer the lowest price in every agricultural product and 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗)) =
𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝜋𝑛𝑖 (𝑗), 𝜋𝑛𝑙 (𝑗)) = 0. Therefore, trade elasticities are a constant proportion of market
share.

𝜕𝜋𝑛𝑖 𝜏𝑛𝑙
−𝜃(1 − 𝜋𝑛; )

𝜕𝜏𝑛𝑙 𝜋𝑛𝑖

These elasticities are a representation of the IIE property, which is imposed in every
structural gravity model derived from a trade model that assumes a CES import demand
system.
4. Specification and Data
We estimate parameters of the productivity and trade cost distributions for agriculture as in
Heerman et al. (2015) by specifying Equation 3 as a random coefficients logit model. We
begin as in Eaton and Kortum (2002) by defining 𝑆𝑖 = ln(𝑇𝑖 ) − 𝜃 ln(𝑐𝑖 ). This is exporter 𝑖’s
average technological productivity adjusted for unit production costs.
Land Productivity Distribution
We specify 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝑗) as a parametric function of exporter land and climate characteristics and
product land and climate requirements:
Equation 6
𝑙𝑛(𝑎𝑖 ( 𝑗)) = 𝑿𝑖 𝜹( 𝑗) = 𝑿𝑖 𝜹 + 𝑿𝑖 (𝑬( 𝑗)𝚲)′ + 𝑿𝑖 (𝜈𝐸 ( 𝑗)𝚺𝐸 )′
where 𝑿𝑖 is a 1 × 𝑘 vector of variables describing country 𝑖’s characteristics; 𝜹 is a 𝑘 × 1
vector of coefficients; 𝑬( 𝑗) is a 1 × 𝑚 vector of product 𝑗-specific production requirements
that can be observed and quantified; 𝚲 is an 𝑚 × 𝑘 matrix of coefficients that describes how
the relationship between elements of 𝑿𝑖 and land productivity varies across products with
𝑬( 𝑗); and 𝝂𝐸 ( 𝑗) is a 1 × 𝑘 vector that captures the effect of unobservable product 𝑗-specific
requirements with matrix 𝚺𝑬 .
We specify three types of exporter characteristics, climate, elevation and agricultural land:

13

𝑿𝑖 = [𝑎𝑙𝑖

𝑒𝑙𝑣𝑖

𝑡𝑟𝑝𝑖

𝑡𝑚𝑝𝑖

𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑖 ]

where 𝑎𝑙𝑖 is the log of arable land per capita, 𝑒𝑙𝑣𝑖 is the share of rural land between 800 and
3000 meters above sea level, and the remaining elements are the shares of total land area in
tropical, temperate, and boreal climate zones. The vector 𝑗 = [𝑬( 𝑗) 𝝂𝑬 ( 𝑗)] defines
products in terms of their suitability for production under the conditions defined by 𝑿𝑖 .
We define:
𝑬( 𝑗) = [𝑎𝑙𝑤( 𝑗) 𝑒𝑙𝑣( 𝑗) 𝑡𝑟𝑝( 𝑗) 𝑡𝑚𝑝( 𝑗) 𝑏𝑜𝑟( 𝑗)]
where 𝑎𝑙𝑤( 𝑗) describes product- 𝑗 land requirements, 𝑒𝑙𝑣( 𝑗) captures its elevation
requirements, and 𝑡𝑟𝑝( 𝑗), 𝑡𝑚𝑝( 𝑗), and 𝑏𝑜𝑟( 𝑗) describe climate requirements. These
variables relate exporter 𝑖’s characteristics to absolute advantage in agriculture through 𝑿𝑖 𝜹,
and describe how they systematically influence the set of products within the agricultural
sector in which it has comparative advantage through 𝑿𝑖 (𝑬( 𝑗)𝚲)′.
Note that we define the land intensity of product 𝑗 production using data on land per
agricultural worker, whereas we use agricultural land per capita in 𝑿𝑖 . Elements of 𝑿𝑖
represent the factors that influence exporter 𝑖’s potential comparative advantage, whereas
elements of 𝑬( 𝑗) represent the ideal conditions under which product 𝑗 is produced.
Trade Cost Distribution
We specify product- 𝑗 trade costs as:
Equation 7
𝑙𝑛(𝜏𝑛𝑖 ( 𝑗)) = 𝒕𝑛𝑖 𝜷( 𝑗) = 𝒕𝑛𝑖 𝜷 + 𝑒𝑥𝑖 + 𝒕𝑛𝑖 (𝝂𝑡𝑛 ( 𝑗)𝚺𝑡 )′ + 𝜉𝑛𝑖

14

where 𝒕𝑛𝑖 is a 1 × 𝑚 vector describing the relationship between exporter 𝑖 and import
market 𝑛, 𝜷 is an 𝑚 × 1 vector of parameters; 𝑒𝑥𝑖 is an exporter-specific trade cost captured
by a fixed effect as in Waugh (2010); 𝝂𝑡𝑛 ( 𝑗) is a 1 × 𝑚 vector that captures the effect of
unobservable product 𝑗-specific trade costs with scaling matrix 𝚺𝒕 , and 𝜉𝑛𝑖 captures
unobservable or unquantifiable bilateral trade costs that are common across products and
orthogonal to the regressors.
We define:
𝒕𝑛𝑖 = [𝑏𝑛𝑖

𝑙𝑛𝑖

𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑖

𝒅𝑛𝑖 ]

where 𝑏𝑛𝑖 , 𝑙𝑛𝑖 and 𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑖 equal one if the two countries share a common border or language
or are members of a common regional free trade agreement. The 1 × 6 vector 𝒅𝑛𝑖 assigns
each country pair to one of six distance categories as defined in Eaton and Kortum (Table 1).

Estimating Productivity and Trade Cost Distribution Parameters
Using our definitions of 𝑎𝑖 ( 𝑗) and 𝜏𝑛𝑖 ( 𝑗) in Equation 3, we obtain a random coefficients logit
model of agricultural market share:

15

Equation 8

𝜋𝑛𝑖 = ∫

exp{𝑆𝑖 + 𝜃𝛼𝑖 (1 − 𝛽𝑖 )𝑿𝑖 𝜹(𝑗) − 𝜃𝒕𝑛𝑖 𝜷(𝑗)}
𝑑𝐹̂ (𝑬)𝑑𝐹̂ 𝝂𝑛 (𝝂)
∑𝐼𝑙=1{𝑆𝑖 + 𝜃𝛼𝑙 (1 − 𝛽𝑙 )𝑿𝑙 𝜹(𝑗) − 𝜃𝒕𝑛𝑙 𝜷(𝑗)} 𝐸𝑛

where 𝑑𝐹̂𝐸𝑛 (𝑬)𝑑𝐹̂ 𝝂𝑛 (𝝂) is the empirical density of products imported by market 𝑛 defined
jointly by their land and climate characteristics, unobserved agro-ecological requirements
and trade costs. We estimate Equation 8 using a simulated method of moments approach
similar to that in Berry et al., (1995), which is detailed in Nevo (2000) and Train (2009). To
evaluate the integral, we use the “smooth simulator” suggested by Nevo (2000):
Equation 9

where 𝑆̃𝑖 = 𝑆𝑖 + 𝜃𝛼𝑖 (1 − 𝛽𝑖 )𝑿𝒊 𝜹 is a country fixed effect. We use the minimum distance
procedure suggested by Nevo (2000) to obtain 𝑆̂𝑖 and 𝜹 from 𝑆̃̂𝑖 .
Data
Parameters of the productivity and trade cost distributions are estimated using production
and trade data from 2006. Bilateral market shares (𝜋𝑛𝑖 ) are calculated by dividing bilateral
import value by total domestic expenditure, calculated as the sum of production value and
net exports. Domestic market share is calculated as 𝜋𝑛𝑛 = 1 − ∑𝑖≠𝑛 𝜋𝑛𝑖 . Our data consists
of a sample of 63 countries and 134 agricultural items for which data on both bilateral trade
and the gross value of production in U.S. dollars are available (FAO, 2013). These are mostly
primary agricultural products. Elements of 𝒕𝑛𝑖 are obtained from the CEPII gravity data set

(Head, Mayer and Ries, 2009). While land and climate requirements for each product are
not directly observable to the economist, we do observe conditions of their production
around the world.
We therefore use observable characteristics of exporting countries to construct “observable”
product requirements matrix 𝑬( 𝑗) for each of the 𝐽 = 134 items for which the FAO
publishes both production and trade data. This approach is valid under two assumptions:
First, 𝑬( 𝑗) is distributed across products following the empirical distribution of
requirements for agricultural products defined at the “item” level by the FAO. Second,
exporting is positively correlated with high values of 𝑎𝑖 (𝑗). We measure 𝑒𝑙𝑣( 𝑗) and 𝑎𝑙𝑤( 𝑗)
as in Heerman et al. (2015) as the export-weighted average of exporters’ share of land at
high elevation (𝑒𝑙𝑣𝑖 ) and arable land per agricultural worker (𝑎𝑙𝑤𝑖 ) using data on arable land
per agricultural worker from World Bank (2012) and elevation data from CIESIN (2010),
respectively.
A drawback of defining product requirements as export-weighted averages of country
characteristics is that it is not very precise. Many important agricultural exporters have
varied terrain and climate within their borders. For example, roughly 20 percent of global
wheat exports originated in Canada in 2006. However, while a large share of total Canadian
land area is in the boreal climate zone, its wheat production is concentrated in temperate
regions. A trade-weighted average of climate distributions thus misrepresents wheat’s
climate requirements.
We are able to improve on the measurement of product-specific climate requirements used
in Heerman et al. (2015), taking advantage of information on product-specific production
17

across climate zones within countries provided by the GTAP land use database (Lee et al.,
2005). As part of an effort to model the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector,
the database provides estimates of land rent for ten product categories in 18 agro-ecological
zones (AEZs) within in each of several countries.
An AEZ is a defined zone based on soil, landform and climactic characteristics. A country’s
estimated land rent in AEZ 𝑥 for crop 𝑦 is calculated by by apportioning the crop’s total land
rent across AEZ’s in proportion to its share in the value of crop 𝑦 production. To calculate
product climate requirements, we assign each of the crops in our data set to one of the ten
GTAP aggregates. We then calculate the share of land rent in each zone and aggregate these
shares into a distribution of land rent across tropical, temperate and boreal climate zones
for each product, country pair. Finally, we define product 𝑗 climate requirements as the
export-weighted average of these land rent distributions. The GTAP land use database does
not calculate a distribution of land rent across climate zones for animal products. We use
export-weighted averages of country climate distributions, as we did for land and elevation
intensity, to calculate [𝑡𝑟𝑝( 𝑗)

𝑡𝑚𝑝( 𝑗) 𝑏𝑜𝑟( 𝑗)] for these products.

The 𝑛𝑠 = 900 products used to evaluate Equation 9 for each importer and its trading
partners are drawn from 𝑑𝐹̂𝐸𝑛 (𝑬)𝑑𝐹̂ 𝝂𝑛 (𝝂). We construct this density as in Heerman et al.
(2015), first using FAO item level import data to estimate 𝑑𝐹̂𝐸𝑛 (𝑬), the empirical distribution
of 𝑬( 𝑗) across products imported by each market by compiling a list of 1000 imported items
defined by the vector 𝑬( 𝑗) for each market 𝑛. Unique values of 𝑬( 𝑗) are represented in
𝑑𝐹̂𝐸𝑛 (𝑬) in proportion to the associated FAO item’s share in total imports. That is, if 15% of
importer 𝑛’s total agricultural imports are of the FAO item “wheat”, then 𝐸(𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡) makes
18

up 150 entries on 𝑑𝐹̂𝐸𝑛 (𝑬). Next we draw values of 𝑬( 𝑗) using uniform draws from each
country’s distribution. The distribution is completed by associating each item on the list
with 𝜈𝑛 ( 𝑗) = [𝝂𝑬 (𝑗) 𝝂𝒕𝒏 (𝑗)] drawn from a standard multivariate normal distribution,
effectively generating a “data set” of 900 unique products imported by each market.
5. A Test for the IIE Property
If the IIE property holds in the data, the standard gravity model adequately captures trade
elasticities and welfare can be calculated following the simple approach described in
Arkolakis et al. (2012). That is, when all heterogeneity can be assumed independent,
Equation 3 becomes:
Equation 10

Pr(𝑝𝑛𝑖 (𝑗) = 𝑝𝑛 (𝑗)) ≡ 𝜋𝑛𝑖 =

𝑇𝑖 (𝑐𝑖 𝜏𝑛𝑖 )−𝜃
∑𝐼𝑙=1 𝑇𝑙 (𝑐𝑙 𝜏𝑛𝑙 )−𝜃

The ratio 𝜋𝑛𝑖 /𝜋𝑛𝑛 can then be log-linearized, delivering a standard gravity model. Using the
trade cost specification described above, this is:
Equation 11
𝜋𝑛𝑖
ln (
) = 𝑆𝑖 − 𝑆𝑛 − 𝜃𝛼𝑖 (1 − 𝛽𝑖 )𝑿𝑖 𝜹 − 𝜃𝒕𝑛𝑖 𝜷
𝜋𝑛𝑛
A test of whether the IIE property holds in the data is suggested by those developed for its
demand-side parallel, the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) (Greene 2003).
McFadden and Train (2000) describe a test that can be used to evaluate whether IIE holds in
our agricultural trade data. The idea behind this test is that if all heterogeneity in price offers

19

is independently distributed, market shares should be uncorrelated across exporters and
deviations from average trade costs will not have a statistically significant impact on bilateral
market share. The formal hypothesis is that market share can be represented by Equation
10 against the alternative that comparative advantage is not independently distributed
across products.
To conduct the test, parameter estimates from Equation 11 are used to calculate estimated
market shares 𝜋̂𝑛𝑖 . These estimates are then used to construct artificial variables, which take
the form:
𝑧𝑛𝑖 =

1
(𝑡𝑛𝑖 − 𝑡𝑛 )2
2

where 𝑡𝑛 = ∑𝐼𝑙=1 𝑡𝑛𝑙 𝜋̂𝑛𝑙 and 𝑡𝑛𝑖 is an element of 𝒕𝑛𝑖 . McFadden and Train (2000) show that if
the coefficients on these artificial variables are jointly insignificant, the null hypothesis that
heterogeneity is independently distributed across products cannot be rejected. We calculate
artificial variables for border, language, distance and RTA and then estimate:
Equation 12
10

𝜋𝑛𝑖
ln (
) = 𝑆𝑖 − 𝑆𝑛 − 𝜃𝛼𝑖 (1 − 𝛽𝑖 )𝑿𝑖 𝜹 − 𝜃𝒕𝑛𝑖 𝜷 + ∑(𝑧𝑛𝑖 𝑑 − 𝑧𝑛𝑛 𝑑 )𝛽𝑑
𝜋𝑛𝑛
𝑑=1

where 𝑿𝒊 and 𝒕𝒏𝒊 are defined as above and 𝑧𝑛𝑖 𝑑 is the artificial variable constructed from the
𝑑 𝑡ℎ element of the vector of trade cost variables for exporter 𝑖 in market 𝑛 and 𝛽𝑑 is the
corresponding coefficient. A test of the null hypothesis that the artificial variables are jointly
equal to zero is firmly rejected at any reasonable level of significance with an 𝐹-statistic
equal to 8.62.

Coefficients on all climate variables are normalized to sum to zero. As such, coefficients on
exporter climate characteristics are interpreted with respect to the average climate, and the
effects of product-specific climate requirements are interpreted with respect to the average
production requirement. For example, the positive mean effect on tropical land share
(𝛿𝑡𝑟𝑝 = 0.7) implies that having a larger than average share of land in a tropical climate
increases agricultural market share on average. The positive and larger coefficient on 𝑡𝑟𝑝( 𝑗)
(𝜆𝑡𝑟𝑝,𝑡𝑟𝑝 = 6.86) implies this effect is increasing for products that are more intensively
tropical than average. A negative coefficient implies the advantage of tropical land is
decreasing for more intensively boreal products (𝜆𝑡𝑟𝑝,𝑏𝑜𝑟 = −7.4).
21

Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the total effect of high elevation land across the
products in our constructed data set. High elevation land decreases the probability of having
the lowest price for some products, but raises it for most. The positive mean effect on
elevation (𝛿𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣 = 1.14) implies that having more land at high elevation increases
agricultural market share on average. This advantage is greatly magnified for products
intensively produced at high elevations (𝑒𝑙𝑣(𝑗) = 47.96) and products that are more
intensely boreal than the average product (𝜆𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣,𝑏𝑜𝑟 = 11.01). It is diminished for products
more intensively produced in temperate climates than the average product (𝜆𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣,𝑡𝑚𝑝 =
−12.32). The statistically and economically insignificant value of the estimated coefficient
on unobservable differences in the effect of high elevation (𝜎𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣 = −0.21), implies that
variation in the effect is sufficiently explained by the product requirements in 𝑬( 𝑗).

Estimates for 𝑆̃̂𝑖 are listed in Table 7 in the Appendix. These values are normalized to sum to
zero and are thus interpreted as average sector-level productivity relative to the average

country, and in the average product. Recall that 𝑆̃̂𝑖 is increasing in average technological and
land productivity, but decreasing in costs of production 𝑐𝑖 . A country with high average
productivity may nevertheless have a small 𝑆̂𝑖 if it has, e.g., very high wages or land rental
rates.

Table 3 contains estimates for the trade cost distribution parameters 𝜷 and 𝚺𝒕 . Positive
coefficient values in 𝜷 imply higher trade costs, but lower expected market share. Elements
of 𝚺𝒕 capture heterogeneity in the effect of each element of 𝒕𝑛𝑖 across agricultural products
and can be interpreted like a standard error around the mean effect.

In the agricultural sector, positive mean effects imply that sharing a common language and
participating in an RTA increase market share on average, while negative coefficients imply
23

distance tends to decrease it. The negative mean effect of sharing a border (𝛽𝑏 = −1.76) is
counterintuitive. However, the relatively larger magnitude of the estimated standard error
(𝜎𝑏 = 3.13) implies sharing a border increases market share for some products and
decreases it for others. Sharing a border may reduce trade in individual products for a
number of reasons.

For example, domestic agricultural policies often systematically

advantage domestic producers relative to their close competitors.
Values of 𝑒𝑥
̂ 𝑖 are reported in Table 7 in the Appendix. The values are normalized to sum to
zero, so positive (negative) values imply that exporter 𝑖 is a lower (higher)-than-averagecost exporter. Our results suggest that Belgium, Canada and the United States are the lowestcost exporters in our data set.
Total Bilateral Trade Cost Distribution
As in a standard gravity model, bilateral trade costs vary across exporters depending upon
the characteristics in Table 3. In the SH gravity model, heterogeneity in the effect of these
characteristics captures additional variation across products. In Figure 2 we illustrate the
distribution of trade costs faced by two high income countries in the U.S. market. The figure
confirms that on average, Japanese products face higher costs to enter the U.S. market than
Canadian products. In addition to a difference in the location of the distribution, which can
be captured in a standard gravity model, higher moments of the distribution appear
markedly different. For Canada, trade costs are low on most products, but a few face very
high costs to enter the U.S. market. In contrast, trade costs facing Japanese imports are
distributed tightly around the median. This can be traced to the relatively large values for
the standard deviation around common border (𝜎𝑏 = 3.13) and the closest distance
24

categories (𝜎1 = 2.36, 𝜎2 = 2.33).

Differences in the distribution across products are

explained in part by differences in options for modes of transport from near versus far, but
also on regulatory and other policies that affect bilateral trade asymmetrically across
products and countries.

Elasticities
Parameter estimates in Table 2 and Table 3 allow us to calculate predicted market share
(Equation 9) and elasticities using the formulas underlying Equation 4.1 To see how the SH
gravity model overcomes the limitations of imposing the IIE property highlighted in
Arkolakis et al. (2012), we first show that the predicted elasticities are not a constant
proportion of market share, as the standard model predicts (Equation 5 ).
We calculate the ratio of the elasticity to Mexican trade costs to market share in Canada, that
𝜕𝜋

𝜏

is 𝜕𝜏 𝑛𝑖 𝜋𝑛𝑙 /𝜋𝑛𝑙 , where 𝑙 =Mexico, 𝑖 ≠ Mexico and 𝑛=Canada. Since the relevant elasticity is a

direct elasticity for 𝑖=Mexico, we divide Mexico’s own elasticity by (1 − 𝜋𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑀𝑒𝑥 ). This ratio
would be the same (equal to 𝜃) for every country in the standard model. In the SH model
the ratio varies dramatically depending on characteristics of the exporter and the products
they export to Canada. Table 4 reports this ratio for the countries with the largest share of
Canadian expenditure on the products in our data set. The SH gravity model predicts that
Colombia, Chile and Indonesia would gain disproportionately from higher Mexican trade
costs, whereas gains in Canadian and U.S. market share will be proportionately smaller.

As discussed earlier in this paper, Arkolakis et al. (2012) highlight two consequences of these
restrictive elasticities implied by the IIE property. First, an increase in 𝜏𝑛𝑖 has a symmetric
effect on relative expenditure (𝑋𝑛𝑖 /𝑋𝑛𝑛 ) for all countries regardless of the characteristics of
markets for the agricultural products they export. To illustrate how the SH gravity model
overcomes this restriction, we calculate the elasticity of 𝜋𝑛𝑖 with respect to 𝜏𝑛𝑖 for each
country 𝑖 and 𝑛 = Canada, and use it to calculate new values for relative market share,
′
𝜋𝑛𝑖
/𝜋𝑛𝑛 ′.

Although relative expenditure and relative market share are equivalent by

definition, we present our results in terms of market share since it is the object we calculate.

⁄𝜋 𝑛𝑖 for the foreign countries with the largest share of

Canadian expenditure in our data set. Again, whereas this value would be identical for every
country in the standard model, the SH model allows the response of relative demand to
changes in countries’ own trade costs to vary. Interestingly, the SH model finds that relative
market share generally declines less for countries with a larger initial share of the Canadian
market than for the median exporter. However, the value of the ratio does not decline
monotonically with market share. For example, a larger ratio (0.963 versus 0.960) suggests
that Indonesian exports face less head-to-head competition in the Canadian market than do
those of Chile, which represent a larger share of Canadian expenditure in the base model. A
particularly small decline suggests that U.S. exporters generally face less intense price
competition in the Canadian market.

This is a substantial advantage, likely due to

geographical and cultural proximity as well as trade preferences.

The second consequence discussed in Arkolakis et al. (2012) is that relative market share is
unaffected by a change in a third country’s trade costs. This is essentially a statement of the
27

IIE assumption and a straightforward parallel to the “red bus-blue bus problem” referenced
extensively in the literature on discrete choice demand systems.2 The standard gravity
model predicts that higher trade costs will drive Canadian buyers to substitute away from

Whereas the value of this ratio would be exactly equal to one for every country in the
standard gravity model, the SH model picks up variation, albeit small – the relative market

Train (2009) describes this famous problem of modeling consumer choice between traveling to work by blue
bus or by car. In a model that assumes the IIA, the introduction of a new red bus that is otherwise equivalent
to the blue bus will predict that consumers substitute toward the red bus in proportion to their use of the blue
bus and car.

share of the most responsive country increases by only 0.4 percent more than the least
responsive.3 However, the variation in elasticities is in the direction we expect: The SH
model predicts that Mexico’s neighbors with similar climates – Costa Rica and Honduras –
gain proportionately more from Mexico’s lost access. Larger changes in trade costs and
changes in the dispersion of trade costs can translate into more substantial differences in
predicted trade flows.
7. Conclusions
In this paper we have detailed two disadvantages of the standard gravity model for applied
analysis of agricultural trade and presented a tractable alternative, the SH gravity model. We
have shown that the SH gravity model can overcome the limitations on bilateral trade
elasticities embodied by the IIE property. We discuss the work of Arkolakis et al. (2012),
who explain that it is the assumption of a CES import demand system that delivers a gravitylike structural relationship in the most common trade models, but also imposes the IIE
property. The SH gravity model loosens the CES import demand system assumption while
maintaining a gravity-like structural relationship. The model is specified as a randomcoefficients logit model (Berry et al., 1995). Using interactions between exporter land and
climate characteristics and product land and climate production requirements, it identifies
countries likely to have comparative advantage in similar products. These countries’ trade
flows are then more elastic to each other’s trade costs.

Values less than one imply that domestic (Canadian) producers gain proportionately more market share than
the United States and Kazakhstan.
3

29

We have also shown how the SH gravity model can accommodate product-specific trade
costs. This allows the model to analyze changes in the dispersion of trade costs across
products. Such analysis cannot be carried out in a standard gravity model, in which trade
costs are assumed constant. Our results confirm economically and statistically significant
heterogeneity in the effects of the variables that typically proxy for trade costs in gravity
models.
In our ongoing work developing the SH gravity model, we seek to improve the model and its
general equilibrium extension on several fronts, with an explicit objective of enhancing its
usefulness for applied analysis of agricultural trade policy. First, in addition to updating the
trade and production data, we are exploring alternative approaches to constructing the
distribution of products consumed. Currently, we assume that the distribution of products
consumed is adequately represented by the distribution of imported products. However, if
high product-specific tariffs sufficiently limit imports of a given product, it will be underrepresented and the estimates of gains from reducing those tariffs will be under-estimated.
Second, we are gathering data and adapting the estimation methodology in order to
introduce observable sources of trade cost heterogeneity arising from policy differences like
tariffs and non-tariff measures, as well as from intrinsic characteristics like perishability.
Finally, we are pursuing methodological changes to improve product and sub-sector level
analysis within the model, allowing for a better understanding of the distributional
consequences of changes in trade costs.
