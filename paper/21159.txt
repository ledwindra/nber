ABSTRACT
Relying upon a standard New Keynesian DSGE, we propose an explanation for two empirical findings
in the international finance literature. First, the unbiasedness hypothesis – the proposition that expost
exchange rate depreciation matches interest differentials – is rejected much more strongly at short
horizons than at long. Second, even at long horizons, the unbiasedness hypothesis tends to be rejected
when one of the currencies has experienced a long period of low interest rates, such as in Japan and
Switzerland. Using a calibrated New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, we
show how a monetary policy rule can induce the negative (positive) correlation between depreciation
and interest differentials at short (long) horizons. The tendency to reject unbiasedness for Japan and
Switzerland even at long horizons we attribute to the interaction of the monetary reaction function
and the zero lower bound.

Abstract
Relying upon a standard New Keynesian DSGE, we propose an explanation for two empirical
findings in the international finance literature. First, the unbiasedness hypothesis — the proposition that expost exchange rate depreciation matches interest differentials — is rejected much
more strongly at short horizons than at long. Second, even at long horizons, the unbiasedness
hypothesis tends to be rejected when one of the currencies has experienced a long period of low
interest rates, such as in Japan and Switzerland. Using a calibrated New Keynesian dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium model, we show how a monetary policy rule can induce the negative (positive) correlation between depreciation and interest differentials at short (long) horizons.
The tendency to reject unbiasedness for Japan and Switzerland even at long horizons we attribute
to the interaction of the monetary reaction function and the zero lower bound.

Introduction

One of the most enduring empirical regularities in the international finance literature is the rejection
of the joint hypothesis of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) and rational expectations. According
to the unbiasedness hypothesis, the interest rate differential between two countries should be an
unbiased predictor of the change in the exchange rate between them. Chinn and Meredith (2004)
document the continued failure of the unbiasedness hypothesis to hold for horizons of up to a year.

But they also document that at horizons of greater than a year, the unbiasedness hypothesis holds
better, so that at the ten year horizon, the hypothesis cannot be rejected.
Chinn and Quayyum (2013) update the results in Chinn and Meredith, using data ranging up to
2012. They confirm the finding that unbiasedness holds better at longer horizons than at short.
Chinn and Meredith attribute their finding to the greater endogeneity of the short term rate,
given a Taylor-rule type central bank reaction function. They demonstrate that a Keynesian model
incorporating sticky prices and model consistent expectations and importantly a random shock in
the uncovered interest parity relation can replicate the pattern of unbiasedness rejections.
One key difference between the findings using the shorter and longer sample periods is that in the
sample encompassing the Great Recession, and the encounter with the zero lower bound (ZLB), the
tendency to reject the unbiasedness, even at the long horizon, increases. Even before the onset of the
financial crisis, several countries had short term interest rates near the zero interest bound. Perhaps
more importantly for our results, long term interest rates were particularly quite low in Japan and
Switzerland, two currencies for which the estimated is noticeably low.
At first glance, there is no particular reason why the unbiasedness hypothesis should not hold
when short and/or long term rates strike the zero interest bound, as expected exchange rate changes
could adjust to make the parity condition hold. However, it seems worthwhile to investigate the
sensitivity of the estimates to inclusion of the low-interest rate period. We arbitrarily define 1996Q1
as the low interest rate period for these two countries. Estimating the Fama regression on long horizon
data, allowing for a slope break at 1996Q1, indicates that post-1996 the unbiasedness relationship
breaks down, with the slope coefficient significantly different and negative in the latter period.
The advent of low long term interest rates in Japan and Switzerland is associated with the
attenuation of evidence for the unbiasedness hypothesis at the long horizon for currency pairs
involving these countries. However, it is not an explanation, as uncovered interest parity is an
arbitrage condition.
There are two key motivations for this paper. The first is to show that a conventional New
Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model can yield the implication that
under normal conditions, the long horizon Fama coefficient is positive, and greater than the short
horizon coefficient (which is typically negative) with only a minor modification. The second is to
demonstrate that when there is a substantial likelihood of encountering the zero lower bound (ZLB),
the long horizon Fama coefficient will be lower.
In the next section we briefly review unbiasedness hypothesis and new empirical results. In
Section 3, the model derivation is presented, and summarized in Section 3.11. In Section 4, the
model calibration is shown. Sections 5 and 6 present, respectively, the calibration results without
and with the zero lower bound. Section 7 concludes.

Theory and Literature

The UIP hypothesis states, if investors are risk neutral, and there are no barriers to cross-border
capital flows, then the return from investing a unit amount in a risk free bond in the home currency
for period k, it,k , should equal the expected return from converting the unit amount into foreign

2

currency and investing in risk free bond in foreign currency for period k, and converting the foreign
currency return back into home currency after period k.
Et st+k − st = (it,k − i∗t,k )

(1)

Obviously, this hypothesis is difficult to test since the market’s subjective expectation of the
exchange rate is unobservable. The typical recourse adopted by researchers is to adopt the rational
expectations hypothesis, so that the subjective market expectation equals the mathematical (conditional) expectation. Under the rational expectations hypothesis, the actual value of the future spot
rate equals the expected value of future spot rate plus an error term,
st+k = Et st+k + εt+k

(2)

where εt+k is an expectation error that is orthogonal to everything that is known at time t. This
yields:
st+k − st = (it,k − i∗t,k ) + εt+k
(3)
The resulting unbiasedness hypothesis is usually tested using the following specification, often referred
to as the Fama regression (Fama, 1984):
st+k − st = α + β(it,k − i∗t,k ) + ζt+k

(4)

where the expected value of β according to the hypothesis is 1. The maintained hypothesis is the
null hypothesis, and under the unbiasedness null, the error ζt+k is merely the expectations error, and
is orthogonal to the interest rate differential, it,k − i∗t,k . (Under the alternative, ζt+k could be an error
term that does not fulfill the rational expectations criteria, and/or a time varying risk premium,
possibly correlated with the interest differential.) In the regressions reported in this paper, the exact
formulas are used instead of the log approximations.
Note that the intercept α may be non zero while testing for UIP using equation (4). A non
zero may reflect a constant risk premium (hence, we are really testing for a time-varying risk
premium, rather than risk neutrality per se) and/or approximation errors stemming from Jensens
Inequality from the fact that expectation of a ratio (the exchange rate) is not equal to the ratio of
the expectation.
Most of the studies fall into the category employing the rational expectations hypothesis; in our
lexicon, that means they are tests of the unbiasedness hypothesis. Estimates of equation (4) using
values for k that range up to one year typically reject the unbiasedness restriction on the slope
parameter. The widely cited 1990 survey by Froot and Thaler finds an average estimate for β of
-0.881 . Bansal and Dahlquist (2000) provide more mixed results, when examining a broader set of
advanced and emerging market currencies. They also note that the failure of unbiasedness appears
to depend upon whether the US interest rate is above or below the foreign2 . Frankel and Poonawala
1
Similar results are cited in surveys by MacDonald and Taylor (1992) and Isard (1995). Meese and Rogoff (1983)
show that the forward rate is outpredicted by a random walk, which is consistent with the failure of the unbiasedness
hypothesis.
2
Flood and Rose (1996, 2002) note that including currency crises and devaluations, one finds more evidence for the
unbiasedness hypothesis.

3

(2010) show that for emerging markets more generally, the unbiasedness hypothesis coefficient is
typically more positive3 .
The earliest studies that explored the UIP hypothesis over long horizons include Flood and
Taylor (1997) and Alexius (2001). Flood and Taylor (1997) explores the UIP relationship at three
year horizon pooling 21 currencies of mostly developed countries, with the U.S. Dollar as the base
currency. They estimate β to be 0.596 with a standard error of 0.195. However, the bond yields
used are heterogeneous, with varying maturities, so are difficult to interpret. Alexius (2001) finds
evidence of UIP holding at long horizon using 14 long term bonds of varying maturities, using a
sample from 1957-97. As the sample encompasses the Bretton Woods era and the associated capital
control regime, those findings are perhaps not applicable in current times.
Chinn and Meredith (2004) tested the UIP hypothesis at five year and ten year horizons for the
Group of Seven (G7) countries, and found greater support for the unbiasedness hypothesis holding
at these long horizons than in shorter horizons of three to twelve months. The estimated coefficient
on the interest rate differentials were positive and were closer to the value of unity than to zero in
general. The sample used in that paper extended up to 2000. Figure 1 depicts the indicated pattern
— negative coefficients at short horizons, and positive coefficients at longer horizons, updated to
2007Q4, so as to exclude the effects of the global financial crisis and ensuing period of near zero
interest rates.
[Figure 1 about here.]
In a sample extending up to 2011, Chinn and Quayyum (2013) find that the relationship between
exchange rate changes and interest differentials has altered noticeably both at short and long horizons;
the coefficients of different maturities for major currencies have declined in the wake of the Great
Recession. This point is highlighted in Figure 2.
[Figure 2 about here.]

The model

In this section, we develop a standard small open-economy New Keynesian model following Galı́
(2008) and Walsh (2010).
The world economy constitutes of a continuum of small open economies represented by the unit
interval4 . Since each economy is of measure zero, its performance does not have any impact on the
3
There is an alternative approach that involves using survey-based data to measure exchange rate expectations.
Chinn and Frankel (1994) document that it is difficult to reject UIP for a broad set of currencies when using survey
based forecasts. Similar results are obtained by Chinn (2014), when extending the data up to 2009. These results echo
early findings by Froot and Frankel (1989). While we do not pursue this avenue in this paper (long horizon expectations
being difficult to obtain), it is useful to recall these findings when interpreting rejections of the joint hypothesis of UIP
and rational expectations.
4
In order to simplify the notation, variables without a k-index are used to refer to the small open economy being
modeled. i.e., the Home country. Variables with a k ∈ [0, 1] subscript refer to economy k other than the Home country,
one among the continuum of economies making up the world economy. Finally, variables with an asterisk superscript
* correspond to the world economy as a whole.

Equation (20) takes the form of a familiar consumption Euler equation. Notice that following large

Since our model has a complete asset market (see Section 3.5), this budget constraint is an abbreviated version.
We only use (19) to derive the IS curve. In fact, the household is subject to a complete set of assets against all sorts
of risks.

where Zt ≡ 0 YtY(j)
dj. Galı́ and Monacelli (2005) proved that equilibrium variations in zt ≡ lnZt
t
around the perfect foresight steady state are of second order. Thus, up to a first order approximation,
we have an aggregate relationship
y t = nt + ǫ t
(22)
Each firm faces a constant elasticity demand curve for its output, The firm’s real marginal cost
is equal to
Wt /Pth
M Ct =
e ǫt
where PWht is the real product wage and eǫt is the marginal product of labor. In terms of percentage
t
deviations around the steady state, this expression becomes
mct = wt − pht − ǫt

(23)

We assume that firms set prices in a staggered fashion, as in Calvo (1983). Hence, a measure
1 − ω of (randomly selected) firms sets new prices each period, with an individual firm’s probability
of re-optimizing in any given period being independent of the time elapsed since it last reset its price.

3.3

The Law of One Price, Terms of Trade, and the Real Exchange Rate

For the rest of the world, the distinction between the CPI and the price of domestic production is
ignored, both denoted as Pt∗ . That is, the rest of the world is large relative to the home country7 ,
so changes in the price of home-produced goods have little impact on the consumer price index for
the rest of the world. Because of asymmetry, all imported goods sell for the same price Ptf at home
country. That is, Pk,t (j) = Pk,t = Ptf for any j, k ∈ [0, 1]. Assume that the law of one price holds.
This implies
Ptf = St Pt∗
(24)
The terms of trade is the relative price of imported goods:

inflation in the consumer price index equals
πtc = pct − pct−1

= πth + γ(δt − δt−1 )

(31)

The Rest of the World

Since the home country is of zero measure, variables of the rest of the world is actually equivalent
to the whole world. This means that it is unnecessary to distinguish between domestic output and
consumption for the rest of the world. i.e. Ct∗ = Yt∗ . Similar to (15), it is easy to derive
Cth∗ = γ∆at Yt∗
or

(32)

Complete Asset Markets and International Risk Sharing

We assume complete asset markets in this model. As we mentioned in Section 3.1, the household is
subject to a complete set of assets against all sorts of risks. For any state s of the economy at Period
t+1, there exists a corresponding Arrow security with price vt that pays one unit of Home currency
in period t+1 if and only if state s occurs8 .
Assume state s occurs with probability τ (s). Then for the Home households, intertemporal
substitution yields:
vt U ′ (Ct )
βU ′ (Ct+1 (s))τ (s)
(33)
=
c (s)

If such an Arrow security does not exist, we can always construct an identical portfolio from existing assets. This
is guaranteed by the definition of complete asset markets.

Uncovered Interest Parity

We model the uncovered interest parity equation following McCallum (1994) and Engel (2015), that
the market’s expectation of the currency depreciation differs from the rational expectation by a
mean-zero, i.i.d. random variable ui :
it − i∗t = Et st+1 − st + uit

(44)

The presence of this error term is crucial, and yet at the same time intuitively plausible. Perhaps
agents in the market do not make the effort to calculate the fully rational expectations (such as
in bounded rationality), so that each period they make an error in expectations formation that
has a mean of zero and is completely transitory. Hence, the consequent deviation from rational
expectations is not systematic. Evidence that market expectations are not unbiased comes from a
variety of sources, including Chinn and Frankel (1994) and Chinn (2006), for instance.
Using the definition of real exchange rate, we re-write the interest parity equation

Thus (50) can be re-written as:

where uct ≡ −k(1 + η)ǫt is defined as the cost/productivity shock. A positive uct indicates a decrease
in Home productivity.

Monetary Policy Rule for the Small Open Economy

Assume Home monetary authority adopts a stylized Taylor-type rule, where the domestic interest
rate respond systematically to (expected) domestic inflation, output, and expected real exchange
rate depreciation:

where umt is an exogenous shock to the monetary policy. The second equation follows from (31).

That is, the long-term interest rate is determined as the average of the current short-term interest

There is an important asymmetry in our treatment of the households maximization problem
with respect to the intertemporal dimension versus the cross-country dimension; in the latter we
have appended a disturbance term, while none such exists in the EHTS just described. This implicit
segmentation is consistent with the evidence provided by Alexius and Sellin (2006), showing that
parity between yields on short term instruments fails to hold while parity cannot be rejected on
holding period returns on long term instruments.

Model Calibration

In this section, we calibrate the model and show that the calibrated New Keynesian model captures
the pre-ZLB (1975Q1-1995Q4) volatility of Japanese 3-month T-bill rate and depreciation of nominal
exchange rate (with U.S. dollar as the base currency). We focus on interest rate and depreciation
of nominal exchange rate because this paper is about whether interest rate ZLB would affect the
coefficient of Fama regression10 .

4.1

Empirical Moments

The Japanese data come from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) database. We use
quarterly observations on Japanese 3-month T-bill rate and depreciation of (log) nominal exchange
rate, starting from 1975Q1 to 1995Q4. The motivation for choosing such sample period is that it
starts from the flexible exchange rate regime, and ends before the advent of the ZLB interest rate
regime11 . We also use U.S. 3-month T-bill rate from Federal Reserve Board’s H.15 release as the
world interest rate. The variance and 90% confidence intervals are summarized as follows12 :
[Table 1 about here.]
10

We can also match the moments for other macroeconomic variables, e.g., output by imposing habit persistence
structure. We do not impose such structure because it brings unnecessary complication without helping us understand
the nature of ZLB.
11
Following Chinn and Meredith (2004), Chinn and Quayyum (2013).
12
Both the depreciation rate and the interest rate are expressed at annual rate, i.e., percent per annum.

13

4.2

Theoretical Predictions

We impose the following additional assumptions:
1. There is no structure change during the period under consideration (1975Q1-1995Q4).
2. Without loss of generality, foreign/world economic variables (output, interest rate, etc.) are
assumed to be constant.
3. All shocks are assumed to be either white noise or stationary AR(1) process:
uit = ρi uit−1 + eit
uct = ρc uct−1 + ect
umt = ρm umt−1 + emt
where ρi = 0. That is, the interest parity shock uit is an i.i.d white noise, which is consistent
with our assumption in Section 3.6.
In our open-economy New Keynesian model, one period is defined as one quarter. We calibrate
and summarize the parameter values in Table 213 . The parameter values are standard and mostly
follow Sanchez (2005), and Braun and Körber (2011). For instance, we set Calvo-pricing parameter
ω = 0.89, indicating that Japanese firms reset prices every 9 quarters, which is consistent with
Sanchez (2005)’s estimation that Japan’s ω varies from 0.58 to 0.92.
[Table 2 about here.]
The variances of the exchange rate depreciation and interest differential implied by the theoretical
model are 0.004544 and 0.000688 respectively, which lie within the 90% confidence interval derived
from the actual data (Table 1), and are quite close to the variance estimated from the actual data.

Uncovered Interest Parity far from the ZLB

5.1

Closed-Form Solution

Given the VAR system summarized in Section 3.11 and 4.2, our model has a closed-form solution
that it − i∗t , Et st+1 − st , qt , πth , etc, are linear combinations of the AR(1) shocks uit , uct , and umt .
Without loss of generality, we shall write the solution as:
it − i∗t = c1 uit + c2 uct + c3 umt
Et st+1 − st = −(1 − c1 )uit + c2 uct + c3 umt

(65)
(66)

[Figure 3 about here.]
13

Because of symmetry, θ and ξ do not enter the VAR system in Section 3.11. Hence we do not specify their values
in Table 2. We will discuss ī in Section 6, when the interest rate is near ZLB.

14

[Figure 4 about here.]
[Figure 5 about here.]
To illustrate the model’s properties, Figure 3 - 5 shows impulse responses for one standard
deviation innovations in uit (eit ) for the nominal exchange rate depreciation, and interest rates over
different horizons1415 . Our simulation indicates c1 = 0.216 .
[Figure 6 about here.]
[Figure 7 about here.]
[Figure 8 about here.]
[Figure 9 about here.]
[Figure 10 about here.]
[Figure 11 about here.]
Figure 6 - 11 shows impulse responses for standardized innovations in uct (ect ) and umt (emt )
for the nominal exchange rate depreciation over different horizons, and interest rates with different
maturities. All the impulse response functions are intuitive. A positive cost shock ect indicates a
decrease in Home productivity. Home output decreases and inflation increases - this is the wellknown phenomenon of stagflation. After trade-off between inflation and unemployment, the central
bank will set a higher interest rate to eliminate inflation. This also brings an expected depreciation
of Home currency. A positive monetary shock emt has a similar effect. It implies the central bank
increases interest rate unexpectedly. Obviously it increases interest rate and expected depreciation
instantly. Our simulation indicates c2 = 1.95 and c3 = −0.065517 . The closed-form solution also
provides a convenient way to calculate the theoretical moments18 .

In those graphs, i 2 refers to interest rate with 6-month (2-quarter) maturity. ds 2 refers to depreciation rate over
two quarters. Similar definitions apply for other variables.

Note in our simulation, the depreciation rate and interest rate are quarterly rate, i.e., percent per quarter. Hence,
variances derived from equations (65) and (66) should be multiplied by 16 to compare with the empirical moments in

(67)

According to our calibration, uit (eit ) is more volatile than uct (ect ) and umt (emt ). At short horizon,
uit (eit ) dominates. Hence at short horizon Fama regression generally yields a negative coefficient.
From our derivation (67), it is straightforward to see the endogeneity caused by uit makes this
estimator deviate from unity, and sometimes being negative.

increases as N grows, so we would get a larger Fama regression coefficient estimate at longer horizon.
Hence, we expect to find unbiasedness hypothesis holds better at long horizons than at short in our
simulated data. Strictly, we have the following proposition:
Proposition 1 plimβ̂(N ) is monotonically increasing in N .
Proof. Straightforward.

5.4

Simulation Results

In this sub-section, stochastic simulations were performed on the model. Each simulation was performed over a 100 periods. This process was repeated 1000 times to generate a hypothetical population of 1000 such draws. For each draw, standard UIP regression were run, using horizons varying
from 1 to 40 quarters. The average parameters as well as their confidence intervals are shown in
Figure 12.
[Figure 12 about here.]
The simulated results are consistent with our analysis in Section 5.2 and 5.3, as well as Chinn
and Meredith (2004).

6

Uncovered Interest Parity near the ZLB

When the interest rate is near the ZLB, Taylor rule (61) has to be re-written as
h
it = max{0, δπ Et πt+1
+ δ y yt +

δπ γ
Et ∆qt+1 + umt }
1−γ

(69)

This brings about two important changes to the economy:
(i) The Transmission Mechanism
When the interest rate is positive, uit and uct affect central bank’s monetary policy decisions
h , y and E ∆q
and enter it via Et πt+1
t
t
t+1 , and umt affects it directly. Then the interest rate affects
household intertemporal substitution decisions, and determines demand, which in turn, affects
inflation, output and the exchange rate. However, if the ZLB is binding, such a transmission
mechanism is shut down. When the shocks uit , uct , and umt enter in the determination of it ,
it will remain at zero, and these disturbances are blocked.
(ii) Household Expectations and Intertemporal Substitution

17

When the ZLB is binding, it will remain at zero despite the realization of uit , uct , and umt .
The households are able to anticipate this situation ahead of time, so they will adjust their
intertemporal substitution decisions accordingly20 .
With these changes, a closed-form solution no longer exists, and we cannot derive plimβ̂ as in
Section 5.2 and 5.3. Nonetheless, in our model, both st+1 − st and it − i∗t (as well as it ) are driven
by three shocks uit (eit ), uct (ect ), and umt (emt ), where uit is volatile but transitory, and the other
two disturbances are less volatile but more persistent.
ī — the steady state level of it 21 plays an important role with occasionally binding ZLB. If ī
is large, then ZLB does not bind very often. When it does bind, it is most likely triggered by a
negative uit (eit ), and the possibility of binding ZLB is generally random. This approach is denoted
by “Random ZLB ”. However, if ī is small, then ZLB binds more frequently. When it binds, it is
often triggered by a negative uct (ect ) or umt (emt ), and the interest rate series are segmented. i.e.,
if it = 0, then it is very likely that its adjacent leads and lags are also zero. If it > 0, then it is very
likely that its adjacent leads and lags are also positive. This is determined by the different degree of
persistence and volatility of different shocks. This approach is denoted by “Persistent ZLB ”.
Again, we perform stochastic simulations for our model with ZLB constraint. Our simulation
(with ZLB) method follows Holden and Paetz (2012), as well as Erceg and Lindé (2014). Each
simulation was performed over a 100 periods. This process was repeated 1000 times to generate a
hypothetical population of 1000 such draws. In our simulation, about half the time (49.99%) the
interest hits ZLB. Figure 13 is one such random draw of 100-period simulation, where the interest
ZLB constraint follows “Persistent ZLB ” approach. This indicates our simulation is consistent with
the fact that Japan (starting from 1996) set their short term interest rate (close to) zero for several
consecutive years.
[Figure 13 about here.]
With “Persistent ZLB ”, most binding ZLB periods are triggered by a negative uct (ect ) or umt
(emt ). That is, the shocks uct (ect ) and umt (emt ) are suppressed under ZLB constraints. Recall
in Section 5.2, we showed volatility of uct (ect ) and umt (emt ) are critical to offset the endogeneity
caused by uit (eit ). Once uct (ect ) and umt (emt ) are suppressed by ZLB constraints, the endogeneity
problem deteriorates, hence we would expect the constrained Fama regression coefficient to be less
positive. That is, unbiasedness hypothesis holds worse when interest rate is near ZLB. Such property
is summarized in Figure 14, and it is consistent with Figure 2, and Chinn and Quayyum (2013).
[Figure 14 about here.]
20

A common mistake is to write the solution as it − i∗t = max{0, c1 uit + c2 uct + c3 umt } and Et st+1 − st = it − i∗t − uit .
This is wrong because it does not take into account the fact that the households are able to anticipate ZLB ahead of
time. Actually, a closed-form solution does not exist when the interest rate is near ZLB.
21
The so-defined ī also includes other constants omitted by log-linearization. Hence it does not necessarily equal
1
−
1. For conciseness, it is still referred to as “the steady state level of it ”.

Conclusion

Two empirical findings underpin the exercises conducted in this paper. First, interest differentials
at longer horizons tend to correlate positively with exchange rate depreciation, while those at short
horizons tend to correlate negatively. Second, long horizon interest differentials tend to reject the
unbiasedness hypothesis more strongly for exchange rates that involve a currency that has experienced low interest rates for an extended period. To the extent that low interest rates are likely to
be a part of the global economic landscape for some time, it is of interest to know why this finding
obtains.
Using a standard New Keynesian DSGE, incorporating sticky prices, we show how these empirical
findings can be rationalized. The long horizon/short horizon dichotomy stylized fact is shown using
a random (non-persistent) shock to the UIP relationship, along with persistent aggregate supply and
monetary policy shocks. The attenuation in the long horizon unbiasedness in the era of low interest
rates is replicated by simulating the NK DSGE in the presence of a zero lower bound.
