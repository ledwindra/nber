Relative Wage Variability in the United States, 1860-1983

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the magnitude of changes in relative wages across
industries between 1860 and 1983 and analyzes the macroeconomic determinants of

such changes at different intervals during this period. The variance across
industries in wage growth was at least four times larger before 1948 than

afterward. Except for smaller year-to-year variability in output growth across
industries after 1948, the macroeconomic factors examined cannot account for

this increased rigidity of relative wages. Increases in average establishment
size and improved communication of wage trends are probably partially

responsible for the observed increase in relative wage rigidity. No single
macroeconomic model was consistent with the year-to-year fluctuations in
relative wage rigidity in every historical period examined.

I. INTRODUCTION
This paper examines the magnitude of changes in relative wages across
industries between 1860 and 1983 and analyzes the macroeconomic determinants of
such changes at different intervals during this period. By studying the
magnitude of relative wage changes over such a long period, new light can be
shed on the old question of whether the wage structure has become more rigid in
the post-World War II period (or, using the terminology currently popular,

whether there has been a gradual shift away from spot markets toward long-term
contracts in the labor market- -a subject pursued in more depth in Kniesner and
Goldsmith (1986)).

The macroeconomic determinants of changes in relative wages and prices

have received considerable attention over the last 10 years, but all previous
studies have focused on the post-World War II period and have ignored the

question of whether structural changes have taken place. A key factor in any
period should be the magnitude of sectoral shifts within the

economy.

Hamermesh (1986) has shown how increased dispersion of changes in output across
industries should be positively correlated to changes in relative wages. In
addition he, Fischer (1981), and Cukierman (1984) have pointed out how data on
changes in relative wages and prices can be used to test a variety of models of

aggregate behavior. This paper extends this work by testing these models in
different periods and examining whether structural changes in wage setting
behavior have taken place.

II. DATA
This study examines five different data sources to trace the long-run

changes in relative wage variability between 1860 and 1983. Clarence Long
(1960) compiled series of daily wage rates in January and July for thirteen

2

manufacturing industries and building for 1860 to 1890 from the Aldrich

report. Only the January to January changes are examined below because all
other series available for this period are annual. He also compiled separate
series by state for seven of the manufacturing industries, with two to seven
states per industry.

Paul Douglas' (1930) wage series for "payroll" (nonunion) and "union"
manufacturing, building trades, unskilled labor, farm labor, coal mining,

transportation, federal employees, teachers, and ministers are used for the

1890-1926 period. This sample covers a wider range of industries, allowing for
separate estimates of relative wage rigidity in different sectors such as
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries and union and nonunion
manufacturing industries.

The Conference Board published wage data for twenty-one manufacturing

industries for July between 1920 and 1936. This information is of limited
usefulness for regression analysis because of the small number of

observations. Nonetheless, this data set is an extremely interesting one for
the obvious reason that it documents relative wage changes during most of the
Great Depression.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) did not begin to publish industry data
in detail sufficient to gauge changes in relative wages until 1947. Although
Hamermesh has examined this period with considerable care, some new results are
reported below for 20 two-digit manufacturing industries for 1947-1983 to

facilitate comparisons with the earlier periods. The data come from CITIBASE.
The final data set examined here is the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) series of wages and salaries per full-time equivalent employee.

3

Although not a wage series, it is examined here because it covers the period
between the end of the Conference Board series and the beginning of the BLS

series. Data for 55 two-digit industries in all sectors are used for
1929-1948; 57 industries, for 1949-1982.

III. COMPARISONS ACROSS PERIODS
Changes in relative wages are defined here in terms of the variance in the

rate of change of wages across industries. A percentage change in the wage in
industry i in period t (dwit), which is greater (less) than the percentage

change in the mean wage across all industries in period t (dw), is defined as

a relative wage increase (decrease). The variance of dwt (VWt) is used to
measure the overall magnitude of relative wage changes, where

VW E iI (dw.
i Et

—

dw)2

and Et equals employment in industry i in period t and Et

The mean value of W for each of the samples containing wage data are
reported in Figure 1. They show that, on average, relative wages are much more
rigid in the post-war period than in earlier periods. Between 1860 and 1890
relative wages changed 10 times as much each year as they did after 1947.
Annual relative wage changes were 16 times greater between 1890 and 1926 and 12
times greater between 1920 and 1936 than they were after 1947.

These results are reported in further detail in Table 1. In the 1860-1890
period, the changes in relative wages become even greater once interstate

variation within a subset of industries is taken into account. The mean change

4

in relative wages across states and industries in line 3 is 25 percent larger
than the mean change reported over a larger set of industries in line 2.

Differences in the magnitude of relative wage changes across sectors in the

1890-1926 period are reported in lines 4 through 7. Relative wages in
manufacturing changed by roughly the same extent as they did in the

nonmanufacturing sector, as can be seen by comparing lines 4 and 5. Relative
wages changed much more within the nonunion sector of manufacturing than in the

union sector, well before the advent of the three-year agreement. The changes
in relative wages between 1920 and 1936 in line 8 are comparable to those
between 1860 and 1926.
The smaller changes in relative wages in the post-war period are documented

in more detail in lines 9 and 10. Weighting clearly has little effect on the
overall trend in relative wages. One possible source (in a statistical sense)
of the greater rigidity of relative wages in this period can be seen by
comparing the minimum and maximum changes in relative wages in the postwar
period to those of earlier periods. Between 1890 and 1936, the maximum changes
in relative wages (which occur in periods when there are severe shocks to the

economy) are 20 to over 100 times greater than the minimum changes. Since
1947, the maximum changes are only about 10 times larger than the minimum

changes. This shows that the swings in relative wage change behavior have
become much less extreme. This may be attributable to smaller shocks (in terms
of amplitude or duration), stabilization policies, or changes in wage-setting
mechanisms.

Even though relative wages changed much less since 1947, the average
year-to-year change in the average wage tended to be greater in the most recent

period. Wages rose by 5.6 percent per year between 1947 and 1983, whereas the

5

absolute value of the annual rate of change of manufacturing wages in earlier

periods ranged between 3.4 and 4.3 percent between 1890 and 1936. Despite the
greater mean rate of change, there was much less fluctuation around the mean

after 1947. The standard deviation of the rate of change of wages is .022 for
1947-1983, whereas it ranges between .048 and .098 in the earlier periods.

This suggests that there actually may have been less uncertainty since 1947
about changes in average wages, which may be partially responsible for the
smaller changes in relative wages.

The heterogeneity of these data sets raises the question of whether relative
wages really have become more rigid, with the alternative hypothesis being that

there is less noise in the BLS data. One reason to doubt the latter is that
the Conference Board data were collected with methods quite comparable to those

used by BLS. A more convincing reason to discount this argument comes from the
NIPA data. The longer span of this data set provides the opportunity to
examine whether there was a noticeable downward shift in relative full-time

income variability after 1936. This would be consistent with a decline in
relative wage variability (unless year-to-year variability in full-time hours

declined over this period, a highly unlikely condition). Such a shift seems to
have taken place around 1948, as shown in lines 12 and 13. Mean relative
full-time income variability before 1948 was nine times greater than after
1948.

Another problem in interpreting the means in Table 1 is differences in the

level of aggregation across the four data sets. For instance, Long reports
separate series for two different types of metals and two different types of

textile products. In the two-digit SIC code used for manufacturing by BLS,
there is but one series for each of these major sectors. Similar problems

6

arise in Douglas' series and, to a lesser extent, in the Conference Board

series. This aggregation reduces the total variation in the rate of change in
wages. To examine how much of the lower variation in the post-war period is
attributable to aggregation, the post-war series are re-examined at the three-

digit level. The results in line 14 show a slight increase in relative wage
variability results when more disaggregated data are used, but the basic
finding of lower relative wage variability in the post-war period is
unaffected.

A further difficulty is measurement error in the Douglas data. Douglas had
to impute values for seven of the nonunion manufacturing industries for every

other year after 1914. To the extent Douglas' imputations were erroneous, the
variance in the rate of change of wages in his series is overstated during this

period. The magnitude of this bias cannot be ascertained readily through
pre-and post-1914 comparisons because the variability of changes in output

across sectors is greatest after 1914. One reason to doubt that this bias is
very large is that the ratio of relative wage variability in nonunion
industries to that of union industries actually fell after 1914.

A final problem in making comparisons across the four data sets is

differences in which sectors are included. For instance, Long includes
brewing, agricultural implements, and carriages and wagons but excludes baking

and knit goods. Douglas does the opposite. A related difficulty is that the
Conference Board and BLS series cover a larger proportion of the manufacturing

sector than the Long and Douglas series. The differences in coverage need not
bias the estimates, but they make comparisons across periods potentially
misleading.

7

To standardize for industry mix, a relative wage variability measure was

constructed for four industries from each data set: textile products,
printing, lumber, and primary metal products. Wage data for textiles,
printing, and primary metals in the Douglas and Conference Board samples were
obtained by aggregating wage series within each category (e.g., knits, woolens,

and cotton were used to create the textiles series in the Douglas data). The
following results were obtained for annual changes in relative wages (x 100):

Standardizing for industrial mix substantially lowers the estimates of relative
wage variability in the prewar period and slightly raises the estimate for the

post-war period. Nonetheless, relative wage variability remains four to seven
times larger in the prewar period.

IV. PATTERNS WITHIN PERIODS
Before turning to a more formal analysis of the determinants of changes in
relative wages, it will be useful to look carefully at the patterns of relative
wage changes within each of the samples under consideration (Figures 2 through
8). In Long's sample for 1860-1890 (see Figure 2), changes in relative wages

were most pronounced during the Civil War. After the war the variance in the

8

rate of change of wages was considerably smaller. The relatively large change
in 1878 took place during a contraction in the business cycle, whereas those in

1871 and 1880 took place in the initial stages of expansions. However,
relative wages changed very little during the contraction of 1870.
The pattern of relative wage changes in Douglas' series between 1890 and
1926 in Figure 3 shows that relative wages changed very little, on average,

between 1890 and 1915. The large changes shown for 1916 to 1918 probably are
attributable to wartime conditions. The biggest changes took place in 1920 and
1921, a period that coincides with a sizable contraction in output.

The Douglas and Conference Board (see Figure 4) series overlap between 1920

and 1926. In this period they show the same pattern--large changes in relative
wages during the contraction of 1923-1924 followed by smaller changes through

1926. The trend toward greater wage rigidity continued until the beginning of
the depression, which first becomes manifest in relative wage changes in 1930.
As the contraction continued, relative wages changed at an accelerating rate.
Even after 1934, the changes in relative wages were greater than just before
the depression.

Annual changes in relative wages since 1947 are reported in Figure 5. The
largest changes took place in the late 1940s and l950s. In the first half of
the 1960s, relative wages hardly changed at all. Over the last twenty years
the largest changes in relative wages took place in 1967, 1971-1972, 1975, and

1983. These periods coincide with either contractions or changes in the
aggregate growth rate. The double-digit inflation rates observed in 1973-1974
and 1979 are associated with relatively small changes in relative wages.

The year-to-year fluctuations in the NIPA relative full-time income series
are reported in Figure 6 for 1929-1982, with values for 1929-1948 and 1948-1982

9

reported in Figures 7 and 8. Figure 6 shows the dramatic drop in relative wage
variability in the last half of the 1940s. The patterns in the NIPA series
during the depression and in the post-war period are similar to those observed

in the Conference Board and NIPA data. Relative wage variability increased
considerably at the beginning of World War II and again at the end of the war.

V. DETERMINANTS OF CHANGES IN RELATIVE WAGES
Hamermesh (1986) shows the implications of two different models of wage

adjustment for changes in relative wages. In Keynesian models, wages are
assumed to be either downwardly rigid in nominal terms (i.e., nominal wages
don't fall, real wages can fall) or downwardly rigid with respect to the

expected rate of price inflation (i.e., nominal and real wages don't fall). In
the former case, inflation allows firms to cut real wages without cutting

nominal wages. In periods of low inflation, a relatively small proportion of
workers receive wage increases and there is relatively little variation in the

rate of increase among those receiving increases. As the inflation rate rises,
more workers receive wage increases and the range of observed increases becomes

larger. In essence, higher inflation allows employers to avoid the constraint
nominal wage rigidity imposes on real wage cuts. In this model there should be
a positive correlation between inflation (both anticipated and unanticipated)

and changes in relative wages. If the minimum rate of wage increase is the
expected rate of inflation instead of zero, expected inflation has no effect on

changes in relative wages. In this case, only unanticipated inflation leads to
larger changes in relative wages.

Hamermesh also shows that the variance across sectors in the rate of growth
of nominal output (VQt) should be positively related to changes in relative

10

wages. The intuition behind this result is fairly clear. When there is
greater variation in the rate of excess demand across sectors, there should be

more variation in labor demand. Unless workers anticipate these shifts and
move accordingly across sectors, this results in changes in relative wages.
Hamermesh tested these propositions for the U.S. after World War II and
found that the data contradict the "Keynesian" propositions --

the variance of

the rate of growth of wages decreases with inflation, especially with

unanticipated inflation (pU). One possible explanation, Hamermesh argues, is
that workers demand more indexing (formal and informal) when there is

uncertainty about inflation. If wage-setting mechanisms throughout the economy
adjust so that more weight is placed on preserving real wages through partial
or complete indexing and less weight is placed on reacting to excess demand for
labor, then one would expect a smaller variance in the growth rate of wages

simply because the CPI is the same for everybody. This rationale can be
further tested by determining whether unexpected inflation reduces VW in other
periods.

If one admits the possibility of heterogeneity of indexing schemes across

can actually increase with pU To see this, rewrite

Hamermesh's empirical model did not contain a measure of uncertainty about

inflation. Conceptually, uncertainty about inflation can be interpreted as

variation of e across individuals. The measure which will be used below is
the variance in the rate of change of the CPI over the previous 10 years,
denoted PIIJNCt below.

Fischer's analysis of the linkages between relative price variability and
inflation points out two other possible rationales for empirical relationships

between inflation and changes in relative wages. The market clearing with
imperfect information approach, developed by Barro (1976) and tested by
Hercowitz (1981, 1982), examines the effect of changes in the money supply on
relative prices in an "islands" model where agents do not know whether observed
price changes are due to inflation or to shifts in relative excess demand.
If supply and demand elasticities vary across markets, misperceptions about
changes in the money supply are translated into actual relative wage changes.
This argument applies equally to unanticipated inflation and deflation- - the

absolute value of the unexpected change in the price level matters, not the

direction of the change. Anticipated inflation and deflation have no effect on
relative wages in this model.
The adjustment cost approach emphasizes the lump-suni costs of changing

wages, and prices. Under both inflation and deflation, these costs
(e.g., paperwork involved with changing wage rates, costs of reporting worker

performance) call for making changes in wages at discrete intervals. As long
as all firms don't make these changes at the same time, this results in changes

in relative wages. Both expected and unexpected changes in the price level
cause changes in relative wages in this model.

expected and unexpected inflation on relative wage variability are summarized

where et and 4 are normally distributed error terms and

and

e

are

parameters to be estimated. Models I and II are estimated with (1); models III
and IV with (2). Model II is distinguished from model I by the restriction

13

i=0; model III from model IV,

by

the restriction 131=0. These restrictions are

tested below with likelihood ratio tests and information criteria. The
equations are estimated by maximum likelihood to allow for first-order serial

correlation without dropping the first year in each sample. The logarithmic
form of the equation was chosen to make the results directly comparable to
Hamermesh' s.

Definitions, means, and standard deviations for each of the variables used

in the regression analysis are reported in Table 2. Expected inflation rates
were generated from rolling AR(3) models estimated over the previous thirty

years. This specification was chosen because of its relatively stable lag
structure and its ability to track changes in the price level throughout each
sample period.

A different data set had to be used in each sample period to construct VQt.
For 1860-1890 I use the five output series in Frickey (1947) which extend

throughout the period: food and kindred products, textile fabrics and
materials, articles from textile fabrics, iron and steel and their products,

and metals and metal products other than iron and steel. For 1890-1926 I use
Shaw's estimates of the implicit price index and the value of output for five

major sectors: perishable goods, semidurable goods, consumer durables,
producer durables, and construction materials. For 1920-1936 1 use the seven
Federal Reserve Board industry indexes which are available for the entire
period (food, tobacco, textiles, lumber, leather, iron and steel, and stone,

clay and glass). For 1929-1982 and 1947-1983 the national income accounts
provide much more comprehensive coverage than any of these other sources. The
variance in the rate of change of output is calculated over one-digit

industries. The variances for 1890-1926, 1929-1982, and 1947-1983 are Divisia

14

weighted by the share of real output in each industry; the variances for the
other two periods are unweighted because dollar values are not reported.
The across-industry variance of the rate of change of output is a function
of a number of factors, including the dispersion of industry-specific excess

demand shocks and the magnitude of economy-wide shocks. The impact of
economy-wide shocks on wages will vary by industry unless demand and supply

elasticities are the same everywhere. To the extent that wage shocks have an
immediate impact on excess demand in product markets, it is plausible that VQt

is a function of W. Ideally, one would like to purge VQt of this influence.
Instrumental variables are available for economy-wide shocks, but not for

industry-specific shocks. Without a good set of instruments, it makes little
sense to replace VQt with predicted VQt. Another alternative is to drop VQt
altogether, but this creates omitted variable bias. In my judgment it is
preferable to include VQt because the magnitude of the within-year impact of
on VQt is likely to be quite small even if the same industry definitions

are used for each variable. Because the industries used to construct VQt never
coincide with those used to construct VWt, there is even less reason to believe

simultaneity bias is a severe problem. The estimates of (1) and (2) are
reported in Tables 3 and 4.

VII. RESULTS
The Keynesian model with nominal wage rigidity implies

> 0, whereas x1=O

in the Keynesian model with real wage rigidity and Hamerniesh's indexing

rationale. Likelihood-ratio tests of the restriction cx1=0 are distributed x2

.29

The restriction is rejected at the 95 percent confidence level for the
1860-1890 and the 1890-1926 samples, but cannot be rejected for the other three

samples. Judge

(1980) and Chow (1983) note that the choice of any

significance level is arbitrary and can be avoided by using information

criteria. The values of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the
Schwartz-Bayes information criterion (SBC) in Tables 3 and 4 are multiplied by
-2, so the relevant test is to see which specification gives the smallest value

in the tables. The information criteria point to essentially the same
conclusion as the likelihood-ratio tests in this case. The c10 restriction is
rejected for 1947-1983 and 1929-1982, but cannot be rejected for 1860-1890 and

1890-1926. The information criteria deliver a split verdict for 1920-1936.
These results show that both anticipated and unanticipated inflation are
positively correlated with changes in relative wages between 1860 and 1926.
This relationship vanishes in the two later samples, where I obtain the same

results as Hamermesh: a negative correlation between unanticipated inflation
and changes in relative wages (albeit at only a 20 percent confidence level).
The notion that inflation lubricates the labor market to permit larger changes

in relative wages seems to hold through 1936, but not afterward. The evidence
is consistent with the indexing rationale in the 1929-1982 and 1947-1983

samples. The difference in the results before and after 1936 is most likely a
response to the sustained inflation of the 1960's and 1970's.
The market clearing with imperfect information model implies f3l==0, whereas

the adjustment cost model requires 8l>0. Likelihood-ratio tests of the
restriction P1=0 are:

16
1860-1890
1890-1926
1920-1936

3.01
5.96
2.98

1929-1982

.05

The restriction can be rejected only for the 1890-1926 sample at conventional
levels of significance. Both information criteria indicate that fii=0 can be

rejected for 1890-1926 and 1920-1936. It is also rejected for 1860-1890 under
the AIC but not the SBC. However, /3j

is

negative in this period, which is not

consistent with the adjustment cost model. The restriction cannot be rejected
for the 1947-1983 and 1929-1982 samples under either AIC or SBC. In summary,
the adjustment cost model is consistent with the evidence for the 1890-1926 and
1920-1936 samples, but otherwise it has little explanatory power.
The evidence for the market clearing with imperfect information model is

fairly weak. Although the estimated values of 2 are positive in every period
except 1947-1983, the hypothesis that 20 can be rejected only for 1860-1890.
It is probably no coincidence that this is the sample period where the
assumption of no current information about prices in other markets is most
likely to hold.

In summary, the evidence is consistent with the Keynesian model with nominal
wage rigidity for 1860 through 1936, the adjustment cost model for 1890 through

1936, and the market clearing model for 1860 through 1890. The Keynesian model
model does not fare as well as its competitors in terms of goodness of fit

criteria (root MSE, R2 and log likelihood values). One way to test these
models against each other within each of these three sample periods is to
estimate a composite equation containing all explanatory variables and then
test whether

or

The former set of restrictions can be

rejected for 1920-1936; the latter set can be rejected for all three periods.

17

The obvious problem with such "tests" is that the composite model makes little

theoretical sense. Nonetheless, the data seem to be saying that more
explanatory power is lost by dropping the absolute values of e and Pu from the

equation than is lost by dropping e and pU• This evidence, along with the
goodness of fit statistics, is more favorable toward the market clearing and
adjustment costs models than the Keynesian models.

Except for the indexing rationale, none of the models examined here are
entirely consistent with the evidence for the 1929-1982 and 1947-1983 samples.
In these samples VQt and PIUNCt are the only variables which are strongly

correlated with relative wage variability. These variables are also generally
positively correlated with VWt in the other three samples. Although the

negative correlation between pU and W reported here is fairly weak, these
results cannot be viewed in isolation from Hamermesh's findings which are based

on a wide variety of measures of pu

1890-1926 and the 1947-1983 samples. The 1890-1926 sample is used in the
comparison because the wage data seem more reliable than those for 1860-1890
and the sample period is considerably longer than that in the Conference Board

data. The results of this decomposition are reported in Table 5.

18

There is only one economically meaningful factor in the decomposition based
on (1) that can account for any of the decline in relative wage variability

between 1890-1926 and 1947-1983: a reduction in the variability of output

growth. By itself this accounts for 22 percent of the decline. Changes in all
other independent variables either had little effect on the decline in relative
wage variability (less unexpected inflation and less variability of past
inflation in 1947-1983) or worked to increase relative wage variability

(higher expected inflation in 1947-1983). Changes in the coefficients and
interactions between changes in the independent variables and changes in the
coefficients exactly offset the impact of reduced variability of output

growth. Statistically speaking, the change in relative wage variability can be
"explainedt' fully by the change in the intercept between the two samples.

The conclusions from the decomposition based on (2) seeni different at first

glance. In this specification, the change in each of the coefficients has a
large impact on the decline in relative wage variability. The biggest
contributor is the growth in the PIUNC coefficient between 1890-1926 and
1947-1983; by itself this accounts for 75 percent of the observed decline in

relative wage variability. The growth in the VQ coefficient and the shrinkage
of the inflation coefficients each account for an additional eleven to fifteen

percent. Yet there is little intuition behind these results; all they say is
that for given values of each independent variable, VQ is smaller in 1947-1983

than in 1890-1926. In fact, these results are more mystifying than those based
on (1) because changes in the means of the independent variables account for a
negligible proportion of the change in the dependent variable.
What other factors can account for the increasing rigidity of relative

wages? Based on the discussion in Section III, it is clear that some of the

19

decline in W can be attributed to more accurate measurement of wages and
changes in the industrial mix. Yet it is equally clear from that discussion
that factors such as measurement error, aggregation, and industrial mix are not
the entire story.

Two possible historical factors behind the drop in W over time are the
growth of unions and the increase in the average size of establishments. The
impact of these changes in economic structure on relative wage variability is
examined in Allen (1987) by regressing the wage growth rate in each industry on

the average wage growth rate, a labormarket counterpart to the beta used in

stock market analysis. This measure is called w-beta. The mean value of W
over any period is directly related to the dispersion of w-betas around one.
In Douglas's "union" manufacturing industries, w-beta tends to be less than or
equal to one; in other manufacturing industries, it is generally greater than

one. For unions to reduce VW, the w-beta estimates for industries which are
unionized or become unionized must converge toward one without any similar

adjustment in nonunion industries. No such pattern is evident in the data;
the estimates of w-beta converge toward one in practically every industry. The
hypothesis that w-beta equals one can be rejected in only two cases in the BLS

data. Thus, union growth does not seem to be a key factor.
The impact of the growth of average establishment size can be evaluated in

an analogous fashion. In the Long data, the mean value of w-beta for
industries with average establishment size of 50 or smaller is .736; whereas it

is 1.146 in all other industries. In the Conference Board data, the mean value
of w-beta is .694 in industries where average establishment size is 100 or

below. In industries with 101 to 500 employees, the mean value of w-beta is
.969; 501 or more, 1.084. A reduction in the employment share of smaller

20

establishments would reduce the variation of w-beta around one, but because of
the extreme difficulties in comparing average establishment size across these
different data sets it is by no means certain that this has occurred.

A final possible explanation of the drop in t is improved communication of
wage information. Today BLS does monthly surveys of large samples of
establishments to gauge wage trends. This information is released with a
relatively short lag and is widely disseminated. In contrast wage studies done
in earlier periods were usually limited to particular industries or geographic
areas and were not released in enough time to be of more than academic

interest. Better information should reduce the odds that wages will be set at
levels where markets do not clear.

IX. CONCLUSION
This paper has documented a large decline since World War II in the

magnitude of changes in relative wages across industries. The reasons for this
increase in wage rigidity are not yet clear. Except for greater variability in
output, the macroeconomic factors examined here do not seem to have had much

effect on the rise in relative wage rigidity. Increases in average
establishment size and improved communication of wage trends are probably
partially responsible for the observed drop in relative wage variability.
Across all periods examined, no single macroeconomic model explained

year-to-year fluctuations in the rate at which relative wages change. Rational
expectations models are consistent with the evidence for 1860-1890 and the
adjustment cost model is consistent with the results for 1890-1926 and

1920-1936. The Keynesian model with nominal wage rigidity is also consistent
with the results for these three samples, but it has less explanatory power.

21

In the post-war samples, the results are consistent only with the indexing
rationale developed by Hamermesh.
