Commodity Booms and Busts in Emerging Economies

ABSTRACT
Emerging economies, particularly those dependent on commodity exports, are prone to highly
disruptive economic cycles. This paper proposes a small open economy model for a net
commodity exporter to quantitatively study the triggers of these cycles. The economy consists of
two sectors, one of which produces commodities with prices subject to exogenous international
fluctuations. These fluctuations affect both the competitiveness of the economy and its borrowing
terms, as higher commodity prices are associated with lower spreads between the country's
borrowing rate and world interest rates. Both effects jointly result in strongly positive effects of
commodity price increases on GDP, consumption and investment, and a negative effect on the
total trade balance. Furthermore, they generate excess volatility of consumption over output and a
large volatility of investment. The model structure nests various candidate sources of shocks
proposed in previous work on emerging economy business cycles. Estimating the model on
Argentine data, we find that the contribution of commodity price shocks to fluctuations in
post-1950 output growth is in the order of 38%. In addition, commodity prices account for around
42% and 61% of the variation in consumption and investment growth, respectively. We find
transitory productivity shocks to be an important driver of output fluctuations, exceeding the
contribution of shocks to the trend, which is smaller, although not negligible.

Introduction
Emerging economies, particularly those that are dependent on commodity exports, have

a long history of volatile and disruptive economic cycles. A rich literature in International
Macroeconomics has proposed several explanations for these cycles, pointing to different
plausible triggers or underlying sources of shocks. The relative importance of the various
triggers, however, still divides the literature. Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) argue that the main
source of fluctuations is nonstationary productivity shocks - the cycle is the trend. Garcı́aCicco et al. (2010) refute the argument, showing that these shocks only explain a negligible
fraction of fluctuations. They contend that the main drivers of shocks are stationary TFP
shocks and exogenous shocks to the interest rate premium. The latter result is in line with
work by Guimaraes (2011) and Neumeyer and Perri (2005). The role of commodity prices
and, more generally, terms of trade, however, has remained elusive in this debate.1 Recent
empirical work by Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2017) has raised questions on the ability of
terms of trade to account for critical features of business cycles in emerging economies, while
estimates by Fernández et al. (2017) suggest that fluctuations in commodity prices could
account for a significant share of output fluctuations.2 For economies with a comparative
advantage in the production of commodities, the terms of trade and (real) commodity prices
tend to display a highly positive correlation, and hence the tension between these two studies’
results invites a fresh take. In turn, these results call for a tighter connection with earlier
studies on the relative importance of different productivity and interest rate shocks.
This paper seeks to quantitatively assess the drivers of cycles using a unified model that
nests the various sources of shocks advanced in the literature. The model builds on the
1
Some exceptions that focus on the terms of trade include Mendoza (1995) and Kose (2002), who conclude
that terms of trade explain a large fraction of the output variance.
2
Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2017) empirically estimate the impulse response function of GDP and
consumption to terms of trade shocks. They find that consumption responds negatively to terms of trade
innovations, in sharp contrast to the positive response of GDP. Given the overall positive comovement between
consumption and GDP in the data, their work bode negative prospects for terms of trade as main drivers of the
cycle. Empirical results in Fernández et al. (2017) however, suggest that commodity prices could potentially
account for a significant fraction of output fluctuations, though their paper does not provide impulse response
functions for the various macroeconomic aggregates to shed light on the mechanisms or the comovements
across variables. Another empirical paper with a focus on commodity prices, and the resulting procyclicality
of fiscal policy, is Cespedes and Velasco (2014).

small open economy setting of Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) and Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010) by
adding two elements absent from their analysis. First, it allows for a second sector to capture
the separate role of commodities in the economy. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the case
of a net commodity exporting country facing exogenous international price changes. Second,
the model embeds a negative relation between the interest rate premium and commodity
prices, which we show is consistent with the empirical evidence. To study the predictions of
our model, we resort both to a calibration exercise and to the estimation of the model with
Bayesian methods.
The quantitative analysis throughout the paper focuses on Argentina, a quintessential
example of commodity exporting emerging economy.

To set the stage, we begin by

documenting a number of empirical regularities. In common with other emerging economies,
Argentina displays large and persistent cyclical fluctuations, excess volatility of consumption
over output, high volatility of investment, and a negative correlation between output growth
and the trade balance. In addition, the Argentine data reveal large positive effects of world
commodity price shocks on output, consumption and investment, as well as negative effects
on the trade balance. We identify these shocks using a structural vector autoregression
(SVAR) model with a standard Cholesky decomposition, relying on the assumption that
world commodity prices are not contemporaneously affected by Argentina’s economic activity.
Furthermore, the data display a strong negative association between interest rate spreads
in Argentina and world commodity prices. Maintaining the assumption that international
commodity prices are exogenous to developments in Argentina’s economy, we estimate this
relation with a set of regressions of measures of Argentine real rates (net of world interest
rates) on the international commodity price index and various controls. The strongly negative
relation is robust across a number of specifications, with different spread measures and
different sets of controls, including output growth, the trade balance and the debt-to-GDP
ratio. The lower bound of our estimates suggests that a 10 percent deviation of commodity
prices from their long-run mean can move Argentina’s real interest spread by almost 2
percentage points. This finding also confirms some of the existing evidence from the literature

3

on interest rate spreads of commodity exporting economies (see for example Fernández et al.,
2015, Bastourre et al., 2012, and Shousha, 2016). It also connects with earlier work by
Kaminsky et al. (2005) on the procyclicality of capital flows in developing countries.3
In the model calibration exercise we analyze the response of the economy to commodity
price shocks of a sensibly calibrated size, which we can directly compare to the impulse
response functions obtained from the SVAR. We find that the model impulse response
functions and theoretical moments of the model line up well with the empirical evidence.
The two effects stemming from commodity prices (that is, the competitiveness effect and
the borrowing cost effect) jointly produce impulse response functions to a commodity price
shock that mimic the empirical responses not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. They
generate a strongly positive effects on GDP, consumption and investment, and a negative
effect on the total trade balance. They also give rise to excess volatility of consumption over
output and a large volatility of investment. The first effect alone (akin to a productivity
increase) cannot generate a countercyclical trade balance. The second effect alone (which
is isomorphic to a simple negative interest rate shock) does not give a contemporaneous
response in output, while consumption and investment do increase on impact.
The aim of the structural estimation of the model is to gauge the quantitative importance
of commodity price shocks, relative to other shocks, in driving the business cycle. We apply
Bayesian estimation methods, using data on output, consumption, investment and the trade
balance of Argentina. We estimate the stochastic processes of various exogenous disturbances,
as well as the parameter governing the sensitivity of the interest rate spreads to commodity
prices and the parameter capturing the debt elasticity of the economy’s interest rate. Our
results suggest a sizable contribution of commodity price shocks to Argentine business cycle
fluctuations. The posterior forecast error variance decomposition based on data from 1900 to
2015 attributes 22% of the observed variation in output growth to commodity price shocks.
Furthermore, 24% of consumption growth and 34% of investment growth can be explained
by commodity price shocks according to our estimation. Reassuringly, the model-implied

process for the commodity price shares important features with empirically observed world
commodity prices. Since it resembles the data well after 1950, we also repeat the estimation
on the post-1950 subsample and find that the contribution of commodity shocks to output,
consumption and investment growth rises to around 38%, 42% and 61% respectively.
Our assessment of the remaining variation in macroeconomic aggregates sheds additional
light on the debate around candidate drivers of emerging economy business cycles previously
proposed in the literature. We find that in general, stationary technology shocks remain
the most important source of fluctuations, explaining around half of the variation in output
growth, and are quantitatively more important than non-stationary technology shocks. While
this echoes the conclusion of Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010) who question the notion that the
“cycle is the trend” in emerging economies, the contribution of nonstationary shocks remains
non-negligible, as these shocks are able to explain 21% of the variation in output growth in
the two samples used in the estimation.4 We also find a significant role for preference shocks
and interest rate shocks, in particular for explaining important shares of the variation in
consumption, investment and the trade balance.
Taken together, our results suggest that commodity prices should feature prominently in
the analysis of business cycles in emerging economies. In terms of quantitative contribution,
they are among the three most important shocks driving output growth in Argentina.
Importantly, shocks to international commodity prices, in contrast to inherently unobservable
concepts such as domestic TFP shocks, are factors that are easier to detect and measure, and
eventually act upon, by policy makers.5
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a number of empirical
regularities characterizing Argentine business cycles. As said, many of these regularities are
shared with other emerging commodity exporting countries, though for the sake of accuracy
4

Our conclusion with respect to this aspect is quite similar to recent findings of Akinci (2017).
Our model does not feature sovereign default or distress. While sovereign default episodes have been
important for Argentina, we think there is a lot of merit in understanding the triggers of the cycles and how
they are affected by external factors such as commodity prices in a relatively simple setting, which more
realistically would end with a technical default. A better understanding of these regularities may actually
help in avoiding default episodes by guiding policy. As will become clear, the model features a negative
externality, as households do not take into account the effect of their borrowing on interest rates, which can
lead to overborrowing.

Emerging Market Cycles: Empirical Regularities

2.1

Data and Sample

We start this section by presenting the main empirical features that characterize the
business cycle of Argentina’s economy from 1900 to 2015.

Though there are strong

commonalities across emerging countries, we think it is important to work with a straight
mapping from a single country to the model, rather than using averages across different
countries, which might confound effects due to aggregation. The focus on a long time period is
both insightful and befitting for a number of reasons. First, Argentina’s large and persistent
economic cycles call for a lengthy time span in order to capture a reasonable number of
completed cycles in the analysis. Second, unlike advanced economies, Argentina’s cyclical
properties have shown virtually no changes over this long period. This is apparent in Figure
1, Panel (a), which plots the logarithm of Argentine real GDP per capita from 1900 to 2015.
Argentina’s output volatility in the first half of the 20th century (measured as the standard
deviation of real GDP growth rates) is practically the same as the volatility in the post
1950 period, despite the higher levels of development in the latter part of the sample. In the
corresponding plot for the United States, shown in Panel (b), marked changes in the volatility
of output are visible. This typically leads researchers to separately analyze data before and
after the World War II, or before and after the 1980s, which was when the Great Moderation
occurred in the United States. Such changes in volatility are not present in Argentina, which
makes a case for analyzing fluctuations jointly over the entire period.6 Third, Argentina’s
6
A similar argument is made by Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010), who emphasize the importance of a long horizon
to disentangle transitory shocks from shocks to trend growth in business cycles of emerging economies, which
are the focus of Aguiar and Gopinath (2007). We will also aim at disentangling these two types of shocks in
our model estimation, in addition to our focus on commodity prices.

trend growth rate has been remarkably stable since 1900, at 1.2 percent per year, a constancy
that can be fully appreciated by taking a long-term perspective in analyzing its business
cycles.7 In addition to output data, we will focus on typical macroeconomic variables of
interest in small open economies, by studying the fluctuations of consumption, investment,
and the trade balance. The data come from a variety of sources, including most notably
Ferreres (2005).8

Furthermore, since our aim is to assess the role of commodity price fluctuations for
Argentina’s economy, we need to select an appropriate commodity price index.

Our

preferred index is the one constructed by Grilli and Yang (1988), which we update following
Pfaffenzeller et al. (2007). The index is available from 1900 and reflects world commodity
prices, which is advantageous because developments in global prices are arguably exogenous to
economic conditions in Argentina (see further discussion below). The drawback, of course, is
that it may capture price developments of commodities that are unimportant, or even absent,
in Argentina’s commodity export composition.9 We therefore cross-check this index with an
7
This is also different in the US, where low frequency changes in the trend growth rate are present (see
Antolin-Diaz et al., 2017, for comprehensive evidence). We therefore fit a cubic rather than linear trend in
Panel (b) of Figure 1.

We extend the series to 2015. Compared to Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010), we add another half decade of
data. Details on the sources and construction of the data are provided in Appendix A.

Argentina exports mainly agricultural and food commodities such as meat, maize and soy beans, but to
a lesser extent also petroleum, gold and other non-food commodities.

Argentina-specific commodity price index, which we construct using commodity price data
provided by the World Bank, together with trade weights available from the UN Comtrade
data base. This construction is possible from 1962 onwards. Figure 2, Panel (a) plots the two
indices (in nominal terms) and shows that their year-on-year changes are fairly synchronized,
mitigating the concern that the world price index may not be representative of commodity
prices faced by Argentina. We deflate the Grilli and Yang (1988) index to be a relative
(“real”) price using an index of (US-dollar denominated) import prices for Argentina.10
Figure 2, Panel (b) plots this time series in deviations from its sample mean. We focus
on mean deviations rather than other detrending methods, since we are interested to also
capture persistent movements over longer time spans, sometimes referred to as “supercycles”
in commodity prices.

Notes: Panel (a) compares the index of Grilli and Yang (1988) with an Argentina specific commodity prices
index constructed based on UN CommTrade and World Bank data. These series are in nominal terms and
normalized to the same value in 1962. Panel (b) displays the commodity price index of Grilli and Yang (1988),
deflated with the Argentine import price index (in US dollars), and in log-deviations from sample mean.

We begin our characterization of the empirical regularities by documenting business cycle
10

The import price index updates the series published by Ferreres (2005). We have tried alternative ways
of deflating the commodity price series, for example using manufacturing prices (also expressed in US dollars),
or the US consumer price index. The changes did not have a material impact on the results we present. We
prefer the deflation using import prices (expressed in US dollars), since this brings the observed price index
closest to the corresponding concept in our model, which is the relative price between commodities and a final
tradable consumption good.

moments in the next subsection. We then turn to estimating an SVAR in order to gauge the
effects of exogenous commodity price developments on Argentina’s economy. Furthermore,
we present evidence on the relation of commodity prices and Argentina’s real interest rate
spread. Finally, we summarize the insights of this section into a set of stylized facts.

2.2

Business Cycle Moments

Table 1 summarizes key business cycle moments of Argentina’s economy. We report mean,
standard deviation, persistence, and contemporaneous cross-correlation of GDP growth,
consumption growth, investment growth (all per capita), as well as the trade balance,
defined as exports minus imports scaled by GDP. As the table shows, many properties of
the Argentine business cycle are in line with what is usually observed in advanced economies.
Output, consumption and investment are strongly correlated and investment is much more
volatile than output. On the other hand, there are features that are typically distinctive of
fluctuations in emerging markets. In particular, it is worth highlighting that consumption
growth is more volatile than output growth.11 Furthermore, as often observed in emerging
markets, the trade balance is countercyclical. In the case of Argentina the contemporaneous
correlation with output growth is not large, calculated at -0.07, but the magnitude of the
negative correlation is more pronounced with consumption and investment.

2.3

Commodity Price Shocks and Emerging Economy Business Cycles

In order to gauge the effect of international commodity prices on merging market business
cycles, we consider the following structural vector autoregression (SVAR):

A0 Zt = at + A1 Zt−1 + . . . + Ap Zt−p + ut ,

(1)

where Zt is a vector containing the commodity price index in deviations from mean, as
plotted in Figure 2, together with the log-levels of the business cycle variables of interest 11

Interestingly, the excess volatility of consumption is smaller in our sample than in Garcı́a-Cicco et al.
(2010)’s sample, suggesting that this phenomenon has attenuated in recent years.

structural shocks with covariance matrix E(ut u0t ) = I5 and t is a linear time trend. We set

0 ût and then recover commodity price shocks, that is, the element of ût corresponding
to commodity prices, using restrictions on A0 . Our underlying identifying assumption is that
international commodity prices are not contemporaneously affected by any other variable in
the system. Given that Argentina is a relatively small country which should not be a driver of
world-wide commodity prices, we believe this assumption is reasonable and justifies ordering
the commodity price first in a Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix of Ut .13
The impulse response functions to a one standard deviation shock to commodity prices
are plotted in Figure 3. The results show that there is a statistically and economically
significant positive response of output, consumption and investment following a commodity
price shock. The total trade balance response is negative, that is, net exports fall in response
to a commodity price shock. All responses are hump-shaped with a peak after two years,

commodity prices, which corresponds to an increase of 22% above mean, increases the level
of real GDP per capita by more than one percent.

2.4

Commodity Prices and Interest Rate Spreads

What are possible channels behind the influence of commodity prices on emerging market
business cycles? One key observation that has been highlighted in previous research on
commodity exporting economies is the strong negative comovement of interest rate spreads
and commodity prices.

Fernández et al. (2015) highlight the strong negative effect of

commodity price increases on country risk premia in sovereign bond spreads. Bastourre
et al. (2012) estimate the correlation between a common factor of emerging economy
bond returns and a common factor of commodity prices to be -0.81.
11

Shousha (2016)

emphasizes that the negative correlation is a major difference between emerging and advanced
commodity exporters. Incorporating this effect into our analysis is important, since (strongly
countercyclical) interest rate movements in general have been found to be a key driver of
emerging markets business cycles, see for example Uribe and Yue (2006) and Neumeyer and
Perri (2005).14
To shed further light on the link between the real spread and commodity prices in the
case of Argentina, we run a set of regressions of the Argentine real interest rate spread on the
real commodity price index (in log deviations from its mean). The regressions are specified
as follows:

¯ + βXt + vt ,
rt − rt∗ = α + ξ(lnp̃t − lnp̃)

(2)

where rt is the real interest rate of Argentina, rt∗ is a measure of the world interest rate, p̃t
¯ being the deviation from mean which we plot in
is the commodity price (with (lnp̃t − lnp̃)
Figure 2, Panel (b)), and Xt is a vector of control variables including output growth, the debtto-GDP ratio and the trade balance. The key parameter of interest is ξ which denotes the
sensitivity of the real interest rate spreads with respect to changes in world commodity prices.
Note that this sensitivity parameter will also feature in our model, and we will calibrate it
based on the results presented in this section. Since interest rate data for Argentina are
not available over our baseline 1900-2015 sample, we stick to a smaller time period and try
a collection of different interest rate series available for Argentina. Specifically, we use the
World Bank measure available from 1994 as well as a domestic deposit rate, savings rate and
a money market rate. The latter measures are provided by the IMF International Financial
Statistics.15 For the world interest rate we generally use a measure of the UK real interest
rate published by the Bank of England. We once again emphasize that the commodity price
measure captures international commodity price developments which are arguably exogenous
14

This connects with earlier work on the procyclicality of capital flows and public borrowing in emerging
and developing economies. See for example Kaminsky et al. (2005).
15
We generally use the CPI inflation series provided by Ferreres (2005) and extended forward to obtain a
real measure. For the extension, we tried both official as well as corrected inflation measures (see Cavallo,
2013, for a discussion). The latter usually strengthen the results.

The baselinde results using the World Bank’s real interest rates, are presented in Table
7. We show several other results using different interest rate measures in Appendix B.
Our findings across all regressions, including those in the appendix, point to estimates of
ξ that are typically highly statistically and economically significant, with point estimates
ranging from -0.13 to -0.31. If we consider the lowest estimate (in absolute value) that is
statistically significant, which is -0.199, the interpretation is that a 10 percent deviation
of commodity prices from their long-run mean can move Argentina’s real interest spread
by almost 2 percentage points. We view this as strong evidence in support of a channel
by which exogenous international commodity prices put downward pressure on interest rate
premia faced by commodity exporting emerging economies. This evidence will guide our
modeling choices below, where we also provide further theoretical discussion of this economic
relation.

Based on the empirical analysis above, we summarize the following stylized facts around
aggregate fluctuations in Argentina 1900-2015:
1. A relatively linear trend in GDP per capita at an average of 1.2% yearly growth, with
a relatively constant variance throughtout the period.
2. Excess volatility of consumption over output.
3. A negative correlation between GDP growth and the trade balance.
4. Large of effects of commodity price shocks on all key business cycle variables.
5. A negative relation between interest spreads and commodity prices.

An RBC Model With A Commodity Sector
We build on the small open economy model formulated by Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010).16

Our model adds two elements absent in their analysis. First it allows for a second sector
to capture the distinctive role of commodities in the Argentine economy.

Second, the

model embeds a negative relation between the interest rate premium and commodity prices,
consistent with the empirical evidence presented above. The model nests the various sources
of shocks identified in previous work (see Garcı́a-Cicco et al., 2010 and Aguiar and Gopinath,
2007) and allows for a novel double-role of commodity prices. Increases in commodity prices
improve both the competitiveness of the economy (as Argentina is a net commodity exporter)
and the economy’s borrowing terms, as higher prices are associated with lower spreads
between Argentina’s borrowing rates and the world’s interest rates.
We begin by describing the technology. There are two sectors in the economy: a finalgood sector and a commodity-producing sector. The final good is produced by combining
capital Kt1 , commodity inputs M̃t , and labor Nt1 . It can be consumed, invested and exported
or imported. The production function in the final good sector is

16

We abstract from nominal frictions and the important question of fixed versus nominal exchange rate
choice. See for example Frankel (2004). For a modeling framework that incorporates nominal elements, we
refer readers to Gali and Monacelli (2005) and the literature that built on their seminal contribution.

14

Yt = at (Kt1 )αK (M̃t )αM (Xt Nt1 )1−αK −αM .

(3)

Commodities can be produced domestically using capital Kt2 and labor Nt2 , and can be
used as an intermediate input in final goods production or be traded on international markets.
The production function in the commodity sector is

Ỹt = ãt (Kt2 )α˜K (Xt Nt2 )1−α˜K .

(4)

In the production functions, at and ãt capture total factor productivities (TFP), which
are assumed to be stationary. Xt is the nonstationary level of labor-augmenting technology
common to both sectors. We denote the gross growth rate of the nonstationary technology
as gt = Xt /Xt−1 . Xt is introduced to capture shocks to the trend, which has been a key
focus in the literature on emerging market business cycles.17 The price of the final good is
normalized to 1, and the price of commodities p̃t is exogenously given on world markets and
subject to shocks. We assume that at , ãt , gt and p̃t follow stochastic processes which will be
specified further below.
Firms in both sectors rent capital and hire labor on competitive input markets. The total
stock of capital in the economy Kt is measured in final goods and is divided between the two
production technologies, so that

Kt = Kt1 + Kt2 .

(5)

Capital depreciates at rate δ and is accumulated through investment It which gives

Kt+1 = (1 − δ)Kt + It .

(6)

The economy is populated by a representative household who supplies the two types of

17

See in particular Aguiar and Gopinath (2007). The fact that in our model the nonstationary technology
is common to both sectors ensures that the model admits a non-stochastic balanced growth path (BGP). See

that in equilibrium the expected return on capital will equalize across the two sectors. The
presence of φ > 0 captures investment adjustment costs face by the household.

with γ > 0. In the household’s objective functions β is the discount factor and νt captures
shocks to preferences. The utility function features Greenwood et al. (1988) preferences,
which eliminate the wealth effect on labor supply. Note that the presence of Xt−1 ensures
a constant labor supply along the non-stochastic BGP. The Frisch elasticity of labor supply
will be determined by ω and ω̃, and θ governs the weight on the relative disutility of labor.
Based on the small open economy assumption, the steady state real interest rate is
exogenously given. In particular, rt is determined by the world interest rate r∗ , and a spread
(or premium) term which is further decomposed into three additive terms:



∗
∗
rt = r∗ + ψ eDt+1 /Xt −d − 1 + ξ (ln(p̃t ) − ln(p̃)) + eµt −1 − 1 .

(9)

The first term of the spread in (9) is standard in the literature. Following SchmittGrohe and Uribe (2003), it is assumed that the premium is increasing in the (detrended)
∗
level of debt. The presence of Dt+1
is taken as exogenous by the representative household

16

∗
but Dt+1 = Dt+1
holds in equilibrium. This debt-elastic interest rate ensures a stationary

solution of the model after detrending.18
The second term determining the spread rt −r∗ captures the robust empirical observation,
discussed in detail in Section 2.4, that commodity prices strongly affect interest rate premia
of commodity exporting economies. The parameter ξ represents the sensitivity of the interest
rate spread with respect to commodity price deviations from steady state, and can be
calibrated to the corresponding parameter we estimated in Section 2.4. The assumption
of an interest rate that responds to commodity prices will be important for our main results
concerning the effect of commodity price fluctuations for the economy. Our approach here is
to embed this empirical relationship in a reduced-form fashion. This modeling choice merits
further discussion along two lines.19 First, while we do not provide a fully fledged theory
underlying this relationship, we point out that it is likely to be the result of capital market
imperfections and fluctuations in the value of the country’s collateral. Creditors decrease
the required interest rate premium when commodity prices increase, as the collateral value
of the economy is higher. In Appendix E we illustrate this idea with a simple model, which
gives a flavor of a microfoundation for the postulated relation. Second, we acknowledge
that our modeling choice is restrictive as, in principle, we only allow for only one additional
shock via the last term in the spread (see explanation further below on the role of µt ). This
restrictiveness has the benefit of allowing a direct comparison of the relative importance of
the mechanism we introduce vis-à-vis a collection of exogenous disturbances that are defined
in the same way the existing literature has introduced them.
Finally, the last term in the rate spread in (9) allows for a simple interest rate premium
shock, similar to the one specified in Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010). Since it is central to our
objective to trace out the effects of commodity price movements for the economy, we also
allow for the presence of µt in order to capture possible exogenously driven movements in the
interest premium that are unrelated to commodity prices and thereby avoid hardwiring into

18

See also Lubik (2007) for further discussion.
Note that this way of modeling the relation between rt and p̃t is similar to Shousha (2016), who also
provides further discussion of related empirical evidence.
19

17

the model that interest rate movement must be related to commodity prices.
Equations (3) to (9) feature a set of exogenous disturbances to technology, preferences and
prices, {at , ãt , gt , p̃t , st , νt , µt }, which we specify to follow autoregressive processes in logs that
are subject to stochastic shocks {at , ãt , gt , p̃t , st , νt , µt }. The shocks are normally distributed
with mean zero and standard deviations {σa , σã , σg , σp̃ , σs , σν , σµ }. The processes for gt , st
and p̃t have deterministic means different from 1 that are parametrized as g, s and p̃, and
which will be either estimated or calibrated to match business cycle moments of the steady
state model. We generally specify autoregressive processes of order one but allow the log of
the commodity price p̃t to follow an AR(2). This enables us to calibrate the parameters to
the ones obtained from the SVAR analysis in Section 2.3. The processes are

The complete list of optimality conditions derived in this model is provided in Appendix
C. The Appendix also contains the derivation of a normalized version of the model that is
stationary, that is, where all variables that grow in equilibrium are divided by Xt−1 . This
results in a stationary system in normalized variables, which we denote with lower case letters
and which we solve numerically with standard perturbation techniques. We carry out both a
calibration exercise and a structural estimation of the model in order to asses the quantitative
contribution of different shocks to fluctuations in the main macroeconomic aggregates.

Calibration and Business Cycle Characteristics
The goal of this section is to study the business cycle characteristics of the model that are

induced by shocks to the commodity price. To do so, we calibrate all structural parameters
of the model, including the parameters governing the stochastic process of ln(p̃t ). We then
generate impulse response functions and theoretical business cycle moments of the model,
focusing exclusively on commodity price shocks.

19

4.1

Calibration

Table 3 summarizes our baseline calibration. Many of the parameter values are standard in
business cycle research, but several are worth highlighting. Both the mean of the commodity
sector productivity ãt as well as the steady state relative price of commodities p̃ determine
the relative size of the two sectors in the economy. We have normalized the mean technology
in both sectors to 1 - as can be seen in equations (10) and (11) - and find the value of p̃ that
matches the ratio net exports of commodities to GDP observed in Argentine data (8.60%).20
This pins down the relative size of the commodity price sector that is in line with Argentine
data. The parameter d∗ in equation (9) is calibrated to match the average trade balance
to output ratio in the data (-0.041%, consistent with Table 1). We calibrate the mean of
the government spending process to match the average government spending to GDP ratio
observed in the data (9.38%). The parameter ξ, which governs the sensitivity of the interest
rate spread to commodity prices, is calibrated to the value obtained from the regressions in
Section 2.4. To be conservative, we take the lower bound of -0.199 among the statistically
significant estimates we have obtained across a broad range of regression specifications. The
average technology growth rate of the economy g is set directly to 1.0117 in order to generate
the observed mean output growth in the data. We impose equal capital shares in both
sectors (αk = α̃k ) and set the commodity share in the final goods production to αm = 0.05
following Shousha (2016). ψ is typically set to a small value which in the small open economy
literature (see e.g. Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2003). The estimation results of Garcı́a-Cicco
et al. (2010), however, highlight that the data supports a larger value of this parameter. In
particular, a large value is necessary to generate a standard deviation of the trade balance
roughly as big as the one of output growth and a decreasing autocorrelation function of the
trade balance. We therefore set ψ = 2.8 in line with their posterior estimate.21 We set
the adjustment cost parameter to φ = 6, slightly higher than in previous papers because
20

To compute this target ratio in the data, we use a broad measure of commodity exports which includes
manufactures of commodities. Due to data availability we use an annual sample starting in 1980.
21
Other than matching moments of the trade balance, setting the value to 0.001 as in Aguiar and Gopinath
(2007) gives very similar results. In our estimation exercise, we estimate ψ, similar to Garcı́a-Cicco et al.
(2010).

20

this reduces the impact response to commodity shocks (Lower values would overstate the
effect of commodity prices).22 The stochastic process of ln(p̃t ) is calibrated to be in line
with the estimated SVAR coefficients in Section 2.3, which gives ρ1p̃ = 0.95, ρ2p̃ = −0.13 and
σp̃ = 0.1064.

Impulse Response Functions to Commodity Price Shocks

Figure 4 displays the impulse response functions to a one-standard deviation commodity
price shock p̃t , using the calibration described above. The figure shows that the responses
on impact are in line with the stylized facts of the business cycle of Argentina highlighted in
Section 2. Positive commodity price shocks boost the economy by increasing total output,

response is larger in magnitude than the output response. The total trade balance response
is negative, rendering total net exports countercyclical.

To understand the mechanism behind the dynamics visible in Figure 4, note that
commodity prices in the model give rise to two effects.

The first effect goes through

commodity trade revenues. The economy needs to trade off the cost of more expensive
commodity inputs in the production of final goods with the benefits of being able to produce
and export commodities at higher prices (thus generating trade revenues). The second effect
is governed by the negative sensitivity of the interest spread rt −r∗ to commodity price shocks
present in equation (9) and based on the empirical evidence in Section 2.4. Both of these
effects are necessary to generate the responses in Figure 4. To highlight this, Figures 5 and
6 open up the double role of commodity prices in our model by plotting impulse response
functions for the two effects separately and inspecting them across the two sectors of the
economy. In both cases, the responses of consumption and investment growth are omitted.

22

Figure 5 studies the first effect of commodity price shocks, which we dub “competitiveness
effect.” The figure plots the responses of GDP and the total trade balance to a commodity
price shock when setting ξ = 0, that is, shutting off the channel through the interest rate,
which we will analyze separately below. It also breaks down these responses into the dynamics
in both sectors, i.e. the final goods sector and the commodity sector, separately. What the
left panels of the figure reveal is that after a commodity prices increase, the value-added in
the commodity sector increases significantly, as higher international prices make it attractive
to increase production and exports. The final goods sector actually suffers, as intermediate
commodity inputs necessary to produce final goods become more expensive. However this
effect is dwarfed by the boom in the commodity sector and total production in the economy
increases. The trade balances in the two sectors, shown in the right panels of the figure, go
into different directions. The economy starts exporting more commodities and importing final
goods as the former are very attractive to sell abroad and the letter less attractive to produce
domestically. Looking at the two sectors together, the total trade surplus increases with
the commodity price increase. This highlights that the first effect alone does not generate a
countercylical total trade balance, which is a salient feature in emerging economy business
cycle data.
Let us turn to Figure 6, in which the dynamics arising from the second effect, which
we call “borrowing cost effect” are presented. The figure plots the IRFs of total GDP
and the total trade balance to a simple interest rate shock. This shock is (qualitatively)
isomorphic to an increase in commodity prices that only goes through the presence of p̃t
in equation (9) but that does not directly affect production in either sector.23

It thus

completely shuts off the competitiveness effect described above and only shows the effect
that commodity price increases have through their indirect effect on bringing down the spread
between the economy’s borrowing rate and the world interest rate. Again, the figure breaks
down these responses into the dynamics in both sectors, that is, the final goods sector and
the commodity sector, separately. The figure shows that the exogenous fall in borrowing
23

For the purpose of the comparison below, the standard deviation of the interest rate shock is calibrated
to have the same maximum output response as the total response in Figure 4. The persistence is set to 0.9.

rates allows households and firms to bring resources to the present by borrowing funds and
decreasing the final goods trade balance, that is, importing final goods. Some of these
resources will be consumed (consumption goes up on impact, not shown in the figure), and
some will be invested into capital (investment goes up on impact, not shown in the figure)
in order to produce final goods and maintain a smooth path of consumption. Some of the
capital will also be used to produce commodities, which are a required intermediary input
to final goods production. This gives a slow and hump-shaped increase in the GDP of both
sectors and the total economy. Hence, the total trade balance falls and output increases, but
not on impact. This lack of impact response in output stands in contrast with the empirical
impulse responses and suggests that this channel alone cannot mimic the data.
In conclusion, the double-role of commodity effects in our model, through the joint
presence of competitiveness and the borrowing cost effect, gives rise to dynamics that are very
well in line with the empirical facts in Argentina (and other commodity export dependent
emerging economies by extension), as shown by comparing the SVAR results from Figure 3

Theoretical Moments

Maintaining the thought experiment that there are only commodity price shocks, what are
the implied theoretical business cycle moments of our model? Table 4 reports the standard
deviation, persistence and cross-correlation of the growth rate of GDP, consumption and
investment, as well as the total trade balance to GDP. These are the theoretical concepts in
the model that represent the analogues of the empirical time series displayed in Table 1.24
As the table shows, commodity price shocks alone are successful at generating some of the
distinctive features of the Argentine business cycle: Excess volatility of consumption over
output, volatile investment, and a countercylical trade balance. It also generates a volatility
of the trade balance similar to that of output growth and a persistence in the trade balance

24

Note that the system is solved in the normalized variables, as described in Appendix C. The growth rates
of the original non-normalized variables can be recovered from those of the normalized variables by adding gt .

25

well below unity, two key features highlighted by Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010).
Quantitatively, a considerable fraction of the standard deviation of the variables appears
to be accounted for by commodity price shocks. In the case of GDP growth, for example,
this is 1.69% compared to 5.27% in the data. This already hints that a potentially significant
fraction of output fluctuations in reality could be captured by international commodity
price movements. The model hit by commodity price shocks overstates the size of the
countercylcality of the trade balance. It also misses the persistence and some of the volatility
in investment. However, recall that a variety of other disturbances in the model have been
held constant when computing these moments. We emphasize again that the focus of the
calibration exercise in this section lies on explaining the dynamics that arise from commodity
shocks alone. This is done to highlight our mechanism in light of the facts present in the
data.25 In order to systematically gauge the fraction of aggregate fluctuations that can be
accounted for by commodity price shocks, we move on to estimating the model in the next
section.

Estimation:

Assessing the Quantitative Contribution of

Different Sources of Shocks in Emerging Economies
In this section our goal is to assess the quantitative contribution of different shocks to
aggregate fluctuations in emerging economies for which commodity exports are potentially
important. To do so, we take the model to Argentine data and structurally estimate it
with the goal of running a “horse race” between the various shocks that possibly drive the
business cycle. We maintain the calibration of most of the parameters (see Table 3), and
estimate the stochastic processes of the exogenous disturbances defined by equations (10)
to (16). In addition, we also estimate two key structural parameters. The first is at the
heart of our mechanism: ξ, which governs the sensitivity of the real interest rate spread to
commodity prices. Estimating this parameter allows the data to speak about the strength of
this mechanism within our model structure. Furthermore, we estimate ψ, a parameter that
has been highlighted in Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010) who emphasize its role in capturing trade
balance dynamics in the economy. In carrying out the estimation exercise presented below,
we give equal footing to all different shocks in the model, which correspond to the typical
candidates previously proposed in the literature.

5.1

Estimation Specification

We carry out a Bayesian estimation defining standard priors on the estimated parameters.
We run a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to obtain draws from the marginal
posterior distributions of the parameters.26 We then recompute business cycle moments and
carry out forecast error variance decompositions as well as historical variance decompositions
of the observables at the estimated posterior modes. To estimate the model we add the

26

We take 10 million draws. We discard the first 25% of draws and keep the remaining ones for inference.
The acceptance ratio is 27.3%.

following measurement equations

∆lnYtGDP,obs = lnYtGDP − lnYt−1

(21)

∆lnCtobs = lnCt − lnCt−1

(22)

∆lnItobs = lnIt − lnIt−1

(23)

T B T otal,obs /YtGDP,obs = T BtT otal /YtGDP ,

(24)

where ∆lnYtGDP,obs , ∆lnCtobs , ∆lnItobs and ∆T B T otal,obs correspond to the empirically
observed time series which we analyzed in Section 2.27 The variables on the right hand side of
equations (21) to (24) are model concepts defined in Section 3.28 As explained above, we keep
the calibration for most of the parameters and estimate only the parameters governing the
stochastic processes of all shocks as well as ξ and ψ. Table 5 summarizes the priors imposed
on the parameters. As is standard for the estimation of DSGE models, we use beta priors
on the persistence parameters and inverse-gamma priors on the standard deviations. The
parameter values of the priors are the same as in Smets and Wouters (2007) and a number
of related papers, except for the commodity price process. Since the latter is specified as
an AR(2), we use priors that at the mode impose the same maximum root as for the other
disturbances.29 We set identical scale parameters on the standard deviation of the shocks to
be remain relatively agnostic about the relative importance of the different shocks. We put
a normal prior on ξ, which is centered around the smallest statistically significant regression
estimate from Section 2.4, with the standard deviation equal to the standard error obtained
from the regression. Finally, our prior on ψ, also normal, is centered around the estimate
obtained by Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010).
27

In principle we could add the commodity price series which we used for parts of the calibration of the
model, as an observable. However, since the Grilli and Yang (1988) may capture some dynamics unrelated
to prices actually faced by Argentina, and an Argentina-specific index is only available for a much shorter
sample, our preferred specification is to estimate the model without this observable and then compare the
model-implied commodity price process with the empirically observed index. See the discussion further below.
28
Note that while we solve the (linearized) model in variables that are normalized by Xt−1 (see Appendix C),

Estimation Results

How large is the contribution of different structural shocks to the variation in output,
consumption, investment and the trade balance in emerging economies? We address this
question using the results in Table 6. Panel (a) in the table shows the results of an (infinite
horizon) forecast error variance decomposition based on the posterior estimates obtained from
estimating our model on Argentine data in the period 1900-2015.30 For each of the variables
used as observables, this gives the share of variation that can be explained by a particular
shock. We begin by focusing on the commodity price shock, as this is the novelty we are
aiming to bring in with respect to work that is in similar spirit to our analysis. As the table
reveals, a sizable fraction of output (21.67%), consumption (24.02%) and investment growth
(34.11%) can be explained by commodity price shocks. This confirms the intuition we derived
from the calibration exercise and from the quantitatively large responses that were present
in our SVAR analysis.
Turning to the other shocks, the table shows that our estimation attributes most of the
variation in output growth (51.15%) to transitory technology shocks (the table reports the

joint contribution of at and ãt ). This finding is in line with Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010).
We do not, however, confirm their conclusion with respect to a very small contribution
of shock to nonstationary technology à la Aguiar and Gopinath (2007).

We find the

contribution of these shocks to still be very sizable, explaining 20.55% of the variation in
output growth in Argentina.31 Preference shocks and interest shocks also play an important
role in understanding the business cycle. The former, affecting directly the intertemporal
choices of the household, explains in particular consumption growth and the trade balance
variation, while the later contributes substantially to the variance in investment growth. The
government spending (endowment) shock is generally found to be unimportant, which is also
in line with the previous literature.
To shed further light on our findings with respect to commodity prices, in Figure 7 we
plot two series. The first series, indicated with the dashed black line, corresponds to the
model-implied commodity price process, that is, the time series of p̃t obtained from feeding
the estimated shocks p̃t into equation (16) and setting the parameters ρ1p̃ and ρ2p̃ to their
31

Interestingly, Akinci (2017) also finds both types of technology shocks to be important in the context of a
model which features financial frictions and time-varying risk premia but does not have a role for commodity
prices.

estimated posterior mode. The second series, indicated with a solid blue line, shows the real
commodity price index, which we have plotted and used for calibrating parts of the model
above. It is visible that, reassuringly, the two time series broadly share common features,
such as a similar volatility and often reasonably synchronized movements. While this is quite
visible in the post-1950 period, it is less the case for the war and interwar period, where large
level differences between the two price series are visible. We conjecture that this may be due
to different limitations of our analysis. For example, the wars may have been special periods
which have produced swings in trade and commodity prices that were not connected in the
way our theory would prescribe. (Trade barriers fluctuated significantly during this period,
opening a volatile gap between international commodity prices and the actual prices received
by Argentine producers.) Furthermore, we point out that the commodity price index by Grilli
and Yang (1988) captures world commodity prices and not necessarily those commodity prices
faced by Argentina. With financial integration, the global cross section of commodity prices

31

has become more correlated over time and thus may render the index a concept that is more
closely related to the actual commodity prices faced by Argentina in the later parts of the
estimation sample. Given these concerns, we also re-estimated the model using the same
data, but based on a shorter sample from 1950 to 2015. The results of the forecast error
variance decomposition are shown in Table 6, Panel (b). In this sample, the quantitative
contribution of commodity price shocks is estimated to be even larger. Commodity price
shocks explain 37.97% of the variance in output growth, 42.28% in consumption growth and
61.11% in investment growth. The relative importance between the other shocks remains
broadly similar in this sample.
In addition to the decomposition given in Table 6, which is a theoretical object computed
at the posterior modes, it is also possible to construct a historical variance decomposition
which breaks down the movements of a variable at a given point in the actual data sample into
the contribution of the different shocks. Figure 8 presents such a historical decomposition for
Argentine output growth from 1900 to 2015. The black line displays the actual time series
of growth in real GDP per capita, which is used as one of the observables in the estimation.
The colored bars represent the contribution of different shocks to the movements in the
output time series at given points in time. Overall, the figure mirrors the insights from Table
6, given that the orange and (dark) blue bars, that is, commodity and technology shocks
capture most of the variation in output growth. Figure 8 in addition enables us to inspect
particular episodes in the economic history of Argentina and interpret them through the lens
of our model.
Taken together, our results suggest that commodity prices should feature prominently
in the analysis of business cycles in emerging economies that are dependent on commodity
exports. In terms of quantitative contribution, they are among the three most important
shocks in driving output growth in Argentina.

Importantly, shocks to international

commodity prices, in contrast to inherently very different concepts such as domestic TFP
shocks, are easier to measure and identify, and eventually act upon, by policy makers.

is due to the fact that the data is not at the model-implied steady state values at the beginning of the sample.

Conclusion
This paper has sought to answer a classical question in international macroeconomics:

what causes the large swings in economic activity in emerging markets? The literature has
proposed a variety of sources of shocks, but remains split on the answers. We study the
question anew, using a model that nests the previous sources of shocks advanced in the
literature and adds two elements absent from the previous analysis. First, it allows for a
second sector to capture the separate role of commodities in the economy. Specifically, the
analysis focuses on the case of a net commodity exporting country, facing exogenous price
changes. Second, the model embeds a negative relation between the interest rate premium
and commodity prices, which we show is consistent with the empirical evidence. Exogenous
increases in commodity prices improve both the competitiveness of the economy and the
economy’s borrowing terms through the negative effect of higher prices on the spread between
the country’s borrowing rates and world interest rates. Both effects jointly result in strongly
positive effects of commodity price movements on GDP, consumption and investment, and a
negative effect on the total trade balance. They also generate excess volatility of consumption
over output and a large volatility of investment.
We estimate the model using data on Argentina from 1900 to 2015 to provide a
quantitative evaluation of the various sources of shocks and their effect on macroeconomic
aggregates over a long time horizon. Our estimate of the contribution of commodity price
shocks to fluctuations in output growth of Argentina is in the order of 22%. Furthermore,
commodity prices account for 24% and and 34% of the variation in consumption and
investment growth, respectively. The contribution of these shocks is even bigger on a post1950 data sample, accounting for 34% of the variance of output growth, 42% of consumption
and 61% of investment. We also find a role for non-stationary productivity shocks - much
smaller than Aguiar and Gopinath (2007), though bigger than Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010) and a role for stationary productivity shocks, consistent with previous findings.
Though in this paper we do not address normative issues, the results offer hope. Insofar
as part of the cycle can be accounted for observable variables (world commodity prices)
34

that cannot be manipulated for political goals, contingent macroeconomic policies can be
implemented to help mitigate the cycle. Given the nature of the driver, sovereign wealth
funds may offer a promising avenue for tackling volatility in commodity producing countries
like Argentina.

Details on Data

GDP and its components
Data on real GDP, Investment, Consumption, Government Spending and Net Exports
from 1900 through to 2009 come from Ferreres (2005) - Ferreres has extended these series to
2009. We extend the data further to 2015 using the corresponding series from the Argentine
Finance Ministry “Ministerio de Economia (Ejecución Presupuestaria de la Administración
Nacional),” available online. The growth rate of the latter series was applied to Ferreres’
2009 figure.

Commodity Prices
Data on world commodity prices are based on the Grilli and Yang (1988) commodity
price index series updated by Pfaffenzeller et al. (2007), which runs from 1900 through to
2011. We update the series to 2015, following Pfaffenzeller et al. (2007)’s procedure.
The Argentina-specific price index is constructed using Argentine export weights available
in the UN Comtrade data base. We match these weights with commodity-specific price
indeces provided by the World Bank. This is done for the broad commodity categories fuel,
timber, food, beverages and fertilizer from 1962.
As a deflator for the commodity price series we use the index of US-dollar import prices
for Argentina provided by Pfaffenzeller et al. (2007), which we update till 2015 using the
figures from INDEC. For robustness we also tried manufacturing prices (expressed in US
dollars), and the US consumer price index, available via FRED.

World Real Interest Rate
To measure global real interest rates we use the UK nominal interest rate series published
by the Bank of England from 1900 through 2015 and subtract the UK inflation rate provided
by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).

39

Domestic Real Interest Rates
We use various series on real interest rates for Argentina, as described in the text. The
World Bank provides a real interest rate series available from 1994. The IMF International
Financial Statistics publishes series of nominal domestic deposit rate, savings rate and money
market rate, which we deflate using CPI inflation from Ferreres (2005) until 2009, and then
update using the 2009-2015 series from www.inflacionverdadera.com. We also used the latter
series to deflate the interest rate for the period from 2006 onwards.

Government Debt
Data on Debt to GDP ratios come from Argentina’s statistical office, INDEC (Online,
Table 7.10).

using the fact that gt = Xt /Xt−1 , the first-order conditions (31) to (36) can be rewritten in

balance and GDP of the economy can be calculated accordingly.

C.3

Steady state

To compute the steady state, we can proceed as follows:
1. Drop all time subscripts.
2. Steady state must fulfill r = r∗ = β1 g −γ − 1 and d = d∗ from (40) and (47).
3. Solve (43) for the steady state capital-labor ratio in the commodity sector as a function
of primitives
4. Combine (37) and (38) through λ. Plug in the capital-labor ratio. It is possible to solve
analytically for N 2 as a function of primitives. Using the capital-labor ratio, can solve
for k 2 .
5. Combine (37), (39), (41), and (42) to eliminate λ, k 1 , m̃. Obtain an equation for N 1
as an implicit function of primitives. Solve this equation for N 1 numerically.
6. Use the equations combined in the previous step to solve for k 1 and m̃ given the solution
for N 1 .
7. Use the budget constraint to solve for c.

Interest rate premia and commodity prices: Simple formal illustration
Suppose there is a borrower who borrows amount Dt . With probability λ she is able to

repay in full. With probability 1 − λ only a repayment smaller than the borrowed amount
Dt can be made. This repayment is a fraction φ of commodity output p̃t ỹt (equivalently,
p̃t ỹt can be thought of as collateral which the lender can seize when full repayment is not
possible). The presence of a risk-neutral lender who herself can obtain funds at the risk-free
rate r∗ and who faces perfect competition, will result in the following zero profit condition:

(1 + r∗ )Dt = λ(1 + rt )Dt + (1 − λ)φp̃t ỹt ,

(48)

which can be rearranged to

rt =

1 + r∗ 1 − λ
−
φp̃t ỹt − 1.
λ
λDt

(49)

As can be seen from (49), an increase in p̃t reduces the interest rate rt , ceteris paribus.
This is the key assumption of our model we aim to rationalize with the above illustration.
Furthermore, and also consistent with our formulation in (9), rt is increasing in the level of
debt Dt .
