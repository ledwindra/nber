    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the impact of economic crisis on health in Mexico. There have been four wide-scale economic crises in Mexico in the past two decades, the most recent in 1995-96.  We find that mortality rates for the very young and the elderly increase or decline less rapidly in crisis years as compared with non-crisis years.  In late 1995-96 crisis, mortality rates were about 5 to 7 percent higher in the crisis years compared to the years just prior to the crisis.  This translates into a 0.4 percent increase in mortality for the elderly and a 0.06 percent increase in mortality for the very young.  We find tentative evidence that economic crises affect mortality by reducing incomes and possibly by placing a greater burden on the medical sector, but not by forcing less healthy members of the population to work or by forcing primary caregivers to go to work.\n\n",
