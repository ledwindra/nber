    "abstract": "\n\nWe extend our recent work measuring the cost of capital in Japan and the United States by considering several questions that such results raised. Among our findings are:\n(1) The small firm - large firm distinction appears to be more significant in Japan, not in the United States;\n(2) Correcting Japanese accounting statements for cross-holding raises the estimated Japanese cost-of-capital by about 1 percentage point;\n(3) Correcting Japanese accounting statements for unmeasured returns to land has a significantly more important effect: the most conservative correction we attempt raises the implied Japanese return to capital to parity with the United States during the mid-1980's.\n\n",
