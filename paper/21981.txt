Does Government Intervention Affect Banking Globalization?
Anya Kleymenova, Andrew K. Rose, and Tomasz Wieladek
NBER Working Paper No. 21981
February 2016
JEL No. F36,G28
ABSTRACT
Using data from British and American banks, we provide empirical evidence that government intervention
affects banking globalization along three dimensions: depth, breadth and persistence. We examine
depth by studying whether a bank’s preference for domestic, as opposed to external, lending (funding)
changes when it is subjected to a large public intervention, such as bank nationalization. Our results
suggest that, following nationalization, non-British banks allocate their lending away from the UK
and increase their external funding. Second, we find that nationalized banks from the same country
tend to have portfolios of foreign assets that are spread across countries in a way that is far more similar
than either private banks from the same country or nationalized banks from different countries, consistent
with an impact on the breadth of globalization. Third, we study the Troubled Asset Relief Program
(TARP) to examine the persistence of the effect of large government interventions. We find weak
evidence that upon entry into the TARP, foreign lending declines but domestic does not. This effect
is observable at the aggregate level, and seems to disappear upon TARP exit. Collectively, this evidence
suggests that large government interventions affect the depth and breadth of banking globalization,
but may not persist after public interventions are unwound.

1. Introduction
International financial intermediation has changed significantly since the 2007-2009 global
financial crisis: portfolio flows have taken up the slack left by the collapse in bank lending. 1 Several
reasons have been proposed for this development, including a) a rise in bank regulation, b) weakness in
loan demand, and c) political interference in banking as a result of government intervention. 2 In this
paper, we explore the last explanation.
We hypothesize that public intervention can affect the amount (depth), cross-country allocation
(breadth), and persistence of banks’ external activities. We employ three different empirical
approaches. First, we use the same bank-level balance sheet data from the Bank of England that Rose
and Wieladek (2014) used to analyze the effect of bank nationalization on assets, but we examine the
depth effects of large public interventions on the composition of domestic and foreign bank liabilities.
Second, we assess to what extent bank nationalization leads to the convergence (breadth) of banks’
cross-border portfolios when the affected banks are from the same country. Finally, we study whether
these effects persist or disappear following the unwinding of government interventions. Given the
significant number of foreign and domestic banks with substantial lending to/funding from a large and
diverse number of countries, the UK banking system provides an ideal empirical setup to test the first
two hypotheses. To our knowledge, the only large recent public capital injection that has been unwound
on a wide scale is the American Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Accordingly, we test the
persistence hypothesis using American data.
Government intervention may affect the depth of banking globalization. On the asset side of a
bank’s balance sheet, a disproportionate reduction in external (as opposed to domestic) lending
following nationalization constitutes prima facie evidence of a negative impact on banking globalization,
referred to as “financial protectionism” by Rose and Wieladek (2014). In a crisis, nationalized banks are

2

also perceived to be the safest home for deposits, as they are owned and backed by the government.
Unsurprisingly, Berger and Roman (2015) find that the TARP gave participating institutions a competitive
advantage in raising deposits, mainly because those banks were perceived to be safer. Similarly,
following the introduction of TARP, Acharya and Mora (2015) document a “flight to safety” effect in that
previously liquidity-constrained banks experienced an increase in deposits. This suggests that banks
which received government aid may have been faced with an excess supply of deposits. That is,
government intervention may induce banks to accept more domestic, as opposed to external, deposits.
Our analysis of British data clearly indicates that government interventions affect banking globalization
on both the asset and liability sides.
Large banks, such as those in our sample, usually lend (and borrow) in many different foreign
countries. The mix of these assets (breadth) across countries differs by bank for a variety of reasons,
often having to do with the particular regional or industrial expertise of the bank. For example,
Standard Chartered is a large UK bank whose lending is primarily focused on Asia; Santander, a Spanish
bank with substantial operations in Latin America, is now the third largest mortgage lender in the UK.
For any given pair of banks, the similarity in exposure to different countries (which we refer to as ‘the
asset mix’) can be measured quantitatively; we use the general measure of cosine similarity. We study
similarity of the asset mix across pairs of banks, after abstracting from dyadic fixed effects and common
trends. In particular, we ask if the asset mix converges when a pair of banks from the same country is
nationalized. If the public authorities from a certain country who take charge of a bank upon
nationalization simply shrink the size of the balance sheet of a bank, there is no reason to expect the
asset mix for a pair of nationalized banks from the same country to begin to converge. Similarly, if good
and bad assets are randomly distributed across countries, banks will not begin to look more similar upon
nationalization. Even if bad assets are concentrated in a particular country, there would be no reason
why the reduction in lending should be different for nationalized (as opposed to private sector) banks.
3

But if the authorities impose their political preferences on nationalized banks, leading to a reduction in
lending to a particular set of countries, then one might expect bank nationalization to result in crosscountry asset portfolios that diverge if the nationalized banks are from different countries but converge
if nationalized banks are from the same country. This is, in fact, exactly what we find in the data.
Finally, we examine the persistence of the depth effect. Unlike banks in other countries that
received public support during the global financial crisis, most American banks have now repaid the
funds they received through TARP. This makes the TARP an ideal intervention to study, since bias
towards foreign lending could either persist or disappear following TARP exit. To allow us to assess
whether banks’ lending preferences were indeed affected by their presence in TARP, we compare the
growth of foreign as opposed to domestic lending, upon TARP entry and exit. We find some evidence
that banks seemed to discriminate against foreign lending after entry into TARP, but there is also
evidence (albeit weaker) that this was reversed upon TARP exit. This is consistent with the idea that the
effects of large public interventions (such as partial government bank ownership) dissipate after the
intervention has ended. These effects are small, though not trivial. A counterfactual exercise suggests
that aggregate US foreign lending would have been 3.3% higher in the absence of TARP. This suggests
that once public interventions are unwound globally, growth rates in cross-border bank lending may
return to those observed before the crisis. Although, all our TARP results on persistence are
economically small and statistically marginal (in marked contrast to our British results on depth and
breadth); they are consistent with temporary financial protectionism, and none are significantly
inconsistent with the notion.
Our paper contributes to a growing literature that analyzes the impact of large public
interventions on banks’ financial activity. Most previous work examines the impact on domestic bank
lending, resilience and deposits. For example, Giannetti and Laeven (2012) find that the collapse of the

4

global syndicated lending market can be partially explained by lenders rebalancing their portfolios in
favor of domestic borrowers. Veronesi and Zingales (2010) study the costs and benefits of US banks’
recapitalization following the first phase of the US TARP while Cornett, Li, and Tehranian (2013), Ivashina
and Scharfstein (2010), and Duchin and Sosyura (2014) examine the effect on the type and quality of
domestic lending by American banks following the receipt of TARP funds. In contrast, we examine the
extent to which banks discriminate against foreign customers, whether borrowers or depositors,
following large interventions such as nationalization or a public capital injection.
Our findings also contribute to the literature on international cross-border flows following the
financial crisis which documents that internationally-active banks reduced their cross-border lending
during the financial crisis in favor of domestic borrowers (Cerutti and Claessens, 2014; Cerutti, Claessens
and Ratnovski, 2014, De Haas and Van Horen, 2012; Giannetti and Laeven, 2012). Our results suggest
that large government interventions play a role in affecting the depth and breadth of external bank
lending (banking globalization), but we also find some evidence, albeit weak, that these effects do not
persist once government interventions are reversed.

2. Examining the Depth Effect for British Bank Assets and Liabilities
In this section, we provide evidence for the depth effect of bank assets and liabilities. Given the
presence of a large number of domestic and foreign banks that engage in significant external lending,
the UK banking system is an ideal place to test this hypothesis. In a similar vein, Rose and Wieladek
(2014) examined the asset side of the depth effect and estimated the effects of large public
interventions on the “loan mix”, defined as the ratio of foreign asset to total assets. We now reestimate the model proposed in their paper with an updated data set below. More importantly, we also
estimate the effect of large public interventions on the analogous “liability mix”, which is defined as the
5

ratio of foreign liabilities to total liabilities. (For the sake of completeness, we also use the difference
between the two to construct net foreign exposure.) To account for the many reasons loan and
liabilities mixes vary across time and banks, we include comprehensive sets of bank- and time-specific
fixed effects.
Data and Methodology
Our investigation uses quarterly data from the Bank of England, covering all banks doing
business in the UK. London’s status as a major international financial center means that the UK’s
banking system has considerable diversity, which enables us to examine the impact of government
interventions on banking globalization for British and foreign banks. While the data are confidential, the
scope and coverage of these data mean that this data set is better suited to test our hypothesis of
interest than any other dataset, to the best if our knowledge. Our data set includes complete balance
sheet data for every institution in the UK banking sector; in particular, we rely on series from the Bank of
England’s BT, AL, CC and CL forms (details are relegated to the data appendix). 3 Our data set also
includes hand-collected series of large public banking interventions, in particular: 1) nationalizations, 2)
injections of public capital, and 3) unusual access to loans, guarantees, or liquidity. We focus on bank
nationalizations in our empirical work, since this is a clear-cut, discrete, one-time event; it is also the
most obvious public intervention likely to result in detectable impact. Our panel of data covers 334
banks between 1999Q1 and 2011Q4. Our data set has three disadvantages: a) the data set is available
at the level of individual banks, precluding analysis of bilateral relationships between individual banks
and borrowers; b) the data set covers only the part of the banking group which is UK-resident; and c) the
data set is confidential. Further details on the data set are contained in Rose and Wieladek (2014). The
only new variable of substance compared to Rose and Wieladek (2014) is the pair of regressands that
involve liabilities and net exposures. In our dataset, total liabilities are defined as the sum of all bank

6

funding, including capital. External liabilities are defined as total funding due to non-residents. 4 We use
the ratio of the latter with respect to the former as the dependent variable in our regression model.
We analyze our data set using the following simple panel data model:
Fori,t/(Domi,t+Fori,t) = αi + βt + γUKNatUK,i,t + γFORNatFOR,i,t + θUKLLUK,i,t + θFORLLFOR,i,t
+ ζUKCapUK,i,t + ζFORCapFOR,i,t + εi,t,

(1)

where:
•

Fori,t is lending to (or borrowing from) foreign residents by bank i at time t;

•

Domi,t is lending to (or borrowing from) domestic (British) residents by bank i at time t;

•

αi is a set of bank-specific fixed effects;

•

βt is an analogous set of time fixed effects;

•

NatUK,i,t is a dummy variable that takes a value of one when British bank i is nationalized at or
before time t, and zero otherwise;

•

NatFOR,i, t is a dummy variable that takes a value of one when a foreign bank i is nationalized at or
before time t and zero otherwise;

•

LLUK,i,t, LLFOR,i,t, CapUK,i,t and CapFOR,i,t are analogues for banks that receive unusual access to
liquidity or loan guarantees (LL) or are the recipients of public capital injections (Cap);

•

εi,t is a well-behaved disturbance term; and

•

γUK, γFOR, θUK, θFOR, ζUK, and ζFOR are coefficients.

The coefficients of greatest interest to us are γUK and γFOR, which measure the permanent effect of bank
nationalization on the mix of foreign to total borrowing (or lending). We note that our regressands are
unaffected by proportionate changes in total lending (or borrowing). Our approach therefore picks up

7

changes in the composition, rather than the quantity, of lending. We estimate our model with least
squares; the presence of comprehensive sets of both bank- and time-specific fixed effects means that
our model can be interpreted as a difference-in-differences estimator, comparing the foreign mixes of
assets (and liabilities) for nationalized and private banks, before and after nationalization. Foreign
banking activity may be intrinsically more “footloose” than domestic; the question we ask is whether
there is a systematic difference between banks that were nationalized and those that remained private.
Results
Our default results are tabulated in Table 1. Each column presents key coefficient estimates
from (1) with a different regressand (tabulated in the top row). Perhaps the effects of greatest interest
to us are those in the top row, representing estimates of γ, the permanent effect of foreign bank
nationalization on the ratio of foreign to total assets, liabilities and net exposures. Consider the top-left
coefficient; this indicates that foreign bank nationalization raises the mix of foreign to total assets by
around 15%. This is an economically significant amount, comparable to those of Rose and Wieladek
(2014), and is consistent with the hypothesis that government intervention has an adverse impact on
banking globalization; external lending is cut back more than domestic lending. The effect is statistically
significant; the robust t-ratio is 2.35, inconsistent with the null hypothesis of no effect at the 2%
significance level. It is striking that the effect of nationalization of a British bank is insignificant in both
the economic and statistical senses. Indeed, the only other statistically significant effect on the asset
mix is the much smaller effect of a capital injection into a British bank; this effect is economically
smaller; it also turns out to be more fragile. All these results are consistent with those presented in
Rose and Wieladek (2014).
What of the liabilities side? Here we find similar, and again striking, results. When a foreign
bank is nationalized, it increases the fraction of its foreign liabilities by around 14%, almost exactly the
8

same as the increase in foreign assets; this is an effect that is both statistically and economically
significant. Not only do nationalized foreign banks tilt their lending practices away from the UK; they
also tilt their borrowing away, and to a similar degree. These results are not mechanically implied by
those on the asset side. While, in an accounting sense, total assets need to equal total liabilities plus
shareholders’ equity, there can be stark differences in the composition because assets in one country
can be financed with liabilities from another. In the presence of time effects, our results on the
liabilities side can be interpreted as reflecting a bank’s demand for UK versus foreign deposits. And in
times of uncertainty, nationalized banks provide the safest home for deposits essentially by definition.
A rise in foreign nationalized bank preference for foreign, as opposed to British, deposits is therefore
consistent with the idea that government interventions may have an adverse impact on banking
globalization. 5 Since the mix of foreign assets and liabilities increases similarly upon nationalization, it is
little surprise that there is no significant effect of nationalization on the net foreign exposure of the
nationalized banks. We also find an economically smaller (but statistically significant) effect of foreign
capital injections on the ratio of foreign to total liabilities.
In Table 2, we show that our results of γUK and γFOR are insensitive to a large number of
perturbations to the exact estimation technique. We record our default nationalization estimates in the
top row to ease comparison. We then tabulate four types of robustness checks to account for sensitivity
with respect to: a) the precise measurement of the dependent variable; b) the sample; c) the addition of
controls; and d) the estimation technique.
The first set of (three) checks accounts for possible mismeasurement in our regressands. First,
we replace with unity, all observations where the ratio of foreign to total asset/liabilities exceeds one.
Second, we winsorize the series at the 1%- and 99%-levels. Finally, we drop all observations that lie
outside the (1%, 99%) range of our data. None of these checks alters our conclusions.

9

Our next set of (six) tests split the data set in different ways to see if our results are particularly
dependent on a certain set of observations. First, we drop all observations where the residual lies more
than 3 (2.5) standard errors from zero. We then successively drop early observations (from the first two
years of our sample), and late observations (the last two years). We also drop small banks (those whose
size, defined as total assets, lies below the 10th percentile), and large banks (those whose size lies above
the 90th percentile). Our results also seem insensitive to the exact sample. If the late observations are
removed, our liability results remain economically large but (unsurprisingly) become indistinguishable
from zero; dropping the large banks also renders the British asset results significant (although the
relevant sample of nationalizations also becomes small). Even taking into account these minor issues,
our results are essentially insensitive to reasonable changes in the exact sample.
Our third set of tests adds (four) controls to our regressions. In particular, we include: a) the
ratio of domestic retail to total liabilities, to control for differences in funding models across different
institutions; b) liquidity (measured as cash, market loans, bills, short-term paper and reverse repos); c)
size (measured as the natural log of total assets), and d) capitalization (measured as the ratio of capital,
defined as capital and other funds to total assets). 6 In a separate line, we also add a) profitability
(measured by operating profits as a ratio of total assets), as well as b) the return on assets; we do this
separately since these data are not available for all banks so that including them reduces the sample size
considerably. 7 Adding these controls reduces the size of the effects, but the coefficients on foreign
nationalization remain economically and statistically significant, in contrast to those on British
nationalization.
Our final set of (six) robustness checks varies the estimation technique. First, we weight our
observations by bank size; this reduces the asset estimates to insignificance but increases the precision
of our British liability effect to the point where it is statistically significant (if fragile). Next, we replace

10

our bank-specific fixed-effects with random effects; then we drop them altogether (a dubious exercise,
in our minds). For symmetry, we also drop time effects. Our default standard errors are robust and
clustered by bank; we provide conventional standard errors in another line. Our final check is to
estimate the equation with Tobit instead of least squares. 8
Generally, our results are resilient to a wide battery of sensitivity checks. In particular, we find
that the effect of foreign nationalization on the ratios of both foreign to total assets and foreign to total
liabilities is economically large (around fifteen percent), statistically significant, and similar. In the
presence of time effects, this second set of results can be interpreted as a reflection of banks’ demand
for deposits. The fact that nationalized banks, which are likely to be faced with an excess supply of
deposit as a result of their perceived safety, discriminate against foreign depositors is new and
additional evidence that government interventions have an impact on banking globalization. However,
we find no reliable evidence that nationalization of British banks has any substantial effect on these
ratios. Our findings are also consistent with prior studies that document that foreign banks reduce their
lending compared to domestic banks unless they are funded locally (Claessens and Van Horen, 2013;
Cull and Martinez Peria, 2013).

3. Examining the Breadth Effect for British Assets and Liabilities
Banks’ foreign assets are often spread across many countries. We have already established that
in the presence of large public interventions – such as bank nationalizations – the composition of a
bank’s balance sheet (both on the asset and liability side) tilts away from British to foreign activity, at
least for non-British banks. We now ask a related question: do portfolios of nationalized banks become
more alike? In particular, we ask whether a given bank’s cross-country portfolio mix converges (to
resemble the portfolio of other nationalized banks) or diverges in the wake of nationalization. This
11

would suggest the officials who take charge of nationalized banks make them divest in a similar fashion.
We interpret convergence as evidence of government interventions that limits the breadth of banking
globalization. 9 The fact that banks resident in the UK (both domestic and foreign) lend to an average of
53 countries makes the British banking system particularly suitable to test this hypothesis.
Similarity across Banks of Cross-Country Portfolios
The spread of foreign assets across countries differs by bank for a variety of different reasons,
often having to do with the particular regional or industrial expertise of the bank. For example, HSBC is
a UK-owned bank that has substantial operations in Asia, while Yorkshire Bank is a subsidiary of National
Australia Bank that specializes in UK mortgage lending, with little overseas activity. A bank’s crosscountry mix of foreign assets (hereafter a bank’s “cross-country portfolio mix”) also changes over time,
as circumstances, opportunities, and bank preferences change. We examine the similarity of the mixes
for a pair of banks at a point in time. In particular, we examine asset cosine similarity for a pair of banks,
measured as:
COSAi,j,t ≡ [Σk Assets(k)i,t∙Assets(k)j,t]/{[Σk(Assets(k)i,t)2].5}{[Σk(Assets(k)j,t)2].5}

(2)

where Assets(k)i,t denotes the assets that bank i holds in country k at time t, taken from the CC1 form
collected by the Bank of England. The cosine similarity of assets for a pair of banks i and j at time t is the
inner (dot) product of their assets across countries, normalized by their asset holdings. Cosine
similarities vary in principle between -1 (meaning exactly opposite) to +1 (meaning identical). Since all
our terms are positive, in our data set, they vary between 0 (unrelated cross-country portfolios) and 1
(identical cross-country portfolios).
Our data set contains foreign asset holdings for an individual bank in a given quarter for a large
number of foreign countries (indexed by k). The data are taken from lines 16-249 in CC1 form.
12

However, the vast majority of these countries are unimportant loan destinations, and our data set
registers a missing value if foreign assets, for a given bank in a given country, are less than half a million
British pounds. As a result, there are many missing observations, at times every other time-period, for
countries that only have a small presence in the foreign portfolio of the banks that we study.
Accordingly, we limit our scope to the 40 most important overseas destinations for foreign loans. 10 As
our default, we require that the pair of banks (i and j) share observations from a minimum of 30
countries (that is, at least 30 k’s from the 40 possible) in which they have foreign assets to compute the
cosine similarity; we check the sensitivity to this threshold below.
Cosine similarity of foreign assets for a randomly chosen pair of banks might not be expected to
change much upon nationalization of one of the banks, at least if the events which led to nationalization
were independent of the cross-country mix of exposures. However, if, say, losses associated with the
global financial crisis were concentrated in sub-prime mortgages issued only in the United States, then it
seems reasonable to expect banks to reduce asset exposure to the American market, so that cosine
similarities might increase. Of course, such behavior might be expected of all banks, not just
nationalized banks; we account for this feature by including a comprehensive set of time effects. Since
we also include comprehensive dyadic (bank-pair specific) fixed effects, our coefficient estimates will
only reflect idiosyncratic within-dyad time-series variation.
What if both banks in the pair are nationalized? (We have 354 such observations in our sample.)
The idea that government intervention may have an adverse impact on the breadth of banking
globalization leads us to two testable hypotheses. We expect the similarity of a pair of nationalized
banks’ cross-country portfolio mixes to diverge if the nationalized banks are from different countries,
but converge if they are from the same country. It is easiest to consider this with a simple example.
Suppose that the authorities from country x encourage divestment from countries a, b, and c and

13

investment in countries d, e, and f, while the authorities from country y have the opposite preferences,
since national interests differ. If authorities imposed their geographical lending preferences on
nationalized banks, then we would expect the cross-country portfolio mixes to diverge when banks from
countries x and y are nationalized; their cosine similarities should fall. But if both nationalized banks are
from the same country (we have 55 such observations), we would expect the opposite; their crosscountry portfolios should converge and cosine similarities rise.
Accordingly, we estimate the following regression model:
COSAi,j,t = αi,j + βt + γOneNati,j,t + ψBothNati,j,t + φSCBothNati,j,t + vi,j,t

(3)

where
•

COSAi,j,t is the cosine similarity of foreign assets (across countries) for a pair of banks i and j at
time t (a histogram can be found in Figure 1),

•

αi,j is a comprehensive set of dyadic bank pair-specific fixed effects;

•

βt is an analogous set of time fixed effects;

•

OneNati,j,t is a dummy variable which is one if either bank i or bank j (but not both) is
nationalized at or before time t;

•

BothNati,j,t is a dummy variable which is one if both bank i and bank j are nationalized at or
before time t;

•

SCBothNati,j,t is a dummy variable which is one if both bank i and bank j are nationalized at or
before time t and both banks are from the same country; and

•

vi,j,t represents the myriad of omitted factors determining the similarity of the cross-country
portfolio mix for a pair of banks.

The parameters of interest are ψ and φ. If both banks i and j are nationalized and the home countries of
i and j are engaged in different kinds of financial protectionism, one expects ψ to be negative, since the
14

cross-country portfolio mixes diverge upon banks nationalization. But if the banks are from the same
country, then financial protectionism would be manifest in convergence of the cosine similarity of the
assets, so we expect φ and (φ+ψ) to be positive.
Results
Estimates of (3) are tabulated in Table 3 below. Our default estimates are computed with least
squares and are provided in the top row.
The effect of a single bank's nationalization has little detectable effect on the similarity of banks’
assets (γ), as expected. However, if both banks are nationalized, then the similarity of banks’ crosscountry portfolio mixes falls by an economically and statistically large amount. Since the average value
of cosine similarity is .46 (with a standard deviation of .35), our estimate of ψ=-.22 means that cosine
similarity is approximately halved when both banks are nationalized, an economically large amount. The
estimate is also statistically significant, having a t-statistic exceeding 11. Perhaps more striking is the
fact that φ is estimated to be positive and even larger (in absolute value) at .31, again an amount that is
both economically and statistically significant. That is, the similarity of a pair of banks’ cross-country
portfolio mixes is significantly lower when both banks are nationalized, but this effect is more than
completely offset if the banks are from the same country (a p-value for the hypothesis of no combined
effect is tabulated at the right of the table). These results are consistent with the idea that the external
lending preferences of banks from the same country converge after nationalization. This is exactly what
one would expect if authorities impose their lending preferences on nationalized institutions, so we
view this as indirect support for the hypothesis that government intervention affects the international
breadth of banking globalization. This finding is also consistent with prior studies which document a
“flight-to-home” or “flight-to-core-markets” effect during the financial crisis by banks engaged in cross-

15

border lending (Giannetti and Laeven, 2012; De Haas and Van Horen, 2013; Ongena, Peydro and Van
Horen, 2013).
The remainder of the table contains sensitivity analysis, to show that our results are insensitive
to minor perturbations of our methodology. Our first set of (five) checks changes the dependent
variable. Our default measure of cosine similarity relies on having observations on assets for both banks
(i and j) for at least thirty countries (k) of the forty countries possible. We test the importance of this
threshold by varying it from 26 to 34 in successive rows. This has little effect on our results; φ is
positive, statistically significant, and larger than ψ in all cases; their sum is significantly positive in all
cases except the first (which is the least demanding in terms of observations).
We next substitute as a regressand the analogue to asset cosine similarity but using foreign
liabilities in place of assets:
COSLi,j,t ≡ [Σk Liab(k)i,t∙Liab(k)j,t]/{[Σk(Liab(k)i,t)2].5}{[Σk(Liab(k)j,t)2].5}

where Liab(k)i,t denotes the liabilities that bank i owes in country k at time t. The results here are similar
in economic direction and magnitude but lack statistical significance at any reasonable confidence level;
that is, this manifestation of financial protectionism is visible only in assets, not liabilities.
Our next set of (six) checks changes the estimation strategy. First, we weight observations by
the number of country-observations (k) that underlie the dependent variable. Since the regressand is
constrained to be positive but less than unity, we also estimate our equation with a censored (Tobit-like)
technique. We then show how our results change if we use conventional standard errors in place of
robust ones. We also replace our dyadic bank pair-specific fixed effects with random effects; then we
drop pair effects altogether. For symmetry, we also drop time effects. None of these perturbations
change the confidence levels much. The sum of ψ and φ becomes insignificant if we use either
conventional standard errors or a regression without dyadic effects. But in all cases, our estimates of
16

both ψ and φ are correctly signed, and both economically and statistically significant with φ>|ψ|; that
is, our results are insensitive to these various perturbations.
Third, we check the sensitivity of our estimates by varying the precise sample of observations.
Successively, we drop: a) early observations (defined as those from 2001 or earlier); b) observations with
small banks (defined as a pair where either or both banks have less than ₤2 billion in assets, where the
average bank size in our sample is ₤2.6 billion); and c) observations where the residual lies more than
2.5 standard deviations from 0. Essentially all our key results are robust; when we drop the early
observations in our sample (φ+ψ) remains positive but statistically insignificant.
Finally, we add some controls to the right-hand side of (3). Since we are interested in
understanding the similarity between the cross-country portfolios of a pair of banks, we examine (the
absolute value of) differences between the pair of banks in terms of fundamental bank characteristics.
Our first set of (five) controls includes: a) size (measured as the natural logarithm of total assets); b)
wholesale funding dependency (measured as the ratio of repos to total liabilities); c) the loan/deposit
ratio; d) liquidity (measured as the ratio of [cash + market loans + bills + short-term paper + reverse
repos] to total assets); and e) capital adequacy (measured as the ratio of capital to total assets). Adding
these controls has little effect on our results, which remain essentially unchanged. The final row adds a
further pair of controls; since these are only available for a limited number of observations, the sample
size is reduced considerably (from almost 59,000 to less than 26,000). The two extra controls are (as
always, measured as absolute values of banks’ differences): a) net interest (the ratio of net interest
income to total assets); and b) profitability (measured as the ratio of operating profits to total assets). 11
These controls, in conjunction with the reduced sample leave correctly signed and statistically significant
estimates of φ and ψ but the sum of these is now indistinguishable from zero, and the magnitudes are
reversed. All in all, we find these results reassuring.

17

We conclude from all this that our evidence on the similarity of cross-country portfolios before
and after bank nationalization constitutes evidence for the idea that government ownership may have
an adverse impact on the cross-country breadth of banking globalization. This evidence is only indirect.
Nevertheless, it is new, economically and statistically strong, and consistent with the idea that the
authorities impose nationalistic loan preferences on nationalized banks. More importantly, the
reduction in the breadth of financial globalization is likely to be associated with an increase in systemic
risk since banks have less diversified portfolios, a troubling consequence of bank nationalization. 12

4. Examining Persistence with the TARP
If government ownership is indeed behind the adverse impact on the breadth and depth of
banking globalization, then one might expect these effects to disappear once a bank is sold back to
private owners; at that point, profits replace politics as the overarching motive. Most of the banks
operating in the UK are still affected by large government interventions, so it is not possible to test the
persistence hypothesis with British data. But a number of banks that received TARP funds have already
repaid them and left the program.13 We therefore test the persistence hypothesis with American data;
taking advantage of bank-level data publicly available from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (and
used in numerous studies including Kashyap and Stein, 2000 and Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012). 14
The TARP was an American government program designed to purchase assets on banks’ balance
sheets in exchange for an equity or an equity-like stake in their operations. To participate in the TARP,
banks must have been deemed healthy by the regulators and agreed to restrictions on dividends and
executive compensation. One objective of this policy was to improve resilience and stability in the US
banking system. 15 The second objective of TARP was to “encourage US financial institutions to build
capital to increase the flow of financing to US business and consumers and support the US economy.” 16
Black and Hazelwood (2013) find that large banks, classified as those with in excess of $10 billion in
18

assets, originated relatively riskier loans when those banks entered TARP. However, they do not find an
impact on aggregate lending, which suggests that banks lent to riskier borrowers than they would have
in the absence of the TARP. In other words, without the TARP, lending by the affected banks would
have probably declined. This is consistent with Contessi and Francis (2011), who analyze aggregate
lending flows and show that commercial banks participating in the TARP increased lending compared to
other domestic commercial banks. 17
Taken together, the findings from the literature suggest that the TARP allowed participating
banks to build resilience, while simultaneously expanding loan supply. Bank capital ratios can be raised
through a) retained earnings, b) raising equity from outside investors or c) cutting back on (riskweighted assets). The first is a slow process, especially after a financial crisis; crises also tend to increase
the cost of raising equity. 18 Reducing assets is therefore typically the most immediate channel of
adjustment. Since some types of domestic lending expanded as a result of the TARP, other types of
lending might have shrunk. All this suggests that it is plausible to think that American banks contracted
foreign lending, perhaps as an unintended consequence of political pressure to rebuild their capitalasset ratios, while simultaneously maintaining or raising domestic lending (consistent with the intraportfolio risk-shifting found by Duchin and Sosyura, 2014). We search for this effect below. We also
exploit another noteworthy feature of the TARP, namely exit. If banks were subjected to political
pressure and as a result (whether unintended or not) cut back on foreign lending while in TARP, then
these effects should become weaker following exit from TARP. Thus, TARP seems like an ideal program
to test for the persistence effect of large government interventions on banking globalization.
We estimate the following model to examine the effects of TARP entry and exit:
ΔLi,t = αi + βt + γTARPEntryi,t + θTARPExiti,t + εi,t,
where:
•

ΔLi,t is the growth rate of lending;
19

(4)

•

αi is a comprehensive set of bank-specific fixed effects;

•

βt is an analogous set of time fixed effects;

•

TARPEntryi,t is a dummy variable that takes a value of one when bank i receives TARP funds at or
before time t and is zero otherwise;

•

TARPExiti,t is an analogous dummy variable that takes a value of one when bank i repays TARP
funds at or before time t and zero otherwise; 19

•

εi,t is a well-behaved disturbance term; and

•

γ and θ are the coefficients of interest.
Two dependent variables are of interest to us, the growth rates of domestic and foreign loans.

We create these from the consolidated financial statements of bank holding companies (FR Y-9C)
reports available from the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (defining foreign lending as
the difference between domestic and total lending); we also use form FR Y9-C for balance sheet control
variables. Our dataset is quarterly and starts in 1991Q1. Data on which banks received TARP funds, the
amounts they received, and when they repaid these funds, were obtained from the website of the US
Treasury. We use data at the level of the bank holding company; further details are available in the Data
Appendix. 20
One potential issue with testing for the impact of government intervention on global lending
flows with these data is the paucity of banks with substantial amounts of foreign lending. Few American
banks do any substantial foreign lending, so that the American analogue of the loan mix of (1) is heavily
skewed towards zero. The growth rates of domestic and foreign lending, on the other hand, are almost
normally distributed, which is why we choose these as our dependent variables, rather than the loan
mix. 21, 22

20

We estimate our default model for banks in the top 5% of the asset distribution. 23 Cetorelli and
Goldberg (2012) show that large global banks actively use their foreign subsidiaries to circumvent
liquidity shocks associated with US monetary policy. 24 We wish to examine banks whose foreign
operations are substantive, so that contracting them can make a difference to the bank’s ratio of capital
to risk-weighted assets; thus large banks seem to be the right set to examine. We conduct sensitivity
analysis to check for robustness.
The coefficients of interest to us are γ and θ. If entry into TARP led banks to expand domestic
lending at the expense of foreign lending, then we expect a positive (negative) sign on γ when domestic
(foreign) loan growth is the dependent variable. If the impact of TARP wears off after exit, we expect θ
to have similar magnitude but opposite sign.
Table 4 shows estimates of equation (4). The default estimates are provided in the top row.
The effect of TARP entry on domestic loan growth is small and not statistically different from zero. In
contrast, the effect on foreign lending growth is negative and significantly different from zero at the 5%
(but not the 1%) confidence level. The 4% foreign loan contraction associated with TARP entry is nontrivial but smaller than the asset mix results we document for the UK. The coefficients for TARP exit are
economically and statistically small for both domestic and foreign loan growth. The sum of entry and
exit coefficients is not statistically different from zero, both for domestic and foreign loan growth,
suggesting that the effects of TARP wear off upon exit. However, we do not wish to over-interpret this
result since almost all the estimates are economically and statistically small. Overall, they provide weak
but limited evidence in favor of our hypotheses, and no evidence inconsistent with our views.
The other rows of Table 4 show that our default results are robust to several perturbations of
the baseline methodology. Our first set of perturbations changes the sample. First, we restrict our
attention to even larger banks, defined as those in the top-1% in terms of total assets (instead of the
21

top-5%). This delivers somewhat stronger results in line with our priors; TARP entry reduces foreign
loan growth significantly, while TARP exit reduces domestic loan growth. Next, we switch tack and
include all banks in the sample. In that case, the negative coefficient measuring the effect of TARP on
foreign loan growth becomes smaller and insignificant, but the effect on domestic lending becomes
positive and statistically significant. This last finding is consistent with previous work that finds a
positive domestic loan supply of TARP, since those papers typically use all of the banks in the sample. In
both experiments, the effect of TARP entry is significantly higher for domestic than foreign loan growth.
Dropping observations from the big-6 banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan
Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) has little effect on our point estimates, but reduces our
precision such that nothing is statistically significant. Finally, we drop data from the 1990s and again
find consistent, albeit weaker, results.
Our default measure of domestic loan growth only includes lending to households, commercial
and industrial firms, since previous work by Garrica, Puddu and Waelchli (2013) found that TARP led to a
loan expansion to those sectors. When we expand our definition of domestic loans to include mortgage
loans to households, we still find robust results. 25 We then drop our fixed time-and bank-specific
effects. Our final robustness check is to drop all outliers, defined as observations where the residual lies
at least two standard deviations from zero. Throughout most of these perturbations, we find limited
effects of either TARP entry or exit, though TARP entry often has a significantly negative effect on
foreign loan growth, and the net effect of TARP entry and exit on both domestic and foreign loan growth
is typically zero. Still, these are weak results in the large; there are few clear indications that the TARP
had an economically or statistically significant effect one way or another.
Banks accessing TARP had to be in good standing with their respective regulators to receive
TARP support; however, a potential concern remains that banks that received TARP funds were banks

22

that took excessive risks prior to the financial crisis and therefore were weaker banks. One of these
potentially risky activities could have been exposure to cross-border lending. We address this concern in
two ways: 1) by controlling for bank quality, and hence cost of their debt in the bond market, using
banks’ credit default swap data and 2) by constructing a propensity-score matched and weighted sample
of banks that were not involved in foreign lending prior to the crisis as a control group. 26
Credit default swaps (CDS) have been used in the literature as a measure of default risk since
credit default spreads incorporate the likelihood of a firm’s default. For a subset of banks for which CDS
data are available, we observe that controlling for the CDS spread; we find weak results, though they are
consistent with our default findings. 27
Since not all banks have CDS contracts, we construct a propensity-score matched sample of
banks that look similar to banks that are engaged in foreign lending prior to TARP. We then use the
score from the propensity score estimate to construct a weight for the second stage regression. In
selecting observables, for the propensity-score regression we use variables that are likely to capture the
business model choices of a bank and estimate the following model:
For_Lenderi = α0 + α1Tier1i + α2NPLi + α3ROAi + α4Sizei + α5RWAi + α 6Trading Assetsi
+ α7Real Estatei + εi,,

(5)

where:
•

For_Lenderi is the dummy variable which takes the value of one if a banks has foreign lending
during the quarters of 2006Q1 to 2008Q2;

•

Tier1i is a regulatory capital ratio measured as a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;

•

NPLi is a ratio of non-performing loans to total loans;

•

ROAi is a measure of a bank’s profitability computed as a ratio of net income to total assets;
23

•

Sizei is a natural logarithm of total assets;

•

RWAi is a ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets;

•

Trading Assetsi is a share of bank’s trading assets in total assets;

•

Real Estatei is a share of bank’s real estate assets in total assets; and

•

εi is a well-behaved disturbance term.
The results from this analysis are shown at the bottom of Table 4. We show weighted results

both for our sample of large banks and for the entire sample of banks. Unfortunately, once again,
results are weak.
Finally, we construct a counterfactual scenario. We use the default regression results estimated
and tabulated in the top row of Table 4, as well as a counterfactual series constructed by setting γ and θ
to zero. We then aggregate the individual foreign lending time-series up to the total value for the US
banking system as a whole. Figure 2 presents our findings and shows that following the entry into TARP
in October 2008, aggregate lending to foreign borrowers decreases by 16.8% by December 2008. In the
absence of the TARP, however, this decrease would have been approximately 13.5%. Furthermore,
during the TARP, the differential between actual and counterfactual levels of aggregate lending to
foreign borrowers remains non-trivial, with an average difference of approximately 3% at the aggregate
level over the entire period. This persistence arises, since our regression model is estimated in growth
rates. As a result any effect in levels will be permanent. These findings show that, at the aggregate level,
the decrease in aggregate lending to foreign borrowers was reasonably large during the period of TARP
intervention.
Our findings suggest, but do not definitively show, that the TARP seemed to benefit domestic
lending at the expense of foreign lending. This is consistent with Contessi and Francis (2011), who show
that domestic aggregate lending by TARP recipients increased during the time they were in receipt of

24

TARP funds. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the aggregate impact on lending to
foreign borrowers. However, our results on persistence are weak, especially by way of contrast with our
strong depth and breadth evidence; none of our persistence effects are overwhelmingly significant in
either the statistical or economic senses.
In summary, we find that entry into TARP may plausibly have led to discrimination against
foreign lending, but TARP exit means that this effect also may have worn off. Since it is theoretically
plausible and there is empirical evidence that foreign loan discrimination may be exacerbated when
governments have an equity stake in the bank, these results suggest that any financial protectionism
may be transitory. However, our results regarding the impact of TARP, while pointing in the expected
direction, are insufficiently strong and only provide tentative support to this view.

5. Summary and Conclusion
Following the financial crisis of 2007-2009, the growth in global banking has slowed significantly,
and non-bank intermediation has risen to fill this gap. Is this the result of new frictions in the global
banking system? Rose and Wieladek (2014) suggest financial protectionism –political preferences for
greater domestic lending following bank nationalization, could lead to discrimination against foreign
lending. In this paper, we expand upon previous work by examining three dimensions of this effect:
depth, breadth and persistence.
We hypothesize that large government bank interventions can affect the depth of financial
globalization (external lending) in terms of both the asset and liability side of banks’ balance sheet. In
times of crisis, nationalized banks constitute the safest home for deposits; to the extent that these
banks are faced with an excess supply of deposits as a result, discrimination against foreign deposits is a

25

type of financial protectionism. We find strong evidence of this for foreign nationalized banks in the UK.
Similarly, if cross-country asset allocation, the breadth of banking globalization, is determined by
government preferences, banks’ foreign asset allocations to a particular country should converge
following nationalization. This is exactly what we find. Finally, if government ownership is an underlying
reason for the retrenchment in foreign lending, this effect should not persist once the government
ceases to own any part of the bank. We examine this hypothesis with American bank balance sheet
data around the dates that banks entered and exited the TARP. We find weak evidence supporting the
hypothesis and none opposing it.
Clearly, government ownership is not the only possible friction or reason why cross-border bank
lending has remained stagnant since the 2007-2009 crisis (Forbes, 2014). In this paper, we show that
government ownership could be an important friction inhibiting cross-border bank activity in both the
UK and the US. We found weak evidence that any discrimination towards foreign lending by American
banks wore off once TARP was exited, and nothing inconsistent with this claim. If the same mechanism
applies to other countries around the world, and if government intervention is indeed an important
friction, then global banking intermediation may rebound once again, when the current unconventional
intervention measures are unwound.

The April 2015 Global Financial Stability Report provides evidence of financial fragmentation and links it to tighter crossborder regulation, especially due to European bank retrenchment; see chapter 2 of the GFSR.

The BT form contains a full set of balance sheet data. The AL form gives a breakdown of lending by 18 different sectors. The
CC and CL forms provide data on external lending and liabilities, respectively. For more information and description of the
items reported on these forms, please see: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/Pages/reporters/defs/default.aspx .
Unfortunately our data are aggregated to the bank level; we cannot test e.g., whether there are differences between the
extensive and intensive margins of bank activity.
4

As a result of data restrictions, we can only capture foreign cross-border lending, but not lending by local foreign subsidiaries
abroad.

5

This interpretation is subject to the caveat that the Icelandic banks essentially defaulted on their UK-based deposits and were
also nationalized. For these banks, our interpretation does not apply. However, our results are robust to excluding the
Icelandic banks. The fact that they also hold for banks which received public capital injections suggests that our interpretation
is broadly correct.

6

Our definition of capital comes from the Bank of England’s BT form and corresponds to line BT19 (“Capital and other funds”).
Total assets, which are also equal to total liabilities, correspond to line BT20. Please see the Data Appendix for more detail.

7

These variables are taken from the Bank of England’s PL form. Data from this form are only available since 2004 onwards and
only cover the largest institutions, meaning the 75% of banks that make up 90% of total banking system assets.

8

We are forced to replace fixed effects with random effects.

9

As part of government support, banks were often asked to increase domestic lending. For example, French banks in receipt of
government support pledged to increase lending domestically by three to four percent, and the Dutch bank ING announced
that it would lend EUR25 billion to Dutch businesses and households as part of receiving government assistance (World Bank,
2009).

10

We exclude offshore financial centers: the Bahamas, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Gibraltar,
Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, and Luxembourg.
11

Outliers for liquidity, capitalization, interest income and profitability have been removed. For instance, we draw
observations where the liquidity ratio for a bank is above unity.
12

We thank Takeo Hoshi for pointing this out to us.

13

Details of the TARP are available from a variety of sources, including http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financialstability/TARP-Programs/Pages/default.aspx and http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/tarpinfo.htm

14

Quarterly consolidated financial statements for bank holding companies (FR Y-9C reports) are publicly available on the
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago website.

15

Li (2013) uses political and regulatory connections as an instrument and finds that banks participating in the TARP used twothirds of the capital injection to improve their balance sheets.

17

In the same vein, Duchin and Sosyura (2014) find that following the receipt of TARP funds, banks shifted asset allocation
within the same asset class to risker assets. Cornett, Li and Tehranian (2013) find that liquidity constraints prior to the receipt
of TARP funds prevented otherwise healthy banks from continuing to lend. Li (2013) finds that affected banks with below
median Tier 1 capital ratios raised loan supply by an annualized rate of 6.36%. Garrica, Puddu and Waelchli (2013) confirm this
finding with county-level data and show that banks receiving TARP originated approximately 12% more lending to small
businesses in the United States compared to banks that did not receive TARP funds. All of these findings suggest that
participation in the TARP did indeed have positive loan supply effects in the US, consistent with the second objective of the
program. Entry into the program was also associated with restrictions on executive pay and dividends payouts, in part to
ensure that bank capital was rebuilt from retained earnings. Bayazitova and Shivdasani (2012) and Wilson and Wu (2012) find
that banks with high levels of CEO pay were more likely to exit TARP early. Furthermore, Cadman, Carter and Lynch (2012) find
that firms that would have been relatively more affected by the associated pay restrictions were less likely to accept TARP.
Finally, Duchin and Sosyura (2012) find that strong political connections increased the probability that a bank would receive
TARP funds.
18

Financial markets might reasonably view a bank attempting to raise equity during a crisis as particularly vulnerable. This
asymmetric information means that the affected bank would only be able to raise equity at a large discount. As a result, the
cost of the signal that this would send might actually outweigh any benefit in terms of raising capital. Raising equity in a crisis
situation is therefore only a last resort option for most banks.
19

Since some banks repay TARP funds in installments, we use the quarter when the last TARP repayment was made to identify
exit from TARP.

20

Most bank holding companies are owned by American shareholders, so group level balance sheet data is easily available for
most American banks and is typically referred to as bank holding company level data, in contrast to the situation for the UK.
21

Since American banks are unlikely to lend abroad for real estate purposes, household, commercial and industrial lending is
likely to be the domestic equivalent of foreign lending.

22

For the US, foreign lending includes both cross-border lending and lending by foreign subsidiaries abroad.

23

We follow Kashyap and Stein (2000) and Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012), who define large banks as those in the top 5% of the
asset distribution.
24

Similarly, Black and Hazelwood (2013) also examine large banks only in their study of the impact of TARP on risk taking.

25

When we use our “loan mix” regressand, as in (1), we estimate a negative and statistically significant effect of TARP entry
(with a tiny effect of TARP exit). This suggests that banks which entered TARP cut back on domestic, rather than foreign,
lending, the opposite of what we would expect from financial protectionism. This may not be surprising, given that the
distribution of this variable is heavily skewed towards unity, since few US banks do significant lending abroad. It is exactly for
these reasons that we use the growth rate of foreign and domestic lending for US banks instead of the loan mix.
26

Following Li (2013) we also conducted instrumental variables analysis following the same approach and using his
instrumental variables. We are grateful to Li for providing us with his instrumental variables data for commercial banks.
However, unlike Li (2013) who studies commercial banks, banks in our sample are large bank holding companies involved in
cross-border lending for which these particular proxies for political connections appear to be less relevant and unfortunately
these instruments do not pass IV validity requirements.
27

For banks that issue bonds, however, controlling for their cost of bond issuance weakens our default results for foreign
lenders most likely due to sample size restrictions.
