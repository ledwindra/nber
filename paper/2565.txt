Introduction
Most

economists and policyiinkers believe that economic perforrce

differs across alternative exchange rate systems. Moreover, nany
economists

believe that

there are clear policy implications that can be

drawn from observations about past behavior under different exchange
rate systems and from economic theory.1

There is substantial evidence that the variability of real exchange
rates differs across alternative nominal exchange rate systems. A

(1983) studied monthly exchange rate and price series over a 23 year

period for a sample of 38 countries and used observations on countries

and time periods of floating exchange rates prior to 1973 and of

countries with pegged exchange rates after 1973 to try to isolate the
effects of the exchange rate system ner se from the effects of

The paper concluded tMt, although theperiod from 1973 through 1979
(the last year covered in the study) was characterized by greater

variance of disturbances to real exchange rates than the previous
period under Eretton Woods. the nominal exchange rate system itself was

increase in real exchange rate variability that was about 40 percent as
large as that experienced by countries that adopted floating rates, and

the difference was significant at the 1 percent level. This
relationship, of course, does not establish causality, but is
consistent with the view that pegged exchange rate systems lead to less
real exchange rate variability for any given set of underlying shocks.
Mussa (1986) examined this evidence further, adding some

and episodes that support this conclusion. In addition,

Mussa adopted the usual argument that the explanation for this
statistical relation is the sluggish adjustment of nominal goods

crisis and

"force" a devaluation. With some

intertemporal substitution, so that increases in expected future prices
tend to increase current prices, it turns out that the expectation that
policies to stem reserve losses will be followed also tends to

stabilize the real exchange rate. This sakes the response of the real
exchange rate to a given real disturbance snmller under a system of
pegged exchange rates than under a system of flexible exchange rates.

This

conclusion is obtained regardless of whether the underlying shocks

are changes in productivity or changes

in

tastes (or household

productivity).
Essentially, a disturbance that would raise the relative price of
foreign goods in terms of domestic goods by 10 percent wider a system
of floating rates has the same effect under a system of pegged exchange

4
rates, but also has an additional effect. Under floating rates, the
domestic currency would depreciate by about 10 percent. (This result
must be predicted by any reasonable model of exchange rates, because
empirically nominal and real exchange rates move together very

closely.) Under pegged exchange rates, however, the domestic central
bank will lose reserves (as it

acts

a residual buyer/seller to peg its

currency). The loss in reserves raises the probability of future
tariffs, quotas, and exchange and capital controls. This raises the
expected future (world) relative price of domestic goods.

Intertemporal substitution, whether operating through storage and
investment, substitution of labor effort, or direct substitution by
consumers of goods now rather than goods later, tends to raise the

current relative price of domestic goods. But this effect partly
offsets the direct effect of the disturbance, which was to raise the

relative price of the foreign good. As a consequence, the same
underlying disturbance has a smaller relative price effect under pegged
than under floating rates.

The argument is reasonably robust to alternative parameter values.
The key assumption is that changes in the level of reserves, i.e.
balance of payments deficits and surpluses, lead to changes in the
conditional probability of future trade and financial taxes and

controls. While there are parameter values for which, for example, a

As Karl

Brunner and Allan Meltzer (1986) say, in counenting on the

greater variability of real exchange rates under floating exchange rate
systems, "The findings raise a question about whether the

additional

6

is an excess burden, borne under fluctuating rates, a

response to policy differences in a fluctuating rate regime, or a
substitution of exchange rate variability for other effects of

underlying variability." This paper is an attempt to work out the
implications of what seems to be a clear and almost universal policy
difference under the two regimes, and to argue that this policy
difference can, without strong restrictions on parameters of the model,
in principal account for the observed difference in variability.

asset trades, interest payments, etc. (These taxes will be discussed

Instead, payments required by previously-held

assets are made at each AM. The budget constraint (2) describes the
representative domestic household's opportunities to buy or sell assets

at the date-O asset market. Then, at each PM, households buy and
consume goods. The constraints faced by the domestic households at
each Pit are the cash—in—advance constraints. With the usual assumption
that all transactions use the seller's currency, these cash—in—advance

In the absence of investment, the solution for allocations is discussed
in Stoclainn and Hernandez (1968). As discussed in the introduction,

investment is included in the model for purposes of intertemporal
substitution so that higher expected future prices raise prices
currently.

(36)

Stockman (1981) and Abel (1985) discuss effects of inflation on

capital accumulation in models related to the one in this paper. But
inflation will typically differ across alternative exchange rate
systems, and this difference could then cause differences in capital

accumulation and other features of the equilibrium. In order to focus
on other issues, I assume that under flexible exchange rates the
domestic money supply is chosen such that the domestic (production

price index) inflation rate t+1't+2 is deterministic, and (without
loss of generality) equal to unity. This corresponds to a type of
nominal interest rate rule.6

Although it can be assumed that both governments choose monetary
policies so as to keep p and q constant over time under flexible
exchange rates. it is not possible to make that assumption when the

exchange rate is pegged by monetary policy. Cenerally, pegging the
nominal exchange rate will turn out to require variations in either p

or q or both. But these price variations will have effects on capital
accumulation and other features of the equilibrium, including relative

prices. In order to emphasize the new points to be nade in this paper.
and not confound these points with effects of the exchange—rate system
that operate through effects of inflation on investment decisions. I

will make four assumptions. First, the one—period domestic and foreign

nominal interest rates are strictly positive in all states. As in
Lucas (1962). this amounts to a restriction on the stochastic processes

on exogenous variables. In contrast to Lucas's model, this assumption
does

imply a unit velocity of money in this model, for the reasons

explained in Stockrsan and Hernandez (1988). The purpose of this first
assumption is to guarantee feasibility of the following two

assumptions. Second, domestic monetary policy is chosen to keep p
constant. (This prevents effects on domestic investment of the kind
discussed

by Abel (1985).) Because the nominal interest rate is

strictly,positive,

rn(s) is identically zero. Consequently, increases

or decreases in Pt can be engineered by increases or decreases in M.
so it is feasible to vary the domestic money supply

guarantees

that the differences in foreign nominal price

rates, then, will be due to features of the model other than the

non—superneutrality of money. (One reason this is desirable is that.
for moderate levels of inflation, these non—superneutralities are

probably, of negligible ngnitude empirically. See, e.g.. Danthine.

output: an exogenous rise in domestic output raises the demend for

to prevent the large countercyclical swings in nominal prices that

below,

the gain argument in this paper rests on this positive

covariation of real and nominal exchange rates which, as noted above,

is clearly supported by the data. The point to be cede is that, while
the assumptions of fixed p and q are very special, the results of those

assumptions are much more general. As argued earlier in the paper, the
point of this paper is to present a theory explaining differences in
real exchange rate variability across nominal exchange rate systems
that does not rely on special assumptions that would neke it unlikely
to account for a wide variety of experiences.

A property of the model to be used below is the following. The
foreign money supply required to keep q constant does not depend on

realizations of 0. To see this, notice that equations (4). (5). (11).

Pened Exchange Rates

The model

is the same

as above, but there

are

two

modifications.

First, the government of the foreign country pegs its nominal exchange
rate to the currency of the home country (the "reserve—currency

country") by acting as a residual buyer or seller of its own currency

using a class of assets called "international reserves." These
reserves nay consist of interest—bearing assets, or foreign currency.

26

The division between assets owned by the central bank into
"international reserves" and "other assets" is largely arbitrary.
Because

no

the

foreign country's currency is pegged, the foreign country

longer conducts changes of its money supply to keep q fixed. In

fact, because the home
as

country

continues to choose its money supply so

to keep p fixed1 and because the nominal exchange

rate is pegged.

all variations in the real exchange rate occur through changes in q.
Second.

the government uses a variety of policies to prevent losses

in its reserves. In particular. when the foreign country loses
reserves, the probability distribution of future tariffs and future

denominated in foreign currencies.7 Edwards (1987) has recently
studied eighteen devaluations by Latin American countries and concludes
that "Typically, the authorities will try to stop this process [loss of

reserves] by imposing exchange controls, hiking tariffs, and imposing

quantitative controls." He shows that
in

the great najority of cases the devaluation was preceded by

an important piling up of exchange controls and trade
restrictions. In some episodes, such as Columbia in 1962 and

29
Although

the assumption in equation (52) seems to describe

accurately the behavior of governments under pegged exchange rates •
raises the question of why governments choose pegged as opposed to
floating exchange rates.

This paper

it

does not attempt to answer that

question. The explanation of why a particular exchange rate system is
chosen might be an important component of an explanation of the
different behavior of real exchange rates under alternative nominal

exchange rate systems. But there is not a priori reason to assume that
we must answer the question of why the system is chosen before we can

analyze the effects of the system, or as a part of that analysis. It
might be, for example, that pegged exchange rates are chosen as
discipline devices for monetary policy (which subsequent governments

attempt, often but not always successfully, to avoid). The different
behavior of nominal money and prices under pegged rates might have
different redistributive effects, so that a political equilibrium model

might be required to explain the choice. But these determinants of the

exchange

rate

system are not necessarily related in any important way

to the behavior of real exchange rates or economic aggregates that

result under that system.

Conclusions

An

equilibrium model of exchange rates has been developed to explain

the observation that real exchange rates vary less under pegged than
under floating nominal exchange
intended

rate

systems. The explanation is

to be robust to the specific assumptions made in

presentation

the

of the formal model. Aside from explanations that rely on

36

sluggish

nominal price adjustment — which have the problems mentioned

in the introduction — no (or few) alternative explanations have been
proposed.

There are several problems with the sluggish—price explanation of
the difference in real exchange rate variability across nominal

exchange rate systems. The nain problem is that, however important
sluggish nominal price behavior might be for explaining business
cycles, the timing and the observed dynamics in real exchange rates
appear inconsistent with most reasonable stories of sluggish price

adjustment. Studies of the real exchange rate show that it is very
close to a random walk, though there is some weak evidence of

mean—reversion (see. e.g. Huizinga. 1987).10

I want to imke three distinct arguments. First, the length of time
before the real exchange rate returns part way toward a mean is too
long, on a priori grounds, for plausible nominal price rigidity.
(Huizinga finds evidence of a mean—reversion only after about 3—6 years
in the recent floating—rate period, and in longer data samples

mean—reversion is slower still). It is difficult to see how menu costs
or other rationale for sluggish nominal prices could mice them adjust
so slowly.

Second, if nominal disurbances in the presence of nominal price
rigidities accounted for most of the variation in real exchange rates
under flexible rate systems, the exchange rate would eventually return
to

roughly its original starting point. If the nominal disturbance

had

no pernnnent real effects, the real exchange rate would return exactly

37

to its original position. But temporary real effects of nominal shocks
might have pernanent effects on the distribution of wealth. etc., so
that there could be perianent effects on the level of the real exchange

rate. Nevertheless, one would expect the return to be closer than

suggested in the evidence."
Third. the length of the average business cycle provides a guide as

to the duration of nominal price slugg:ness (on the assumption that
business cycles involve this sluggishness). The typical length of a
recession is an overestinate of the length of time that it takes

nominal prices to adjust most of the way back to equilibrium following
a disturbance. It is an overestimate because there are tinny reasons
(associated with adjustment costs in labor markets, inventories. etc.)
that changes in output and employment would tend to persist, once
started, even if the original disturbance to the economy has vanished.

Observations on the lengths of typical business cycles suggest that, if
nominal price rigidities were also responsible for most variations in
real exchange rates, we would see real exchange rates return most of
the way toward their means, following a shock, after a period of no

more than about

two years.

Of course, the assertion that real exchange rate variability

38

rigidities that are coimnon across countries nay play unjor roles in

business cycles without playing any najor role in fluctuations of real
or nominal exchange rates.

There are other explanations of the difference in real exchange rate
variability across regimes that do not (necessarily) involve sluggish

nominal price adjustments; some of these were discussed in Stocknn
(1983). Some arguments base the difference in real equilibria under
alternative nominal exchange rate systems on incomplete narkets.
Recent work with these implications includes }lseih (1984). Greenwood

and Williamson (1987) and Persson and Svensson (1987). In the absence
of complete narkets. the state—contingent pattern of monetary policy
can affect the real equilibrium.

Similarly, in models in which money is not superneutral, the
difference of inflation paths across alternative exchange rate systems
can affect the real equilibrium (as in Greenwood and Williamson. or

Aschauer and Greenwood, l982).12 The real equilibrium can also differ
across alternative exchange rate systems in the absence of Ricardian
equivalence, as in Helpmen and Razin (1987).13

While these models correctly analyze channels through which the
nominal exchange rate system can affect characteristics of equilibria.

no model along these lines has been developed to try to explain the

higher variance of real exchange rates under flexible

systenatically

exchange

based

systems. Explanations could probably be constructed

rate

on any of

explanations

these models, but it appears likely that the

would be

sensitive to special properties of the model or

39

parameter values. For example, the absence of uinrkets for certain
types of contingencies can clearly affect real equilibrium allocations,

but the effects on the variance of relative price changes would seem to
depend on the sources of disturbances, the state—contingent path of

monetary policy, and so on. It seems unlikely that arguments like
these could account for the wide range of evidence on real exchange

rate variability. The explanation presented in this paper, in
contrast, does not rely on any specific parameter values but on a
general property of government behavior under pegged exchange rate
systems, namely the propensity to implement policies that help prevent
reserve losses, arid the greater propensity to implement these policies

when their benefits —

are

in

terms of preventing a run on the currency —

greater.

The model in this paper assumed that tariffs and taxes on
acquisitions of foreign currency are imposed independently, under
flexible exchange rates, of the other exogenous disturbances that

effect the exchange rate. On the other hand, equation (52) implies
that these policies are correlated with exogenous disturbances under

pegged exchange rates. It is easy to generalize the model to allow g
to be correlated with e and

C under flexible

exchange rates.

Fornally, this results in some additional terms in equation (44). But
the conclusions of this paper are still obtained as long as higher g
(higher tariffs, and so on) tends to accompany domestic currency

appreciation. This is the likely pattern of covariance under flexible

exchange rates: countries with real and nominal appreciation

40

experience complaints from businesses about losses in international
"competitiveness."

and this raises the probability of tariffs and

similar measures. But, as long as the imposition of a tariff raises
the world terms of trade, an increase in the probability of a tariff
exacerbates the real appreciation, and raises the variability of real

exchange rates in the flexible rate system. As a result, the model
continues to predict lower variability of the real exchange rate under
the pegged rate system.

It is straightforward to apply the results of this paper to a mixed

intervene in exchange nnrkets and experience changes in the level of
international reserves, such systems resemble pegged exchange rates.
and should be associated with less variability in relative prices.
Realipunents

of exchange

rate bands alter the expected path of future

losses in reserves and, by so altering the probability of future
restrictive government policies, these realignments should be
accompanied by changes in real exchange rates.
The model discussed here has a number of subsidiary implications.
For example, the model implies that a disturbance to productivity has a
larger effect on investment under pegged exchange rates than under

flexible rates, While this implication is testable, it relies on the
particular way that intertemporal substitution was built into the

model. The model was developed with stationary productivity shocks and
government policies. As a result, it implies that the real exchange
rate is stationary. There is evidence that the real exchange rate is

Some other explanations based on the absence of Ricardian

equivalence face the problems that most reserves are held in interest
bearing form, and. in any case, are a snail fraction of private wealth.
Also, life—cycle models of non—Ricardian equivalence generate results
that are quite close to Ricardian models when reasonable parameter
values are used, as Poterba and Suniners, 1987, have shown. Finally,
the results of Backus and Kehoe (1987) could be applied to show that
absence of Ricardian equivalence is not sufficient for differences in
real equilibria across alternative exchange rate systems.

There have been few attempts to categorize systenatically the

differences in the behavior of vain economic aggregates under

alternative exchange rate systems. Baxter and Stocknn (1987) have
found little in the way of systenatic differences. However, their
results do not necessarily falsify the predictions of this model
regarding variables other than the real exchange rate, such as

investment. Indeed, it seems difficult to reconcile their results with
models based on sluggish nominal price adjustment, since most of those
models imply substantial differences in the behavior of aggregates
across alternative exchange rate systems.
