How Much Would You Pay to Resolve Long-Run Risk?

NBER Working Paper No. 19541

JEL No. E0,G0
ABSTRACT
Though risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution have been the subjects of careful
scrutiny when calibrating preferences, the long-run risks literature as well as the broader literature
using recursive utility to address asset pricing puzzles have ignored the full implications of their parameter
specifications. Recursive utility implies that the temporal resolution of risk matters and a quantitative
assessment of how much it matters should be part of the calibration process. This paper gives a sense
of the magnitudes of implied timing premia. Its objective is to inject temporal resolution of risk into
the discussion of the quantitative properties of long-run risks and related models.

Introduction

The long-run risks model of Bansal and Yaron (2004) has delivered a unified explanation
of several otherwise puzzling aspects of asset markets.1 Since Mehra and Prescott
(1985) posed the equity premium puzzle, it has been understood that the asset market
puzzles are quantitative and that an explanation must be consistent with observations
in other markets and also with introspection. Imposing such discipline led Mehra and
Prescott to exclude rationalization of the observed equity premium by levels of risk
aversion exceeding their well known upper bound of 10. This bound on risk aversion
has been largely respected since, including in long-run risk models (henceforth LRR).
However, we suggest in this paper that quantitative discipline has been lax in another
equally important aspect of the long-run risks model.
As a representative agent model, LRR has two key components - the endowment
process and preferences. The former is modeled as having a persistent predictable
component for consumption growth and its volatility; it will be described more precisely
below. The representative agent has Epstein-Zin preferences (Epstein and Zin, 1989;
Weil, 1990), which permit a partial disentangling of the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution (EIS) and the coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA). Denoting time t
consumption by ct , continuation utilities Ut satisfy the recursion

In his opening remarks, Bansal (2007) lists the following puzzles: the level of equity premium,
asset price volatility, the large cross-sectional differences in average returns across equity portfolios
such as value and growth portfolios, and in bond and foreign exchange markets, the violations of
the expectations hypothesis and the ensuing return predictability that is quantitatively difficult to
explain. He then writes: “What risks and investor concerns can provide a unified explanation for these
asset market facts? One potential explanation of all these anomalies is the long-run risks model.” For
elaboration and many additional references see Bansal (2007), Piazzesi and Schneider (2007), Hansen,
Heaton, and Li (2008), Colacito and Croce (2011) and Chen (2010).

consumption path is in the CES class with the elasticity of intertemporal substitution
EIS =

1
.
1−ρ

Epstein and Zin (1989) show that 1 − α is the measure of relative risk aversion for
timeless wealth gambles and also for suitable gambles in consumption where all risk is
resolved at a single instant, justifying thereby the identification
RRA = 1 − α.
The noted disentangling is possible because a decrease in α increases risk aversion without affecting the attitude towards consumption smoothing over time given certainty,
unlike in the standard additive power utility model where ρ = α. With these interpretations of ρ and α, parameter values in the LRR literature are specified with due
care paid to evidence about the elasticity of substitution and the degree of risk aversion. However, as is clear from the theoretical literature, ρ and α affect also another
aspect of preference in addition to the EIS and RRA. Clearly, judging the plausibility
of parameter values requires that one consider their full quantitative implications for
all dimensions of preference.
The above model of utility belongs to the recursive class developed by Kreps and
Porteus (1978) in order to model nonindfference to the way in which a given risk
resolves over time. For a simple example, suppose that consumption is fixed and
certain in periods 0 and 1, and that it will be constant thereafter either at a high level
or at a low level, depending on the outcome of the toss of an unbiased coin. Do you
care whether the coin is tossed at t = 1 or at t = 2? We emphasize that it is risk about
consumption, and not income, that is at issue, so that there is no apparent planning
advantage to having the coin tossed early. According to the standard additive power
utility model (ρ = α), the time of resolution of the given risk is a matter of indifference.
But not so more generally for recursive utility. For the specification (1)–(2), it is well
known that early resolution of a given risk (here tossing the coin at t = 1) is always

3

preferable if and only if
1 − α = RRA >

1
= 1 − ρ.
EIS

(3)

This condition is satisfied by the parameter values typically used in LRR models where
both EIS and RRA are typically taken to exceed 1. Moreover, there is clear intuition
that nonindifference to temporal resolution of risk might matter in matching asset
market data: because long-run risks are not resolved until much later, they are treated
differently, and penalized more heavily, than are current risks thus permitting a large
risk premium to emerge even when shocks to current consumption are small. This begs
the question whether the differential treatment required to match asset returns data is
plausible, which is obviously a quantitative question and calls for evidence about the
attitude towards temporal resolution.
We are not aware of any market-based or experimental evidence that might help
with a quantitative assessment. Therefore, we suggest a simple thought experiment
that through introspection may help to judge plausibility of the parameter values used
in the LRR literature. Thought experiments and introspection play a role also in
assessing risk aversion parameters (see, for example, Kandel and Stambaugh, 1990,
1991 and Rabin, 2000). In the latter context one considers questions of the form “how
much would you pay for the following hypothetical gamble?”. Here we ask instead
“what fraction of your consumption stream would you give up in order for all risk
to be resolved next month?” We call this fraction the timing premium and study its
dependence on the parameters of the model.
A picture that seems to emerge is that models that assume high persistence of the
consumption process (as in Bansal–Yaron, 2004) tend to imply a timing premium of
the order of 25–30%, much higher than in an i.i.d. model where it is of the order
of 7–10%. The intuition that persistence inflates the timing premium is corroborated
with the rare disaster model: assuming high persistence of the jump process (as in
Wachter, 2013) implies a timing premium of the order of 40%, much higher than in
the i.i.d. model of Barro (2009), where it is around 20%.
Section 2 presents our theoretical and numerical results for the LRR model. Section 3 offers an extended discussion of the results framed as answers to the following
4

series of questions: Why pay a premium for early resolution? Is introspection possible/useful? How is the premium for early resolution related to the welfare cost of
risk (Lucas, 1987)? What is the effect of modifying the endowment process to be
i.i.d., or to correspond to rare disasters (Barro, 2006,9) or persistent rare disasters
(Wachter, 2013)? What if a nonexpected utility model of risk preferences is adopted?
Section 4 concludes and includes a brief comparison with related papers by Ai (2007)
and D’Addona and Brevik (2011).

How much would you pay?

The LRR consumption process
Consider a consumption process of the following form:
log

ct+1
= m + xt + σt Wc,t+1
ct
xt+1 = axt + ϕσt Wx,t+1

(4)

2
σt+1
= σ 2 + ν(σt2 − σ 2 ) + σw Ww,t+1 ,

where 0 < a < 1 and Wc,t , Wx,t , and Ww,t are standard Gaussian innovations, mutually
independent and i.i.d. over time.
Here xt is a persistently varying predictable component of the drift in consumption
growth. Though ϕ should be thought of as much smaller than unity, small innovations
to xt are important because they affect not only consumption prospects in the short run
but also consumption for the indefinite future. The parameter a determines persistence
of the expected growth rate process.
The volatility of consumption growth, represented by σt , is time-varying with unconditional variance given by σ 2 . The empirical importance of stochastic volatility is
emphasized by Bansal et al (2012) and Beeler and Campbell (2012). Setting ν = 0 = σw
turns off stochastic volatility and leads to a process with a constant variance of consumption growth; Bansal and Yaron refer to this model as Case I and to the model
with stochastic volatility as Case II.
The LRR literature also distinguishes between consumption and dividends and

5

specifies a suitable process for the latter. But it is the consumption process as a whole,
and not its components, that is important here in trying to understand the nature of
preferences.
In LRR models, a consumption process similar to the above is the endowment of
a representative agent in a Lucas-style exchange economy. It is well known that there
is limited theoretical justification for the assumption of a representative agent; here
it requires that everyone have identical Epstein-Zin (hence homothetic) preferences.
Regardless, we treat the representative agent as a real individual when introspecting
about her preferences. The infinite horizon can be understood as arising from a bequest
motive, or as a rough approximation to a long but finitely-lived individual.
Definition of the timing premium
Here is the thought experiment. You are facing consumption described by (4) for
t = 0, 1, . . . In particular, the riskiness of consumption resolves only gradually over
time (ct and xt are realized only at time t). How much would you pay at time 0 to
have all risk resolved next period? More precisely, you are offered the option of having
all risk resolved at time 1. The cost is that you would have to relinquish the fraction
π of both current consumption and of the consumption that is subsequently realized
for every later period. What is the maximum value π ∗ for which you would be willing
to accept this offer? Call π ∗ the timing premium for the consumption process in (4).
Formally, let U0 be the utility of the consumption process in (4) with risk resolved
gradually, and let U0∗ be the utility of the alternative process where all risk is resolved
at time 1. Then2
π∗ = 1 −

U0
.
U0∗

Theoretical derivation for EIS= 1
The magnitude of EIS, particularly whether it is less than or greater than 1, is a source
of debate. Bansal and Yaron argue for an elasticity larger than 1 (in fact, EIS > 1 is
2

Utility admits an interpretation in terms of consumption perpetuities. For any consumption
process c, its utility as defined in (1)-(2) equals that level of consumption which if received in every
period and state would be indifferent to c. Thus π ∗ can be described as the fraction of the consumption
perpetuity that if relinquished would just offset the benefit of early resolution of risk.

important for the empirical performance of their model). Because closed-form solutions
are not available for EIS 6= 1, we compute values of the timing premium numerically
below. However, first we derive a closed-form expression for the timing premium under
the assumption of a unitary elasticity of substitution and restricting attention to the
case of constant volatility for consumption growth.

The premium is positive, that is, early resolution is preferred, if and only if α < 0,
consistent with (3). In that case, the premium is increasing in RRA, σ 2 , ϕ, β and a,
as one would expect. The first column of Table 1 gives a sense of the quantitative
meaning of this formula for the parameter values (other than EIS) specified in Bansal
and Yaron (2004) for a monthly frequency. (The risk premium described in the last
row is defined in Section 3.)

Numerical results
For values of EIS different than 1, we rely on numerical methods. To obtain the value
of U0 we note that the value function U in (1) can be written as U (c, x, σ) = cH(x, σ),
where H : R × R+ → R+ is a solution to the functional equation

Ex,σ is the expectation conditional on x and σ. We discretize x and σ, approximate H
by a Chebyshev polynomial, and approximate the expectation by a quadrature; thus
our approximation to (5) can be written as a system of nonlinear equations. We solve
this system using AMPL. To compute the value of early resolution U0∗ we run Matlab
Monte Carlo simulations with a fixed time horizon T = 2500 months (pasting U0 as
the continuation value at T ).

We limit RRA to be no greater than 10, the upper bound considered reasonable by Mehra and
Prescott (1985) despite the fact that in the literature many calibrated, as well as estimated (see Chen,
Favilukis, and Ludvigson, 2012), parameter values exceed 10. Those parameter values would inflate
the timing premium further.

Discussion and perspective

Why pay a premium?
Would you give up 25 or 30% of your lifetime consumption in order to have all risk
resolved next month? Keep in mind that it is risk about consumption that is at issue
rather than risk about income or security returns. Thus early resolution does not have
any apparent instrumental value. Kreps and Porteus (1978, 1979) suggest that an
instrumental value might arise because of an unmodeled underlying planning problem.
Essentially, there are more primitive preferences defined over deeper variables that
are the ultimate source of satisfaction; utility defined on consumption is an indirect
utility function, and early resolution has value for reasons familiar from Spence and
Zeckhauser (1972), for example. This sounds plausible in theory, but one needs a more
concrete story in order to believe that it could generate a sizable timing premium.4
At a psychic level, early resolution of risk may reduce anxiety. However, anxiety is
plausibly more important when risk must be endured for a long time. Therefore, the
risk premium required for bearing a lottery is greater the longer is the time that the
individual has to live with the anxiety of not knowing how the lottery will be resolved.
In other words, the willingness to bear a given risk declines as the date of resolution
approaches, a form of dynamic inconsistency. However, such dynamic inconsistency is
precluded when utility is recursive and thus anxiety cannot be a rationale for a timing
premium given the utility functions considered here. (This argument is due to Grant et
al, 2000; Caplin and Leahy, 2001; and Epstein, 2008.) To the extent that introspection
is based in part on considerations of anxiety, stated timing premia overstate premia
that are consistent with LRR.
For perspective, note that modeling nonindifference to the temporal resolution of
risk is the objective in the Kreps and Porteus papers. Such nonindifference is plausible
in theory as a property of ‘rational’ preferences. Further, Epstein and Zin (1989)
show that permitting a nonzero timing premium has the modeling benefit of allowing
a partial separation between EIS and RRA. Thus even if one is skeptical about the
4

Ergin and Sarver (2012) characterize behavior, in terms of choice between ‘lotteries over sets of
lotteries’, that indicates (or can be represented via) a hidden planning problem. It remains to see if
this work will help in assessing the magnitudes of timing premia.

10

descriptive importance of a nonzero timing premium, one might view its use as a cost
of separating EIS and RRA.5 How costly is a quantitative question. Similarly, it is
a quantitative issue whether nonindifference to timing makes sense as an important
component of an empirical model. But applied papers using Epstein-Zin utility have
accepted such nonindifference uncritically.
Is introspection possible? useful?
One might question whether introspection is possible or reliable given the artificial
nature of the question posed in the thought experiment: how much would you pay to
have your lifetime risk resolved next month, keeping in mind that you cannot use that
information. But starkness of the question arguably helps introspection. For example,
one might feel strongly, as we do, “why should I give up 25% ... just to know earlier,
when I can’t even use that information? ” In fact, it is arguably easier to introspect
than if one is allowed to use the information to reoptimize, in which case self assessment
of the timing premium would involve introspection about all of substitutability, risk
aversion and early resolution, as well as about all consumption processes in an expected
budget set.
Introspection is at best a matter of opinion and is inherently subjective. While we
are not arguing that a consensus is possible, we are hoping that our exercise may help
some people understand the LRR model more fully. The alternative is to leave the
modeling exercise completely undisciplined, which we find unsatisfactory.
How is the timing premium related to the welfare cost of risk?
Perspective on the timing premium is provided by examining also what the representative agent would be willing to pay to eliminate risk entirely. Lucas (1987) introduced
such a calculation into macroeconomics as a way to measure the welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations. His conclusion that consumption risk has very small welfare
costs stimulated many others to see how different model specifications might lead to
larger costs. Our interest here is less in the total cost of risk per se than in using the
latter to provide further perspective on the size of the timing premium. Specifically,
5

This has always been Epstein’s view.

11

are the timing premia reported in Table 1 large relative to the total welfare cost of
risk?
Consider the deterministic consumption process c = (ct ) where, for every t, ct+1 /ct
equals E0 (ct+1 /ct ), the unconditional mean of consumption growth that is implied by
the LRR process (4). The indicated mean is given by
log E0 (ct+1 /ct ) = m + at x0 +

Its utility at time 0 is U 0 . Whenever α < 1, risk is costly (U 0 > U0 ) and the cost may
be measured by the risk premium π, where6
π = 1 − U0 /U 0 .
The last row of Table 1 shows the welfare costs implied by the LRR model. For the
parameter values used by Bansal and Yaron, an individual giving up roughly 50% of
her deterministic consumption ct in every period would still be no worse off than with
the long-run risk process in (4).
It can be verified further that, as one would expect,
U 0 > U0∗ > U0 if α < 0.
This suggests the following decomposition:
U0
U0 U ∗
= ∗ · 0,
U0 U 0
U0
whereby the total cost of risk is decomposed into the cost of bearing risk that is
resolved ‘late’ (after time 1), and the cost of bearing risk all of which is resolved ‘early’
π
to measure the benefit of eliminating risk rather than π to measure its cost. The
Lucas uses 1−π
difference between the two measures parallels the difference between the compensating variation (used
here) and the equivalent variation (used by Lucas) of a policy change.

For the parameter values in Table 1, the indicated ratio is between .62 and .77. Thus,

What is the role of the endowment process?
The numbers presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 depend on the parameters of the
endowment process and in particular on the degree of persistence.7 To examine the
importance of persistence and to offer perspective on the improved fit of asset market
data provided by the LRR model, we compare its timing premia to those implied by
the benchmark i.i.d. model.8 An i.i.d. growth process for consumption is a workhorse
model, fits U.S. data well and is hard to distinguish statistically from the LRR process.
It is assumed, for example, in Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Calvet and Fisher (2007),
where dividends are separated from consumption, and in Barberis et al (2001).
Table 2 assumes β = .998, and that log (ct+1 /ct ) is i.i.d. N (m, σ 2 ), with m = .0015
and σ 2 = .00007. These latter values are roughly consistent with the annual mean
(1.8%) and standard deviation (2.9%) for real per-capita consumption growth used by
Bansal and Yaron (2004) to calibrate their model. Comparison with Table 1 shows
7

Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2012) use higher volatility persistence, ν = .999. Our algorithm failed
to find a solution to the value function. Hansen, Heaton, Lee, and Roussanov, (2007, Section 5.3)
study a continuous time model where volatility follows a Feller square root process; they find an upper
bound on volatility persistence beyond which the value function does not exist.
8
The next subsection examines yet another endowment process.

13

that timing premia here are considerably smaller than for the LRR model. It is also
interesting to note that small timing premia of the order of 1% are implied when the
EIS is much smaller than 1 (say equal to .2) even when combined with RRA= 10 at
the border of Mehra and Prescott’s admissible range. Because of this, and of (3) more
generally, timing premia caution against large values for EIS.9
Rare disasters
Another specification of the endowment process that is prominent in the asset pricing
literature is based on rare disasters. Barro (2009) also uses Epstein–Zin utility but he
assumes an i.i.d. consumption process where in every period there is a small probability
p of a negative shock that shrinks consumption by the factor bt .10 Specifically, the
consumption process has the following representation:
log

ct+1
= m + σWc,t+1 + log(1 − bt )Wd,t+1 ,
ct

where m is mean consumption growth, Wc,t+1 ∼ N (0, 1), Wd,t+1 ∼ Bernoulli(p), and
bt follows a categorical distribution of disaster sizes obtained from data.11 All those
random variables are mutually independent and i.i.d. over time.
Wachter introduces persistence into this model by assuming that the disaster probability varies over time. Specifically, she assumes that Wd,t+1 ∼ Bernoulli(pt ), where
pt = 1 − e−λt and λ follows the square root process
λt+1 = (1 − κ)λt + κλ̄ + σλ

p
λt t+1 ,

where λ̄ is the mean value of λ, κ measures persistence, and σλ measures the standard
deviation.12
9

There is little consensus about the values of EIS. Hall (1988) and Campbell (2003) argue for
values of EIS smaller than one. On the other hand, Bansal and Yaron show that EIS > 1 is necessary
for their model, including their specification of the endowment process, to deliver a positive relation
between the price to dividend ratio and expected consumption growth. However, the point being
made here is more general and is not tied to the LRR model.
10
He follows Barro (2006) and Rietz (1988).
11
See also Barro and Tao (2011) who fit power laws to the distribution of disaster sizes and Tsai
and Wachter (2013) who allow for rare booms as well as rare disasters.

Wachter’s model is in continuous time. We use a discretized version of her process.

The parameter values used by Barro (2009) are for an annual frequency: RRA = 4,
EIS = 2, p = .017, m = .025, σ = 0.02, and β = 0.951. The distribution of bt has
mean .29, minimum .15, maximum .73 and was obtained from the author. With these
parameter values (and T = 200 for the Monte Carlo simulation) the computed value
of the timing premium is 18% and the risk premium is 29%.13
We discretize the parameter values used by Wachter (2013): RRA = 3, EIS = 1,
λ̄ = 0.0355, κ = 0.08, σλ = 0.067, m = 0.0252, σ = 0.02, and β = 0.988. The
categorical distribution of bt has mean .22, minimum .1, maximum .68 and was obtained
from the author. With these parameter values (and T = 200 for the Monte Carlo
simulation) the computed value of the timing premium is 42% and the risk premium
is 65%.14 It is instructive to compare these premium values to those obtained in the
model without persistence: setting σλ = 0 and κ = 1 yields the timing premium of 22%
and the risk premium of 46%.15 Thus, allowing for long run shocks to the probability
of disasters heavily inflates both premia.
More general risk preferences
In (1)-(2) and in the Kreps-Porteus model more generally, risk preferences are in the
vNM class. Epstein and Zin (1989) describe a more general class of recursive utility
functions in which risk preferences that are consistent with the Allais paradox are also
permitted. Some of these specifications have been used to address the equity premium
and related puzzles (references are given below). Therefore, we explore briefly the
quantitative implications of such generalizations for timing premia.
To preserve simplicity while generalizing preferences, as well as for the convenience
of closed forms and for the clarity of intuition delivered thereby, we simplify the endowment process and assume that the (log) growth rate is i.i.d. with log (ct+1 /ct )
distributed as N (m, σ 2 ). Generalize (2) and consider utility defined by:
13

For comparison, we also computed the values for the monthly parametrization and they are close:
19% and 29% respectively.
14
As in the case of the Bansal–Yaron model, we compute the value of early resolution by Monte
Carlo simulations. To compute the value of gradual resolution we use value iteration.
15
The difference between these numbers and those that we obtain for Barro’s specification can be
accounted for by the different preference parameters and slightly different empirical distributions of
disaster sizes.

Here µ (·) is the certainty equivalent of random future utility using its conditional
distribution at time t.16 Assume that µ (x) = x for any deterministic random variable x,
that µ respects first-order and second-order stochastic dominance, and that µ is linearly
homogeneous (constant relative risk aversion).
It is convenient to use the renormalized certainty equivalent µ∗ , where for any
positive random variable X and associated distribution, µ∗ (log X) ≡ log µ (X). Then
(see the appendix) the timing premium is given in closed-form by π ∗ = 1 − exp (−β∆),

log E(Xt+1

one obtains the Epstein-Zin implied timing premium; denote the corresponding ∆ by
∆EZ .
As an alternative, consider the following disappointment aversion certainty equivalent:17 Fix 0 < γ ≤ 1, and for any positive random variable X (with distribution P ),
define µda (X) implicitly by

)

The interpretation is that outcomes of X that are disappointing because they fall
below the certainty equivalent are penalized relative to E log (X). If γ = 1, then
µ (X) = E log (X) and, when substituted into (6), one obtains the expected utility
model where RRA = EIS = 1.

Accordingly, nonindifference to timing arises herein

16

In general it depends on the information at t, but with the i.i.d. assumption such time dependence
can be safely suppressed.
17
The model is due to Gul (1991). For applications to finance, see Epstein and Zin (2001), Ang et
al (2005). Routledge and Zin (2010) present and apply a generalization, which is investigated further
empirically by Bonomo et al (2011). See also Epstein and Zin (1990) and Bekaert et al (1997).

only from the disappointment factor when γ < 1. Because the latter adds to risk
aversion, the effective degree of risk aversion is greater than 1. We compare this way
of increasing risk aversion to using Epstein-Zin utility with α < 0.
We show in the appendix that the difference ∆ in (7), written now ∆da , can be
expressed in the form

which expression involves the certainty equivalent of the single period gamble only.
Compare ∆EZ and ∆da to see the differing implications for timing premia of the expected utility versus disappointment aversion risk preferences. A meaningful comparison requires that the respective parameters α and γ be suitably related. For example,
suppose that the two certainty equivalents assign the same value to the distribution of
log (c1 /c0 ). Then substitute µ∗da (log(c1 /c0 )) = m + 12 α · σ 2 into (9) to deduce that

Roughly, disappointment aversion implies timing premia twice as large as those reported in Table 2 when γ is calibrated as described to α = −9, −4, −1.
An alternative calibration is to assume that the two certainty equivalents assign

the same value to the distribution of Σ∞

and hence to much larger timing premia under disappointment aversion. (For example,
the timing premium for γ that corresponds to α = −1 is about 23%.) Thus with either
calibration, timing premia are larger than with Epstein-Zin utility.
The appendix shows that (10) and (11) are valid for a broader class of risk preferences.

Concluding Remarks

Though risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution have been the
subjects of careful scrutiny when calibrating preferences, the long-run risks literature
and the broader literature using recursive utility to address asset pricing puzzles have
ignored the full implications of their parameter specifications. Recursive utility implies
that the temporal resolution of risk matters and a quantitative assessment of how
much it matters should be part of the calibration process. This paper is not intended
to provide an exhaustive or definitive assessment of parameters used in the literature.
Its objective is to give a sense of the magnitudes of implied timing premia and to inject
temporal resolution of risk into the discussion of the quantitative properties of LRR
and related models.
For other thought experiments that reflect on parameter values in the LRR model,
see D’Addona and Brevik (2011) and Ai (2007). D’Addona and Brevik assert that an
agent with Epstein-Zin utility achieves higher utility levels if he can commit to ignoring
information about the state variable xt appearing in (4). Though they describe their
results as concerning information, their analysis does not admit that interpretation:
instead of changing the information structure of the agent, they endow the agent with
a different consumption process that does not involve long-run risk (and has the appropriately adjusted unconditional variance). Thus, they de facto study aversion to autocorrelation of consumption instead of the (conceptually distinct) preference for ignoring
information or nonindifference to the temporal resolution of risk. In a continuous-time
economy with production, Ai (2007) considers the preference for early resolution from a
quantitative perspective by asking how much consumption the agent is willing to forgo
to learn perfectly the autocorrelated component of the production process instead of
having just a noisy signal of it. Our starker thought experiment where early resolution
means that all risk is fully resolved, and the discrete-time exchange economy setting,
arguably permit a sharper focus and make it easier for introspection to operate. (See
Section 3 for our related comments on whether introspection is useful.)
An important alternative to models based on recursive utility is the external habits
model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999). Corresponding scrutiny of that model seems
in order. Thus far plausibility of the habits formation process assumed for the repre18

sentative agent has been judged solely by how it helps to match asset market data.
The discipline urged by Mehra and Prescott (1985) suggests that at least one should
examine also whether it seems plausible based on introspection about the quantitative
effects of past consumption on current preferences. The difficulty of finding marketbased evidence concerning external habits, or about timing premia, does not justify
leaving them as ”free parameters.”

Because µda (Y 00 ) and µda (Y ) depend only on the distributions of Y 00 and Y , they must
be equal. Note that µ∗da satisfies: for all λ ≥ 0,

The preceding, and hence also equations (10) and (11), rely only on lognormality
and on the fact that µ∗da satisfies (12). Thus the comparative analysis of timing premia applies to any certainty equivalent function satisfying the latter properties. For
example, it applies also to the following generalization of (8):

where 0 < δ ≤ 1. Here outcomes are disappointing if they are smaller than the fraction
δ of the certainty equivalent. This generalization of disappointment aversion (which
corresponds to the special case δ = 1) is in the spirit of that provided by Routledge
and Zin (2010).18
