Identifying the Efficacy of Central Bank Interventions: The Australian Case
Jonathan Kearns and Roberto Rigobon
NBER Working Paper No. 9062
July 2002
JEL No. F30

ABSTRACT
The endogeneity of exchange rates and intervention has long plagued studies of the effectiveness
of central banks actions in foreign exchange markets. Researchers have either excluded contemporaneous
intervention, so that their explanators are predetermined, or obtained a small, and typically incorrectly
signed, coefficient on contemporaneous intervention. Failing to account for the endogeneity, when central
banks lean against the wind and trade strategically, will likely result in a large downward bias to the
coefficient on contemporaneous intervention -- explaining the negative coefficient frequently obtained.
We use an alternative identification assumption, a change in Reserve Bank of Australia
intervention policy, that allows us to estimate, using simulated GMM, a model that includes the
contemporaneous impact of intervention. There are three main results. Our point estimates suggest that
central bank intervention has a economically significant contemporaneous effect. A $US100m purchase
of the domestic currency will appreciate the exchange rate by 1.35 to 1.81 per cent. This estimate is
remarkably similar to the calibration conducted by Dominguez and Frankel (1993), who themselves noted
their estimate was larger than previous empirical findings. Secondly, the vast majority of the effect of an
intervention on the exchange rate is found to occur during the day in which it is conducted, with only a
smaller impact on subsequent days. Finally, we confirm findings that Australian central bank intervention
policy can be characterized by leaning aginst the wind.

Introduction

Since the introduction of floating exchange rates the use, and eﬃcacy, of intervention in the foreign exchange
market has been a controversial topic. Most central banks have at times engaged in frequent intervention, and at
other times followed a more laissez faire approach to the exchange rate.1 No doubt the observed disparate range
of policies between central banks, and within individual central banks over time, can in part be attributed to
the lack of accord on the eﬀectiveness and consequences of central bank intervention. Two key questions remain
unresolved: how eﬀective is foreign exchange intervention, and, if it is eﬀective, through which channel does it
act?
A critical barrier to answering these questions has been overcoming the endogeneity of changes in the exchange
rate and intervention. The central hypothesis is that intervention changes the exchange rate. But at the same
time, the decision to intervene is not independent of the movements in the exchange rate. Moreover, even once
a central bank has decided to intervene, the quantity of currency it buys or sells will typically depend on the
response of the exchange rate to its trades.
The literature has typically dealt with the simultaneous equations problem by assuming that the contemporaneous decision of the central bank is independent of the current innovations to the exchange rate. This is a
strong assumption. For example, it assumes that the central bank does not change its selling or buying behavior
by assessing the impact its actions have had on the exchange rate. On the other hand, there is strong evidence
in stock markets that big players indeed act strategically when they are unwinding large positions. Therefore,
why should we expect the same behavior is not optimal for a central bank?
In this paper we use an alternative identification method to solve the problem of simultaneous equations.
We use daily Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interventions data over the period 1986 to 1993, which contains
a dramatic change in intervention policy that we use for identification. We show that the estimates we obtain
have the correct sign and are significantly larger than those found with more standard methods. This is exactly
the direction we would have expected if endogenous variables is an important source of the bias. Further, the
vast majority of the eﬀect of an intervention on the exchange rate is found to occur during the day in which it
is conducted with a smaller impact on subsequent days. This explains why small eﬀects are usually found when
lag values are used in the typical OLS specifications. The major contribution of this paper is to provide some
evidence on the contemporaneous eﬀectiveness of intervention. Although, our methodology does not indicate the
channels through which intervention operates, it provides an improvement from previous estimates obtained in
the literature.
We concentrate our analysis on sterilized interventions, but we do not distinguish between secret and public
interventions. While undoubtedly this is an important distinction, most and in particular the largest, interventions are public. Certainly, future research should reconsider this issue. In this paper the focus of our attention is
the estimation problem. Indeed, we think that the simultaneous equations problem is the crucial aspect limiting
our understanding of how eﬀective policy is.
The identification assumption we use is based on the fact that the RBA (in 1991) decided to change their
policy regarding foreign exchange rate interventions. We interpret this shift in policy as exogenous, which is
1 Schwartz (2000) suggests that intervention is a dying practice despite the continued use of active intervention by the ECB and
Bank of Japan. However, the 18 central banks that responded to a survey reported in Neely (2001) believe it aﬀects the exchange
rate. Traders’ survey responses in Cheung and Wong (2000) indicate they also believe intervention has an eﬀect on exchange rates.

an important ingredient in our solution to the problem. Other countries have also changed “exogenously” their
policies, but typically central banks endogenously respond to the conditions in the market. Again, future research
should endogenize the policy decision and extend the present analysis to deal with more general framework.
However, as is argued in the text below it is the case that the Australian central bank decision to change their
method of intervention is unrelated to other macro events.
The paper proceeds as follows. There is a brief discussion, in Section II, of central bank intervention and the
associated literature. A description of the data and discussion of RBA intervention follow this, in Section III.
Section IV presents the estimation method used in this study. The results are presented in Section V, followed
by conclusions.

Review of the literature on Central bank intervention.

This section briefly reviews the literature on central bank intervention, focussing on the simultaneous relationship
between, and temporal behavior of, exchange rate returns and intervention. For more general and extensive
reviews see Sarno and Taylor (2001), Dominguez and Frankel (1993b) and Edison (1993).(Sarno and Taylor,
2001)(Edison, 1993)
Empirical studies, and statements by central banks, suggest that central banks intervene in foreign exchange
markets to slow or correct excessive trends in the exchange rate, i.e. they “lean against the wind”, and to calm
disorderly markets (for example Lewis (1995b) and Baillie and Osterberg (1997b)).2 The survey responses of
central banks in Neely (2001) suggest that these factors continue to drive the decision to intervene. A recent
study for Australia by Kim and Sheen (2000) has similar conclusions. Importantly, when central banks intervene
they trade in blocks throughout the day. As Neely (2001) reports, their subsequent trades are conditional on the
response of the exchange rate to their earlier trades.
Two main channels have been suggested through which sterilized intervention can aﬀect the level of the
exchange rate: the portfolio balance channel and the signalling channel. Intervention changes the exchange rate
through the portfolio balance channel if government bonds are imperfect substitutes, and so the change in the
reserve asset holdings of a central bank results in private investors revaluing their portfolios of domestic and
foreign assets.3 Since interventions are small relative to the stock of outstanding bonds most authors, including
Rogoﬀ (1984), have expressed skepticism that intervention could have a large impact through the portfolio
balance channel. Not surprisingly, many studies do not find evidence of this channel, and those that do, such as
Dominguez and Frankel (1993b), Evans and Lyons (2001) and Ghosh (1992), suggest that it is weak.4
Mussa (1981) suggested that if the central bank uses foreign exchange interventions to credibly indicate
intended changes in monetary policy, the resulting revaluing of the exchange rate can be described as the signaling
channel. The impact of intervention through the signaling channel has often been found to be substantially
stronger than through the portfolio balance channel (for example Dominguez and Frankel (1993b)). For the
signalling channel to be an ongoing transmission mechanism central banks should be seen to follow interventions
2 Other reasons occasionally cited by central banks include to target particular exchange rates, or to support other central banks.
We do not explicitly consider the impact of intervention on conditional exchange rate volatility, see Rogers and Siklos (2001) for
Australia or more generally Dominguez (1998) and Bonser-Neal and Tanner (1996).
3 The portfolio balance channel requires not only that bonds are imperfect substitutes, but also the failure of Ricardian equivalence.
4 Dominguez and Frankel (1993c) and Evans and Lyons (2001) both assess the portfolio balance channel for unsterilized intervention
and so provide upperbound estimates for the impact of sterilized intervention.

with appropriate changes in monetary policy. As a result intervention operating through the signaling channel
does not constitute an independent policy tool. Despite the evidence of a signaling channel, Fatum and Hutchison
(1999) are unable to find an explicit link between intervention and future monetary policy, while Lewis (1995b)
and Kaminsky and Lewis (1996) suggest it occasionally operates in the wrong direction.
Most central banks do not publicly announce their interventions.5 In light of the evidence for a signaling
channel many authors have questioned this policy.6 But interventions are not completely secret. Dominguez
and Frankel (1993b) find that most, and particularly the largest, interventions are reported. Central banks can
choose the method of intervention, ranging from direct trades with commercial banks, to indirect trades through
brokers, to control the degree of secrecy of their actions.
If intervention operates through the signaling channel then the exchange rate should react as soon as traders
digest the information contained within the intervention. Goodhart and Hesse (1993), Peiers (1997), Dominguez
(1999) and Chang and Taylor (1998) find that interventions that are intended to be visible are typically reported
by news services within 10 minutes to 2 hours, by which time it is often no longer ’news’ to traders. Any eﬀect
through the portfolio balance channel is also likely to be rapid as bond holders quickly respond to the change
in the relative supplies in the highly liquid market for government securities. Indeed, Neely (2001) reports that
the majority of central banks believe the full eﬀects of intervention are reflected in the exchange rate within a
matter of hours.
Despite the evidence of the rapid response of the exchange rate to intervention, studies using daily data
have often abstracted from the endogeneity of intervention and exchange rate determination by only including
lagged intervention (for example Baillie and Osterberg (1997a) and Lewis (1995b)). While intervention may still
have an eﬀect on the days subsequent to the initial trades, omitting the contemporaneous intervention prevents
measurement of the immediate impact and is likely to bias other coeﬃcient estimates. Other studies that include
contemporaneous intervention, such as Kaminsky and Lewis (1996) and Kim et al (2001), typically obtain an
incorrectly signed contemporaneous coeﬃcient, suggesting that purchases of the domestic currency cause it
to depreciate. Seemingly what they capture is the policy function coeﬃcient that represents central banks’
tendency to “lean against the wind”. The insignificant and incorrectly signed coeﬃcients in many previous
studies indicate that an accurate estimation of the impact of intervention on the exchange rate must incorporate
the contemporaneous eﬀect, and account for the endogeneity between these variables.

Reserve Bank of Australia Intervention Data

The estimation in this study uses daily interventions in the foreign exchange market by the RBA over the
period from July 1986 to November 1993. This period is chosen because it contains a single distinct change
in intervention policy, in October 1991, that allows us to identify the parameters in our exchange rate and
intervention system. Additionally, the characteristics of intervention in this sample facilitate accurate estimation.
Over the 7 years of data (1,930 daily observations) intervention is frequent (48 per cent of days) and often large
(up to $A1.3 billion). Another advantage of our sample is that other central banks do not intervene in the
USD/AUD market and so we need only focus on the actions of one central bank.
5 One

exception is the Swiss National Bank as noted by Fischer and Zurlinden (1999).
Bhattacharya and Weller (1997) and Vitale (1999) develop models of intervention that rationalize secrecy about
interventions.

The data are the daily net purchases of Australian dollars by the RBA and include all transactions made by
the RBA, including those on behalf of the Government. Since the RBA can, and does, meet the Government’s
demand for foreign currency transactions from its own reserves, it has discretion as to the timing of transactions
on behalf of the Government. For this reason the inability to exclude transactions on behalf of the Government
does not appear to be problematic. Similarly, Neely (1998) argues that not excluding client transactions for the
Fed has little influence. Over the sample used, almost all RBA intervention were conducted in the spot market
verses the US dollar (Andrew and Broadbent (1994)).7 Rankin (1998) reports that the RBA has always sterilized
its interventions.8
The exchange rate is measured as the US dollar value of an Australian dollar (USD/AUD). The intervention
and exchange rate returns data are aligned to cover exactly the same 24-hour period, commencing at 9am Sydney
time. This avoids inaccurate results from using misaligned data, which have potentially hampered previous
studies on central bank intervention. Aligning the intervention and exchange rate returns data is important
since central banks can, and do, intervene outside their business hours, as shown in Dominguez (1999), and
stated for the RBA by Rankin (1998).9 The 24-hour period over which the data are measured will be referred
to as a day. The intervention data for any given day will include transactions conducted in any of the major
markets around the world on that calendar day.10
Rankin (1998) outlines five distinct periods of intervention policy used by the RBA since the float of the
Australian dollar in December 1983. Table 1 summarizes the pattern of intervention over these five episodes.
The two periods used in this study are the second and third. During the period immediately following the float of
the Australian dollar, December 1983 to June 1986, the RBA allowed the dollar to float freely with only very small
interventions. Our study commences using data from July 1986 when the RBA took on a distinctly proactive
policy to foreign exchange market intervention. Interventions became more frequent (the RBA was active on
69 per cent of days) and substantially larger (the average absolute intervention was $A63 million). The change
in policy in our sample occurs in October 1991 when the RBA all but ceased to make very small interventions.
Large interventions continued to be used as in the preceding era as seen in Figure 1. As a result, the frequency
of interventions was drastically reduced (to 24 per cent of days), and the average size of interventions increased
substantially (to $A144 million). We do not consider the last two episodes when the RBA did not intervene from
December 1995 to June 1995, or when interventions resumed in July 1995.
[Insert Figure 1 here]
[Insert Table 1 here]
Table 2, drawn largely from Neely (2001), compares the frequency and size of RBA interventions with those
of the Fed, the Bundesbank, and the Swiss National Bank. Over the period covered in the table, from the early
1980s to the end of the 1990s, the RBA intervened on 42 per cent of days, compared to between 4 and 12.5 per
7 Over the past decade the RBA has moved to using a combination of spot maket transactions and currency swaps, which together
replicate a forward, to intervene and sterilize their intervention (see Rankin (1998)).
8 Dominguez and Frankel (1993b) and the references contained therein, suggest the Fed, Bundesbank and Bank of Japan have
typically only partially sterilized their interventions.
9 Given Australian trading hours do not overlap with either London or New York trading hours, and BIS (1993) shows one-quarter
of Australian dollar trading occurs in markets outside of Australian trading hours, this is potentially important.
10 For a few 24 hour periods that end on an Australian public holiday we do not have an observation in the Sydney 9am exchange
rate series. Instead the Australian dollar exchange rate measured at 12 EST (2am or 4am Sydney time, depending on daylight
saving) by the New York Fed is used.

cent for the other central banks. Typical central bank interventions are tiny relative to the huge daily turnover
in foreign exchange markets. The daily turnover in the USD/AUD market was estimated to be $US17.9 billion
in 1992 by BIS (1993), although only $US4.8 billion of this involved a non-financial counterparty .11 While the
Australian economy is substantially smaller than the US and German economies, and the Australian dollar less
heavily traded than all three other currencies in Table 2, the RBA interventions are of a comparable size to those
of the larger central banks.12 The large magnitude of some RBA interventions is also confirmed by comparing
the maximum interventions to the money base and M1 in Table 1. In the two episodes considered in this study,
the largest intervention is seen to be over 5 per cent of the money base, or 2 per cent of M1. Note that while the
turnover in the foreign exchange market has increased substantially, and certainly did so through our sample,
neither of the hypothesized transmission channels are aﬀected by the volume of turnover.

Identification of the eﬀectiveness of foreign exchange rate intervention

In this section we use a simple model of central bank intervention to highlight the limitations of the standard
methods and to show how we solve the identification problem.
The manner in which intervention aﬀects the exchange rate can be seen from a generalized uncovered interest
parity (UIP) relationship
(1)
et = E {et+1 |Ωt } + it − i∗t + ηt
where et is the exchange rate (value of domestic currency), η t represents possible predictable deviations from UIP,
and Ωt is the time t information set, which includes contemporaneous and past interventions, {IN Tj }−∞
j=t ⊂ Ωt .
Substituting forward this relationship, and suppressing other elements of the information set, the exchange rate
is

where et+T is the exchange rate at some distant point in the future. Under the portfolio balance channel, the
relative supplies of domestic and foreign bonds changes so that the risk premium on domestic assets, which is
part of ηt , changes. This is then seen to aﬀect the current exchange rate. The signalling channel suggests that
interventions are a commitment to future monetary policy and so represent a change in the expected future
interest rate, E {it+j |IN Tt }, so changing the current exchange rate. Under either channel the exchange rate is
a function of contemporaneous intervention, et = et (IN Tt ).
As noted earlier, central banks typically state that they intervene to slow or correct excessive trends in the
exchange rate and to calm disorderly markets. Indeed, the governor of the RBA states that the RBA has used

average (absolute) intervention for the regime including 1992 was just 0.6 per cent of the total average daily turnover.
BIS survey lists the USD/AUD currency pair as the 9th most traded. The average daily turnover for the USD/DEM,
USD/JPY and USD/CHF were $US192.2b, $US154.8b, and $US48.8b. Only considering trades with non-financial counterparties
the USD/AUD was the fifth most traded currency pair with the three pairs mentioned before respectively $US26.9b, $US32.3b,
$US7.0b.

intervention in “circumstances where market imperfections are resulting in overshooting” and that “intervention
can play a useful role in limiting extreme movements in the exchange rate” (Macfarlane (1998)). Since the
RBA sterilizes interventions, and is acknowledged to allow the Australian dollar to float quite freely, it seems
reasonable to assume that intervention is not used as a separate policy tool with independent goals. Rather,
intervention is focused on exchange rate outcomes. A simple representation of this policy, as used in Almekinders
and Eijﬃnger (1996), is that the central bank’s preferred level of intervention, or shadow intervention, IN T ∗ ,
would minimize squared deviations of the exchange rate from a moving target.
L = (et (INTt∗ ) − et )

Given the central bank is allowing the exchange rate to float, but doesn’t want it to move ’too quickly’, the

target is taken to be a moving average of past values of the exchange rate, et = n1 j=1 et−j . The optimal level
of intervention will then by given by

However, central banks do not intervene on every day, and very small interventions are extremely rare.
Presumably there are some costs to intervention, possibly because the strength of signals is reduced if they
are used too frequently. As a result the central bank only intervenes if the loss function would exceed some
benchmark, or equivalently if the shadow intervention exceeds a given threshold, otherwise remaining absent
from the market. Actual intervention can then be represented as

INTt = = |IN Tt∗ | > INT · IN Tt∗

where =() is the indicator function.
Equations (2), (5) and (6) constitute a system that determine the exchange rate and intervention.

4.1

Setup of the estimation system

We generalize the previous framework to include unobservable variables that aﬀect the exchange rate and the
central bank’s decision for intervention. The reason behind this extension is that we believe that there are factors
that are unobservable at daily frequencies that have impact on both variables, such as liquidity shocks, macro
shocks, etc. The model used is:
∆et
IN Tt
IN Tt∗

= αIN Tt + γzt + εt
¡
¢
= = |IN Tt∗ | > INT · INTt∗
= β∆et + zt + ηt

(7)
(8)
(9)

∆et is the observed exchange rate return at date t (a positive value is an appreciation), IN Tt is the observed
intervention (positive values are purchases of the domestic currency), and IN Tt∗ is a shadow intervention. The

6

estimation procedure includes constants and potentially lags, but this simple version is suﬃcient to demonstrate
the endogeneity problem.
Equation (7) is the reaction of the exchange rate to the central bank intervention. We assume that the
exchange rate is aﬀected by two types of shocks: εt which is a pure idiosyncratic shock to the exchange rate,
which we assume has no direct impact on the intervention decision, and a common shock (zt ) which is assumed
to move both the exchange rate and the central bank intervention decision. We explore the interpretation of
these shocks below.
Equation (8) is the decision of the central bank to intervene or not. We assume that this decision is made
entirely based on the shadow intervention. In other words, if the required intervention is large (larger in absolute
terms than some threshold IN T ) then the central bank participates in the market, otherwise, it remains absent.
Observe that implicitly we assume that if the shadow intervention is larger than the threshold then the central
bank intervenes, and its intervention is exactly the shadow one.
Equation (9) determines the shadow intervention. We assume that it is aﬀected by the movements in the
exchange rate, by the aggregate or common shock, and by some idiosyncratic shock reflecting innovations to
exchange rate policy. If the central bank aims to oﬀset changes in the exchange rate, i.e. lean against the wind,
then β will be negative. Equations (8) and (9) together constitute the central bank’s reaction function; where
the former reflects the decision to intervene, and the later one determines the quantity, or size of intervention.
The policy shock (η t ) is interpreted as innovations in the exchange rate target that are independent of the
nominal exchange rate shocks (εt ) and the common shock (zt ). The idea is to separate idiosyncratic shocks to
policy (such as trades on behalf of the government or unwinding of positions) and to the exchange rate (for
example, economic fundamentals) from those shocks that we might expect to aﬀect both variables (such as
herding, liquidity, or shocks to the exchange rate during periods of high conditional volatility). These common
shocks will aﬀect how intervention takes place, and the exchange rate at the same time. We assume that these
shocks are i.i.d., with mean zero and variances σ ε , σ η , and σ z . For simplicity in the exposition we have assumed
that all the variables have zero mean, but in the empirical implementation it is important to include constants.
Finally, the parameter of interest is α. If central bank intervention is eﬀective, then purchases of the domestic
currency will appreciate the currency and so α will be positive.
The intuition for this model is that the central bank leans against the wind, so β < 0, either to slow deviations
from trend, or to calm volatile markets. Small changes are tolerable and so the central bank does not bother
intervening. On the other hand, if exchange rate returns would otherwise be large, larger interventions would
be required to counteract these and will cause the central bank to enter the market. The shadow intervention
(IN Tt∗ ) summarizes the expected intervention if the central bank were to trade continuously in the foreign
exchange rate market.
This simple framework captures the two sources of simultaneity that exist in the data. The first one, is
the endogenous decision of participation. The second one, is the size of the intervention and the change in the
exchange rate once the decision of participation has been made. While the first source of bias has been widely
acknowledged in the literature, the second has received very little attention. This is understandable. Finding
instruments for the first one is hard, but some might be available. For the second one, this is much more diﬃcult.
In this model there does not exist an instrument that can be used to solve the problem of simultaneous
equations. More importantly, this bias is likely to be negative, pushing the estimate of α in equation (7)
downward, possibly even negative, explaining most of the results found in the data.
7

It is important to mention that there are several aspects of central bank intervention that have been oversimplified in this model. First, there is no distinction between public and secret interventions. As was mentioned
before, this has received considerable attention in the literature. In this paper we focus on the estimation problem. Second, we do not attempt to distinguish between sterilized and unsterilized interventions as the RBA
states that all of its interventions are sterilized.

4.2

Identification through changes in intervention policy.

The problem of identification is easily shown by counting the number of unknowns, and the number of series
we can measure, in the model. Under the assumption that we only observe the exchange rate, the size of the
intervention, and its timing, then, aside from the means, we can compute only five moments from the data: the
probability (or frequency) of intervention, the variance of the exchange rate when there is no intervention, and
the covariance matrix when an intervention has taken place. However, in the model there are seven unknown
coeﬃcients that explain the behavior of such variables: the parameters of interest (α, β, and γ), the threshold
of intervention (IN T ) and the three variances (σε , ση , and σz ).13
The standard procedures in the literature use the following assumptions. First, that there are good instruments for the participation decision. Second, that either β = 0 or α = 0 (exclusion restrictions). And third, that
the instrument is correlated with ηt but not with zt . This set of assumptions seems rather strong. Central banks
no doubt intervene based on their most recent information set, which includes the change in the exchange rate
during the day. Further, the fact that central banks know they have market power, which is the whole rationale
why they think it is worth intervening in the first place, collides with the assumption that β is zero. Central
banks should be, and indeed are, strategic in their interventions. The alternative identification assumption that
α = 0 is similarly problematic in that it implies that central bank interventions don’t have any eﬀect on the day
during which they are conducted. This contradicts significant circumstantial evidence.
The main contribution of this paper, is to relax these set of assumptions and use an alternative identification
method that can deal with some of the econometric issues at hand. Obviously, we depend on another set of
assumptions. We think those are weaker, in the sense that most of them are already imposed in the standard
literature. But this is certainly the first pass at the problem using these alternative methods and further research
should extend the present procedure. We discuss the caveats in detail at the end.
Our identification procedure is quite simple; in September 1991, the RBA changed its foreign exchange rate
intervention policy. Following the change, the RBA all but ceased to conduct small interventions but continued
to undertake larger interventions as before the change. In the model this would be summarized by a shift in
IN T . Eﬀectively, this means that there are two regimes. Under the assumption that the parameters and the
variance of the shocks remain the same across both regimes, we have only eight unknowns (one more than before
because we have two thresholds) but at least ten moments in the data.
Specifically, the basic model we estimate is the following:
13 The estimation of means adds the same number of equations and unknowns to the system, thus, the problem of underidentification
remains the same.

Note that in this setup we allow for constants in the mean equations and below we extend the model to also
include lags.14
We estimate this model with, and without, lags and present both results. When the model is estimated
without lags, there are eleven parameters of interest:
ª
©
ce , cINT , α, β, γ, π, IN Tl , IN Th , σε , σ η , σ z .

We compute the following moments in each of the regimes: the proportion of days with intervention; the mean
exchange rate return; the mean intervention; the variance of the exchange rate on days with no intervention;
and, the variance-covariance matrix on days with intervention. Furthermore, we compute the moments related
to the serial correlation of the exchange rate, as well as the probability of consecutive interventions. This gives
us a total of 20 moments, greater than the number of parameters, leaving our system over-identified.
We use simulated GMM to estimate the model. The general idea of this procedure can be easily understood
by analyzing how other techniques estimate the coeﬃcients. For example, when we use Maximum Likelihood
the goal is to estimate the parameters using the mean and the variances. GMM extends that procedure and
uses other moments. Simulated GMM is a further generalization, in which we choose diﬀerent moments and
characteristics from the data, and “create” our own data using our auxiliary model to match those “moments”.
Indeed, all three techniques use auxiliary models for their estimation. On the one hand, in ML we use multinomial
distributions, described only by means and variances. On the other hand, simulated GMM creates its own data
within a well specified model to produce the statistics that we are interested in matching from the population.
In summary, the procedure is as follows: First, we create random draws of 20,000 observations for three
uncorrelated shocks with unitary variance. The same set of shock variables are retained for the entire estimation
procedure. Second, we simulate the model given some initial conditions. Third, we compute the moments in the
simulated data and compare them with the sample moments. Finally, we iterate this procedure to search for the
coeﬃcients that minimize the distance between the population moments and the simulated ones.
To calculate the standard errors of the estimates we use the asymptotic distribution of the sample moments.
Using the data, we bootstrap the exchange rate, intervention, and probabilities of interventions to produce a
sequence of moments (100 of them). Then we estimate the coeﬃcients for each draw of the moments, computing
the distribution of our coeﬃcients. Because it is likely that the data is serially correlated, the bootstrap takes
this into account.

Results

Before we present our results, it is illustrating to demonstrate the problems in estimation that arise from using
more traditional methods. As noted earlier, frequently, researchers exclude the contemporaneous impact of
intervention in an attempt to overcome the endogeneity. To account for the properties of exchange rate data,
a GARCH error structure is typically used. Table 3 presents the results from an EGARCH(1,1) model of log
changes in the USD/AUD exchange rate over the full sample, and in each of the high and low bound regimes.
To highlight the impact of the simultaneity bias, we also present regressions that include the contemporaneous
intervention. The coeﬃcients on lagged intervention are uniformly small (around 0.005), and frequently the
wrong sign, suggesting that RBA purchases of Australian dollars depreciated the exchange rate.
[Insert Table 3 here]
The coeﬃcient on contemporaneous intervention is always significant and incorrectly signed. The estimates
are around -0.016 which in absolute value is much larger than the coeﬃcients from the lag intervention. The
wrong sign is a direct consequence of the endogeneity. The OLS estimate is a combination of α and β, and likely
γ, and can be negative even for positive α if the RBA leans against the wind (β < 0), or common shocks aﬀect
the two equations with diﬀerent signs (γ < 0).15

5.1

Contemporaneous eﬀects of Central Bank Intervention

We now move on to the results from our basic model (equation (10)) that excludes lags. This implies that the
central bank target is the previous day’s exchange rate, although the rich error structure will capture deviations
from this. Later we extend the model to include lags that implies a target of a longer moving average.
In Table 4 we report the coeﬃcients of interest: α, β, γ, the two thresholds, the constants and the variances.
The first column is the point estimate using the simulated GMM methodology and the moments from the data.
The second column is the mean of the bootstrapped distribution of the parameter. As mentioned before, we
generate 100 sets of moments bootstrapping the residuals of the original data in each of the regimes. The standard
deviation is of the boostrapped distribution of parameter estimates. The fourth column is the quasi t-statistic
calculated as the mean divided by the standard deviation. It is important to highlight that the distributions are
not normal, so this statistic should be considered informative, but not conclusive in terms of the significance of
the coeﬃcients. The fifth and sixth column are the maximum and minimum value of the boostrapped estimates.
The last column is the percentage of the observations that are below zero. This is the statistic that we use to
determine the significance of the coeﬃcients. We prefer to look at the mass above and below zero rather than
the quasi t-statistic given that most of the estimates are not normally distributed (this is a p-value).
[Insert Table 4 here]
Our main focus is on the estimate of α. The point estimate is 0.135, and the mean of the distribution is 0.136.
The standard deviation is 0.037. Indeed, as can be seen, from all 100 realizations the minimum is 0.033, which
15 If

there are no lags in the system the the OLS estimate when the exchange rate return is regressed on intervention will be

implies that there is no mass below zero. Both the quasi t-statistic and the proportion of realizations below zero
indicate that the estimate is highly significant. The distribution of α is shown in Figure 2.
[Insert Figure 2 here]
This estimate of α indicates that intervention has a large eﬀect on the exchange rate. The coeﬃcient on
contemporaneous intervention, α (0.136), implies that $A100m of purchases of Australian dollars is associated
(on average) with a 1.36 per cent appreciation of the Australian dollar. If we take the average exchange rate
over our sample period to be 0.75, then $US100m of purchases of Australian dollars would have appreciated the
Australian dollar by approximately 1.81 per cent. This response is larger than most results in the literature but
closely related to calibrations obtained by Dominguez and Frankel (1993c). Dominguez and Frankel calculated
that $US100m of purchases of US dollars would appreciate the US dollar by just under 1.6 per cent.
Our estimate diﬀers from that in Dominguez and Frankel (1993c) in that it is calculated directly from
exchange rate and intervention data. In constructing their estimate Dominguez and Frankel need to make
several assumptions, such as mean-variance preferences of investors, and use expectations survey data and assets
supplies data that are likely to contain measurement errors. The dependence on survey data also requires
that they consider exchange rate returns over a longer horizon and so can’t estimate the short-run impact of
intervention. A significant improvement of our estimation methodology is that we are able to include both
contemporaneous intervention and exchange rate returns to address the simultaneity. Nevertheless, our estimate
is close to the one found by Dominguez and Frankel (1993c), and we cannot reject the hypothesis that they are
diﬀerent.
The point estimate of β is -0.028, with mean of -0.089 and a relatively large standard deviation of 0.095.
As can be seen in Table 4 the quasi t-statistics suggest that the estimate is not statistically significant from
zero. However, demonstrating the importance of the non-normality of the distribution, all realizations are
below zero indicating the estimate is highly significant. Figure 3 depicts the distribution of β. As can be seen,
the distribution is not normal and there are some realizations that are relatively large (close to zero) but the
distribution has a long left tail.
[Insert Figure 3 here]
The negative coeﬃcient conforms with our priors, and RBA statements, that interventions are dictated by
leaning against the wind. The point estimate implies that a one percent unexpected depreciation of the exchange
rate leads the central bank to lean against the wind, buying 28 million Australian dollars in the foreign exchange
market to slow the depreciation.
Our estimate of γ is precisely estimated; it is negative and significant. The point estimate is -0.304, almost
identical to the mean of the bootstrapped distribution, -0.305, while the standard deviation is 0.056. In this case
100 percent of the bootstrapped estimates are negative, implying that the coeﬃcient is significantly diﬀerent from
zero at high levels of significance. The negative sign of γ demonstrates that shocks common to the exchange rate
process and the central bank’s reaction function simultaneously weaken (strengthen) the currency and increase
(decrease) the central bank’s desire to support the currency. Again this supports our priors of central bank
policy. These shocks can be interpreted to be shocks to the exchange rate during periods of high conditional
volatility which the central bank shows greater inclination to resist. The negative estimate of γ provides an

11

additional reason why failing to account for the simultaneity of exchange rate and intervention determination is
likely to bias downward the impact of intervention on the exchange rate.
Finally, the estimates of the thresholds are highly significant and reasonable given what we have observed.
These values have been scaled to simplify the estimation process. Their interpretation is that in the early period
the central bank participates in the foreign exchange rate market when the shadow intervention is larger than
$A3.2m, while in the later regime it intervenes if the required intervention is larger than $A18.5m.

5.2

Dynamic impact of Central Bank Intervention.

We now extend the model to allow for two lags in the structural equations. Doing so provides a richer representation of the policy function and allows us to examine the temporal impact of interventions on the exchange
rate.
The expanded model is:

where the additional coeﬃcients are the λ’s. There are 14 coeﬃcients to be estimated. We expand the moments
used in the estimation to include across time statistics: we include the probability of two and three consecutive interventions, and the first and second serial correlation in the exchange rate for both the high and low
thresholds.16 The results from the estimation are shown in Table 5.
[Insert Table 5 here]

The estimates of α, β have the same signs as those in the base model. The coeﬃcient α is smaller but the coeﬃcients on lagged interventions, λeINT,1 and λeINT,2 , are also positive, indicating that intervention continues to
aﬀect the exchange rate on the days subsequent to the intervention. Notably, these subsequent eﬀects are smaller.
The largest impact from an intervention occurs on the day it is conducted. The coeﬃcient β is again negative,
though larger in magnitude. The importance of accounting for the endogenous relationship is highlighted by
the much smaller role that exchange rate changes from previous days have in determining intervention, as seen
by the small coeﬃcients on lagged exchange rate returns. The coeﬃcients on lagged intervention are negative
16 We

have run the simulation also including other moments such as the probability of two positive interventions, and the correlation
in the quantities of two consecutive interventions. The results were not sensitive to these changes.

12

due to the tendency of subsequent interventions to be smaller than the initial intervention. The bootstrapped
distributions are depicted in Figures 6 and 7.
[Insert Figure 6 here]
[Insert Figure 7 here]

The interpretation of the response of the exchange rate to intervention is complicated by the feedback between
the variables in the presence of lags. Figure 4 shows the impulse response functions for the exchange rate in
the model with lags and the base model without lags. The impulse responses for the two models are calculated
ignoring the participation decision of the central bank. Since the coeﬃcients in the policy function on lagged
intervention are negative, abstracting from the participation decision implies the central bank will unwind its
intervention on subsequent days. Empirically this does not occur demonstrating the importance of the interaction
of the two components of the central bank policy function. The central bank almost never intervenes on opposite
sides of the market on subsequent days. A third series on the graph incorporates the entry decision by restricting
the central bank to remain absent from the market on the days following the initial intervention. Here the eﬀect
on subsequent days is shown to be larger, though still smaller than that on the initial day.
[Insert Figure 4 here]

The cumulative impact of intervention is shown in Figure 5. Note that the short lag structure used constrains
that intervention has a permanent eﬀect on the exchange rate. A long lag structure would be needed to capture
the unwinding of the eﬀects of intervention. Including many lags is not practical for the estimation method
we employ and so we are unable to assess how long the eﬀects of intervention last beyond a few days. The
cumulative response of the exchange rate to intervention, after 2 to 3 days, is similar for the models including
and excluding lags. In the model with lags $A100m ($US100m) will appreciate the exchange rate by 1 per cent
(1.35 per cent), slightly less than the 1.36 per cent (1.81 per cent) predicted by the model excluding lags.

Caveats and further research

Before concluding, it is worth spending time discussing the robustness and validity of the procedure developed in
this paper. Our estimation methodology has several caveats that should be addressed in future research. First,
it does not distinguish through which channel intervention aﬀects the exchange rate. Given the relative shifts
in bonds in private hands is small, the portfolio balance channel is likely to play an insignificant role. Rather,
the signalling channel, and possibly market microstructure eﬀects, would seem to be responsible - but this is a
conjecture, rather than a result.
Second, as it stands our methodology requires that the change in policy is truly exogenous. Finding such
exogenous changes in policy for other countries may not be straight forward. However, it is possible to model

13

the threshold in the participation equation as a function of macro variables, the exchange rate, and even the
second moments of the endogenous variables. The procedure of estimation would be exactly the same as the one
described here if the change in policy is thought as a shift in the coeﬃcients in that equation. Furthermore, the
participation decision could be rationalized as a switching Markov regime where the transition probabilities are
function of the endogenous variables. The estimation of these models is beyond the scope of the present paper,
and are left for future research. Nevertheless, it is important to mention that in this paper we have emphasized
the identification issue, and our specification is a reduced form representation of these models where the shift in
policy would be reflected in changes in the intervention decision equation.
Finally, our methodology assumes that the coeﬃcients are stable across regimes (other than the threshold).
This seems to be a reasonable assumption in the current study but may be more diﬃcult to justify in other
contexts. This criticism is akin to the application of the Lucas critique to models of monetary policy. Our
framework is not entirely exempt from this critique, and therefore, conclusions from this analysis are subject to
the caveat of the strength of these assumptions.

Conclusion

The endogeneity of exchange rates and intervention has long plagued studies of the eﬀectiveness of central
banks’ actions in foreign exchange markets. Researchers have either excluded contemporaneous intervention,
so that their explanators are predetermined, or obtained a small, and typically incorrectly signed, coeﬃcient
on contemporaneous intervention. Failing to account for the endogeneity, when central banks lean against the
wind and trade strategically, will likely result in a large downward bias to the coeﬃcient on contemporaneous
intervention — explaining the negative coeﬃcient frequently obtained.
This paper uses a novel identification assumption, a change in RBA intervention policy, that allows us
to estimate a model that includes the contemporaneous impact of intervention. We use simulated GMM to
estimate the model. There are three main results. Our point estimates suggest that central bank intervention
has a substantial eﬀect. We find that a (sterilized) purchase of $US100m of Australian dollars by the RBA would
be associated with an appreciation of between 1.35 and 1.81 per cent. These estimates are remarkably similar
to that in Dominguez and Frankel (1993c) even though our estimation methodology is completely diﬀerent,
depending on only exchange rate and intervention data. Second, an intervention is shown to have its largest
eﬀect on the exchange rate on the day in which it is conducted, with smaller eﬀects on subsequent days. This
finding has not previously been demonstrated in the literature due to the problem of endogeneity, and confirms
the beliefs of central banks of the immediacy of the eﬃcacy of intervention. Finally, we confirm findings that
Australian central bank intervention policy can be characterized by leaning aginst the wind.
