    "abstract": "\n\nIn contrast to earlier United States policies of open war, forcible removal, and relocation to address the \u201cIndian Problem,\u201d the Dawes Act of 1887 focused on assimilation and land severalty \u2014 making American Indians citizens of the United States with individually-titled plots of land rather than members of collective tribes with communal land. Considerable scholarship shows that the consequences of the policy differed substantially from its stated goals, and by the time of its repeal in 1934, American Indians had lost two-thirds of all native land held in 1887 (86 million acres)\u2014and nearly two-thirds of American Indians had become landless or unable to meet subsistence needs. Complementing rich qualitative history, this paper provides new quantitative evidence on the impact of the Dawes Act on mortality among American Indian children and adults. Using 1900 and 1910 U.S. population census data to study both household and tribe-level variation in allotment timing, we find that assimilation and allotment policy increased various measures of American Indian child and adult mortality from nearly 20% to as much as one third (implying a decline in life expectancy at birth of about 20%) \u2014 confirming contemporary critics\u2019 adamant concerns about the Dawes Act.\n\n",
