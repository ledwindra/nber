The Optimal Collection of Seigniorage:
Theory and Evidence

ABSTRACT

This paper presents and tests a positive theory of monetary and fiscal
policy. The government chooses the rates of taxation and inflation to
minimize the present value of the social cost of raising revenue given
exogenous expenditure and an intertemporal budget constraint. The theory
implies that nominal interest rates and inflation are random walks. It also
implies that nominal interest rates and inflation move together with tax
rates. United States data from 1952 to 1985 provide some support for the
theory.

Introduction

Throughout most of recent history, nominal interest rates, inflation, and

money growth have been highly persistent. They show little or no tendency to
revert to any normal level. Mankiw and Miron (1986) show that the three-month

nominal interest rate has been approximately a random walk since the founding
of the Federal Reserve System in 1914. Fama and Gibbons (1984) and Barsky
(1987) report findings of rion-stationarity I n the rate of inflation over the

post-war period. The purpose of this paper is to show that the optimal
collection of seigniorage over time implies that these series should be
approximately random walks.
Inflation is one form of taxation. It is a tax on holding money

balances. Beyond the traditional deadweight losses of a tax, inflation also
imposes many other social costs (Fischer and Modigliani, 1978). In a
first—best world, there would be no inflation, and perhaps deflation

(Friedman, 1969). Once distortions are introduced, including the need to
raise public revenue, a positive rate of inflation may be optimal (Phelps,
1973).

If the marginal social cost of raising revenue is increasing in the tax
rate, as one would typically expect, optimal fiscal policy entails the

smoothing of tax rates over time (Barro, 1979, 1986). Just as the smoothing
of consumption by consumers makes consumption a random walk (Hall, 1978), the

smoothing of tax rates by the government aakes tax rates a random walk. This
general principle applied to the case of seigniorage implies that nominal
interest rates and inflation should be smoothed as well, and that such
smoothing makes these series approximately random walks.

—2-

The model presented here to formalize these ideas is completely

classical. In particular, monetary policy is assumed to have no effect on
output or real interest rates. The model can be interpreted in two ways.
Those readers who view economic fluctuations through the lens of real business
cycle theory can consider the model as a description of both short-run and
long-run fluctuations in nominal variables. Yet there are surely many readers

who believe that monetary policy has real short-run effects because of
temporary misperceptions or nominal rigidities. These readers can interpret
the model as applying to the longer run in which the economy maintains output
and employment at the nat ural rate.
After presenting the model, I examine one key implication, that the

nominal interest rate and inflation are determined by the government revenue

requirement. Using data since 1952, I find that an increase in federal
government revenue of 1 percent of GNP raises the nominal interest rate by 1.1

to 1.4 percentage points. Although there is a highly significant positive
relation between the average tax rate and the nominal interest rate, the
theory explains only one third of the variation in changes in the nominal
interest rate.

The Theory of Optimal SeignioraQe
I examine here the optimal intertemporal monetary and fiscal policy of a

government that must satisfy a budget constraint in present value. The
government budget constraint requires

(1)

f

eG(t+s)ds

+

B(t)

-3-

where

G(t) =

real

expenditure at time t

T(t) =

real

revenue at time t,

B(t) =

real

government debt at time t,

p =

real

discount rate, assumed constant over time.

Expenditure is here taken to be exogenous, so as to highlight the issue of

revenue mix. Future expenditure is a random variable; the government thus
receives new information on its revenue requirement as time passes.

The government raises revenue from two sources. The first source of
revenue is a tax on output, such as an income tax or a sales tax. The second
source of revenue is seigniorage, the printing of new money. Both ways of

raising revenue cause deadweight social losses. The government chooses its
use of these two instruments to minimize the present value of these social
losses.

Denote the exogenous level of output as V(t) and the tax rate on output

as r(t). The revenue raised by this tax is thus r(t)Y(t). The deadweight
social losses induced by the tax are denoted f(T)Y, where V > 0 and f" >
The deadweight social losses are assumed homogeneous in output.
For the moment, suppose that the demand for money is described by the
quantity equation:

kY(t)

M(t)/P(t) =

Total revenue is therefore

T =

the sum of the receipts from direct taxation and seigniorage.
The social cost of inflation is denoted h(n)Y, where h' > 0 and h" > 0.

As with the cost of taxation, the cost of inflation is assumed homogeneous in

output. The nature of these inflation costs is discussed by Fischer and
Modigliani (1978). These social losses include direct costs, such as
increased menu costs. But they also include the losses associated with the
disruption of the efficient functioning of markets, as emphasized by Okun
(1975) and Carlton (1982).1

The goal of the government is to minimize the expected present value of
the social losses

where some time arguments are omitted to simplify the notation. The two

2

-5-.

As in much recent work studying dynamic optimization

(e.g., Hall, 1978;

Hansen and Singleton, 1982; Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers, 1985), I do not
solve for the decision rule but rather examine the first-order conditions

necessary for an optimum. The first-order conditions are

(7)

Et(f'(T(t+s)J} =

f[i(t)),

(8)

Et{h'[lr(t+s)]) =

h'[ir(t)],

=

(9)

kf'(r(t)].

The optimal fiscal and monetary policy satisfies these three equations.

The

intertemporal

taxation today and in the future. It expresses the "tax smoothing" of
optimal
fiscal policy inves tigated by Barro (1979, 1986). The intertemporal firstorder condition (8) equates the marginal social cost of inflation today and in

the future. The Static first-order condition (9) equates
contemporaneously
the marginal social cost of raising revenue through direct taxation and the
marginal social cos t of raising revenue through seigniorage.
Equation (7) i mplies that the marginal cost of

while equation (8) implies that the marginal cost of nfl atiori is a

martingale. If f(. ) and h(.) are quadratic, then the tax rate and the
inflation rate are themselves martingales. Since the real interest rate is
assumed constant, the nominal interest rate is a martingale as well
Equation (9), which relates the tax rate to the rate of inflat ion,

expresses a crucial implication of the theory. An increase in the
government
revenue requirement increases the use of both instruments.

Hence, the level

of taxation moves together with inflation and nominal interest rates.

-6-

The theory as developed so far assumes that real balances do not respond

to the level of inflation. More generally, one could make k a function of the
rate of inflation. This emendation of the model leads to slightly different
first-order conditions:

(7')

Et(f'[T(t+s)]) =

(8')

E(4s[7r(t+s)]) =

= f(T(t)],

(9')

where qI(IT) •

h'(n)/[k(,r)

+ (IT+p )k'(n)].

These first-order conditions have

roughly the same interpretation as in the basic model. Hence, introducing
feedback from inflation to real balances has little effect on the fundamental
theoretical implications.

There are at least two issues that the theory presented here does not

address. First, I have not explained the mechanics of how the monetary
authority achieves its target for inflation and the nominal interest rate.

It

is sometimes argued that such a target cannot be permanently maintained, or
that it would lead to indeterminacy of the price level. Recent work by Barro
(1987), Goodfriend ( 1987), and McCallum. (1986), however, shows how a nominal

interest

rate target can be achieved.

Second, I have not presented an explicit model of the transactions

process and the role of money. Faig (1986), Kimbrough (1986), and Lucas
(1986) suggest that explicit modeling of money as an intermediate good can
overturn the traditional conclusion that the inflation tax should be used in a

second-best world. Yet Romer (1985) presents a model of the transactions

—7-

process in which use of the inflation tax is appropriate. Moreover, as Barro
(1987) points out, the inflation tax may be the only way of taxing economic

activity in the underground economy. The precise circumstances under which
use of the inflation tax is second-best optimal remain an unsettled issue.

3.

Evidence

The theory of optimal seigniorage can be interpreted as prescriptive. As

such, the theory is common. For example, Tobin (1986, p. 11) writes,
The ability of the government to finance expenditures by issuing
money is the "seigniorage" associated with its sovereign monetary
monopoly. Both explicit and implicit taxes are distortionary. The
distortion of the inflation tax is the diversion of resources or
loss of utility associated with the scarcity of money, already
mentioned. But there are also distortions in explicit taxes;
lump-sum taxes are not available. The problem is to optimize the
choice of taxes, given the necessity of government expenditure.
This formulation correctly connects the money-supply process to the
government budget. (Emphasis added.)
This sort of theory is thus often recommended for the conduct of monetary
policy.

It is natural to ask whether the government (including the

monetary

authority) heeds these recommendations. In other words, can the theory of
optimal seigniorage be interpreted as at all descriptive? As I pointed out in
the introduction, the data confirm the implication of equation (8) that

inflation and nominal interest rates are highly persistent. This prediction,
however, is probably not unique to this theory and thus may not provide a
powerful test.

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the theory of optimal seigniorage
is that money growth, inflation, and nominal interest rates are determined by

-8-

the government revenue requirement. In this section, therefore, I examine
this prediction of the theory. If one could obtain reliable estimates of the
marginal social cost of inflation, the marginal social cost of direct
taxation, and the interest elasticity of money demand, then equation (9')

could be used to relate the level of taxation to the levels of inflation and

the nominal interest rate at any given point in time. Not knowing of such
reliable estimates, however, I undertake a more modest test of the theory.
estimate a linear approximation to equation (9') using United States time

series data. The goal is to test the implication of the theory that over time
higher tax rates are associated with higher inflation rates and higher nominal
interest rates.

In its purest form, as presented in Section II, the theory of optimal
seigniorage implies that the revenue requirement is the sole determinant of

inflation and nominal interest rates. That is, the static first—order
condition, equation (9'), holds without any error. In practice, of course,
the tax on real money balances depends on a variety of economic and political
forces, as does the tax on gasoline, cigarettes, or any other commodity.
Nonetheless, if the theory of optimal seignorage is useful as a positive
theory, increases in the government revenue requirement should tend to
increase the tax on real money balances.

The first nominal variable I examine is the nominal three-month Treasury

bill rate (INT). As a measure of the average tax rate, I use federal
government receipts as a percentage of GNP (TAX). Table 1 presents these
series annually between 1951 (the year of the Accord between the Federal
Reserve and the Treasury) and 1985 (the most recent year available).3

-9-

Table 1 shows an upward drift in both the interest rate and revenue over

this thirty-five year period. While these trends are consistent with theory,
they provide only weak evidence.

To abstract from this secular change, all

the regressions I report either include a time trend or are in

differenced

form.

3.1 Basic Results
The regression of the Treasury bill rate (INT) on the federal revenue
percent of GNP (TAX) and a time trend (TIME) for 1952 to 1985 yields (with
standard errors in parentheses):

INT = —26.1

The coefficient on TAX appears large. It implies that an increase in federal
revenue of one percent of GNP is associated with a 1.43 percentage point
increase in the nominal interest rate.4

The small Ourbin-Watson statistic prevents any valid inference from
regression (10) regarding statistical significance.

I present two remedies

for serial correlation. First, I quasi-difference the equation, applying the
filter (1-0.5L), which is indicated by the Durbin-Watson in regression (10).
The results after quasi-differencing are (standard errors again in
parentheses):

(11)

(1-0.SL)INT = —11.3

s.e.e. = 1.10

- 10—

The Durbin-Watson statistic no longer indicates statistically significant

serial correlation. The coefficient on TAX is only a little smaller. The
impact of federal revenue on the nominal interest rate appears positive,
substantial, and statistically significant.

As Granger and Newbold (1974) and Plosser and Schwert (1978) emphasize,
the problem of spurious regression can be severe when the variables in a

regression are random walks. In our case, the variables are approximately
random walks both in theory and in practice. To ensure that the relation
between INT and TAX is not spurious, I estimate the equation in d'ifferenced
form:6

(12)

LINT =

N = 34

1.13 TAX
(0.28)

=

0.31

D.W. =

1.82

s.e.c. =

1.22

The relation between INT and TAX remains significant. An increase in federal
revenue of one percent of GNP increases the nominal interest rate by 1.13

percentage points. Changes in the average tax rate explain 31 percent of
changes in the nominal interest rate.7

3.2 Subsample Stability
To investigate how robust is the relation between .the nominal interest

rate and the average tax rate, I split the sample evenly into two subsamples.
The second period, 1969-1985, is different from the first period, 1952-1968,

in many ways. In approximately 1969, the economy entered a period that is
widely noted for increased macroeconomic volatility, frequent supply shocks, a
slowdown of productivity, and the breakdown of many empirical macroeconomic
relationships.

—11—

The regression of INT on TAX estimated in differenced form with data from
1952 to 1968 yields:

(13)

MNT =

0.2

+

(0.1)

N = 17

0.72 ATAX
(0.20)

R2 =

0.43

D.W. =

s.e.e. =

0.59

The 1969 to 1985 subsample yields

(14)

AINT =

N = 17

1.52 TAX
(0.52)

2 = 0.32

D.W. = 1.96

s.e.c. = 1.62

In both subsamples, there is a significant positive relation between INT and
TAX.

While the sign of the relation is the same in both subsamples, the

coefficient estimate is very different. In particular, the coefficient is
twice as large in the second subsample. This increase in the coefficient may

be evidence against the linear specification. A log-linear specification
yields for the entire 1952 to 1985 sample:

(15)

log(INT) =

(16)

£log(INT) =

(0.06)

N = 17

2 = 0.52

For the 1969 to 1985 subsample:

3.7

(1.4)

D.W. =

2.01

s.e.e. = 0.22

With this log-linear specification, the coefficient falls from the first to

the second subsample. Hence, this functional form appears to overcompensate
for the non-linearity.

3.3 Alternative Hypotheses
The results presented so far indicate there is a significant positive
relation between the average tax rate and the nominal interest rate.

It is

possible that this correlation is proxying for some other ositted variable.
In this section I consider whether the addition of other variables changes the
apparent relation between INT and TAX.

One alternative hypothesis is that deficits tend to induce monetization.
Under this view, higher tax receipts should, holding constant expenditure,

lower money growth, inflation, and nominal interest rates. To test this view,
I include federal government expenditure as a fraction of GNP (EXP) in this

equation. This alternative view predicts that once EXP is included, the sign
on TAX should be negative. The theory of optimal seigniorage (equation
9)
implies that current expenditure should play no independent role and that its
inclusion should not affect the TAX coefficient.

Another alternative hypothesis is that interest rates and

receipts

passively respond to the business cycle. To examine whether the correlations
I find are merely business cycle phenomena without any additional structural
interpretation, I include the rate of unemployment (RU) as an additional
regressor.

—13—

When these two variables are included in the regression for the entire
sample (1952-1985), the results for the specification in levels are:

(18)

In all three specifications, neither the expenditure variable nor the

unemployment rate appears significant. Moreover, the relation between the
interest rate and the average tax rate remains positive and strong.

Another hypothesis that relates the tax rate to inflation and nominal
interest rates is "bracket creep:" to the extent that a progressive tax system

is not indexed, inflation tends to cause tax rates to rise. This hypothesis,

however, cannot easily explain the phenomenon reported here. Bracket creep
relates the tax rate to the price level, not to the inflation rate. A period
of positive but falling inflation would be associated with increases in tax

-14-

rates under the bracket creep hypothesis, but decreases in tax rates under the

theory of optimal seigniorage. Since the rate of inflation is positive
throughout the sample period, the bracket creep hypothesis predicts constantly

rising tax rates. In contrast, the theory of optimal seigniorage is
consistent with the disinflationary periods, such as from 1981 to 1983, in
which the tax rate fell with inflation and the nominal interest rate.

3.4 ReQressiOnS for Inflation
The theory presented here in principle applies to both inflation and

nominal interest rates. Nominal interest rates, however, have the advantage
of being measured accurately and with little conceptual ambiguity.

Moreover,

inflation depends on a variety of transitory forces that are beyond the
control of policymakers and outside the theory of optimal seigniorage.
Despite these reservations, I also examine whether a higher average tax rate
is associated with higher inflation.

The measure of inflation I use is the percentage change in the CPI (all

urban consumers) from December to December (INF). The regression of INF on
TAX yields:

(21)

INF =

—33.1 + 0.14 TIME + 1.80 TAX

(0.06)
(0.64)

N = 34

2 = 0.54

D.W. =

0.67

s.e.e. = 2.45

The estimates imply that a 1 percent increase in receipts as a fraction of GNP

raises inflation by 1.80 percentage points. This estimate is very close to
the 1.43 estimate from the nominal interest rate regression.

As before, I use two corrections for serial correlation. Quasi—
differencing yields:

(23)

The estimates here of 1.48 and 1.44 are very similar to the estimates of 1.25

and 1.13 obtained with nominal interest rates. The fit of these equations is
somewhat worse, as indicated by either the adjusted R2 or the standard errors

of estimate. This reduction in fit is to be expected, since inflation is a
"noisier" time series.

3.5 An Alternative Tax Measure
The regressions reported above relate the nominal interest rate and

inflation to federal government receipts as a percent of GNP. An alternative
tax measure is the average marginal tax rate on labor income (including social
security) as estimated by Barro and Sahasakul (1983).

I therefore now examine

whether this average marginal tax rate (MAR) also positively covaries with the
nominal interest rate and inflation.8

It is not clear a priori which of the two tax measures, TAX or MAR, is

preferable. One might argue that the average marginal tax rate is the best
measure of the marginal social cost of raising revenue. Vet consider what
makes these two variables different.9 Changes in the mix of taxes, such as a
shift between personal and corporate taxes, would change MAR without changing

-16—

TAX.

It is not Obvious whether such a change in the tax mix should be

associated with a change in the reliance on seigniorage as a source of

revenue. Resolving this issue requires a model more extensive than that
presented here.

The variable MAR is available up to 1983, so the sample here is two years

shorter. Regressing the change in the nominal interest rate on the change in
MAR yields:

(24)

AINT =

0.1

+ 0.50 MAR

(0.2)

N = 32

(0.16)

The relation between inflation and the average marginal tax rate iS:

(0.4)

N = 32

(0.30)

2 = 0.01

D.W. = 1.45

s.e.e. =

2.43

The average marginal tax rate is positively related to both the nominal
interest rate and inflation, but only the relation to the nominal interest
rate is statistically significant.

Conclusion

It is well-known that fiscal considerations are important for
understanding the money creation leading to many hyperinflatjons (Sargent,
1982; Dornbusch and Fischer, 1986).

I have suggested in this paper that

fiscal considerations may be important also for understanding less extreme

fluctuations in nominal variables. The theory of optimal seigniorage can

—17—

explain the non—stationary behavior of nominal interest rates and inflation.
The theory also explains the empirical
that nominal interest rates and inflat
ion positively covary with government
rece ipts as a percent of GNP.1°

The conservative economic ideology is usually thought to embrace smaller
gover nment, lower taxes, and less inflat ion, while the liberal ideology is
prone to larger government, higher taxes

policy

and more inflationist monetary

These combinations of monetary and fiscal policies

predicted by the theory of optimal seigniorage. Seen in this light, it is
perhaps less surprising that these combinations of policies also appear in
United States time series data.

There are a variety of avenues open for future research. One might relax
the assumption maintained here that the real interest rate is constant. This
extension would require specifying whether high inflation rates or high

nominal interest rates are socially costly. "Menu" costs point toward making
inflation costly, while the "shoeleather" costs associated with trips to the
bank point toward making positive nominal interest rates costly.
Future research could also use cross—national data to test the theory of

optimal seigniorage. The theory predicts that, ceteris paribus, economies
with high levels of expenditure and taxation also have high inflation and

nominal interest rates. Implementation of such a test, however, would likely
require taking into account the cross-national variation in the efficacy of
the system of taxation.

Finally, it would be useful to study in more detail the government's

choice of the mix of taxes in raising revenue. My empirical results suggest

-18-

that the revenue requirement can explain approximately one third of the
variation in the nominal interest rate.

One could probably do no better

explaining fluctuations in the gasoline tax or the cigarette tax. There are
clearly substantial fluctuations that the theory cannot explain. The theory
of optimal seigniorage as presented here is only a partial explanation for
fluctuations in money growth, inflation, and nominal interest rates.

It is sometimes argued that unanticipated inflation is non-distortionary

and thus equivalent to a lump-sum tax.

For simplicity, this formulation rules

out such non-distortionary inflation by including the same v

both the budget constraint and the socia1 cost function.

interest rates is due to expected inflati on.

While the post-197 2 period shows

some van ation in real rates, much of the var lation in nominal i
nterest rates
is still the inflation premium. See Fama and Gibbons 1984).

The theory has no prediction regarding the magnitude of this coefficient.

See equation (9).
5.

Since the Durbin—Watson statistic is about 1.0, applying this filter is a

non-iterated Cochrane-Orcutt serial correlation correction.

Iterating yields

a first-order autoregressive parameter of 0.52 with coefficient estimates
essentially unchanged.
6.

While differencing may be a good way of dealing with serial correlation

of the error, it also emphasizes higher frequency fluctuations.

To the extent

one expects a relationship to hold only in the long run, differencing may

obscure an empirical relationship. In the present application, this problem
does not appear serious. But it may explain why the coefficient falls
somewhat when the data are differenced.

I am grateful to Robert Barro for providing the updated series.

The correlation of TAX and tMAR is 0.70.

10. My empirical results are consistent with those of Evans (1987), who
examines 18 tax cuts and 27 tax hikes enacted since 1908. Evans finds (p. 49)
that interest rates fall in anticipation of tax cuts and rise in anticipation
of tax hikes.
