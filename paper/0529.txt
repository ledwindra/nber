The Historical Evolution of Female
Earnings Functions and Occupations

ABSTRACT
Of all the changes in the history of women's market work,
few have been more impressive than the rapid emergence and feminization of the clerical sector and the related decline in manufacturing employment for women. Although a century ago few women
were clerical workers, as early as 1920 22% of all employed nonfarm women were, and about 50% of all clerical workers were women,
Employment for women in the clerical sector expanded at five times
the annual rate in manufacturing from 1890 to 1930, and during the
same period of time wages for female clerical workers fell relative
to those in manufacturing. This paper explores the underlying
causes of these dramatic sectoral shifts by estimating the relationship between earnings and experience for manufacturing and clerical
workers from 1888 to 1940. It is seen that earnings profiles for
employment in manufacturing rose steeply with experience and peaked
early, while those in the clerical sector were much flatter and did
not peak within the relevant range. Returns to off-job training
and depreciation with age and with time away from the labor force
also differed between these occupations. A model of sectoral shift
is developed in which workers choose occupations and therefore the
time path of training on the basis of their life-cycle labor force
participation and their consumption value of education. The coefficients from the earnings function estimations are used to demonstrate
that the decline in the relative wage of clerical to manufacturing
work from 1890 to 1930 can be explained by such a model, Finally,
it is shown that a sizable percentage of the difference in the growth
of female employment in the manufacturing and clerical sectors can be
explained by various labor supply factors.

The structure of occupations for women has undergone episodic

changes throughout history. Despite frequent claims that the recent
transformation in women's work is an unheralded phenomenon, it is in
fact a small part of a more expansive historical evolution in the struc-

ture of occupations. Of all the changes witnessed in the history of this
labor market, few have been more impressive than the rapid emergence and
feminization of the clerical sector and the related decline in manufac-

turing employment for women. A century ago clerical sector employment
for women was practically non-existent, yet clerical work has been the
quintessential female occupation for most of the twentieth century. This

transformation was so rapid that even as early as 1920, 22% of all
employed non-farm women in the U.S. were clerical workers and about 50%

of all clerical workers were women. Change in the composition of the
female work force, from young and single to older and married women, was

less rapid. But this slow demographic evolution appears to have been
related to the more dramatic structural transformation of jobs. This
paper will explore the underlying causes of both the sectoral shift in
occupations and the related compositional change of the female labor
force.

Work in manufacturing and clerical employment offered two distinct

earnings-experience profiles. Most important among these differences was
the entrance requirement of some off-job training in the clerical sector.
Not surprisingly, wages were higher for clerical work than for that in
manufacturing, but for the families of most young women with limited job

attachment, manufacturing work was still preferable. Various changes
during the early twentieth century, most prominently the rise of high
school education, drew young women in large numbers from the manufacturing

2

to the clerical sector. The relative wage of clerical work to that in
manufacturing fell substantially during this period. The differential
growth in female employment in these two sectors was impressive; the average

annual increase in the clerical sector was almost five times that in manu-

facturing. Changes in the structure of the economy, primarily increases
in the service sector, served to buoy the demand for office workers. But
individual choice of occupations by young women and their families may have
accounted for a large fraction of the differential growth of employment in
the manufacturing and clerical sectors.

The model developed to explain these historical changes summarizes

an occupation by the vector of characteristics associated with its earnings-

experience profile. Occupations may differ by off-job and on-the-job
training and by the depreciation of skills with age and with time away from

the labor market. Individuals with differing life-cycle labor force participation may opt for different occupations, and many have viewed the segregation of occupations by sex as a product of such individual optimization

[Mincer and Polachek, 1974; Polachek, 1979; Zeliner, l975J.-' The properties
of earnings functions for contemporary women have been explained by the dura-

tion and intermittancy of their work experience. Their earnings rise slowly
with experience on-the-job and there is little depreciation of skills with age

and with time away from work. Particular occupations therefore have attracted
women who expect to exit and reenter the labor force at a later date, with
the result that women have generally become nurses and not doctors, typists

and not executives. But relatively flat earnings profiles, suggesting little
on-the-job training, have not always been the distinguishing feature of female

3

occupations. It was only with the emergence of the clerical sector early
in this century that women were able to choose an occupation with these

characteristics. The dominant work for women at that time, other than
domestic service, was that in manufacturing, and the features of its
earnings profile were wholly dissimilar to those we now view as customary
for women.

This paper has two purposes. The first is to demonstrate that
relatively flat earnings profiles have not always been the norm for women's
occupations and that the choice of occupations

by characteristics of the

earnings profile can be viewed as part of a long and continuous process in

American history. The second is to use estimates of the earnings profiles
to judge whether changes in relative wages in the two sectors from 1890 to

1930 could have resulted from particular
of these influences on the relative

supply side influences. The impact

growth of female employment in the two

sectors can then be assessed.

The first section describes the features of

female earnings profiles

estimated for various samples of manufacturing and clerical workers from
1888 to 1940.

It is highly fortunate that these surveys, which contain

data as rich as those in more

recent studies, have survived. Earnings pro-

files for employment in manufacturing in 1888 and in 1907 rose steeply with
experience and peaked early, while those in the clerical sector at a later

period were much flatter and did not peak within the
were, as well, other features of these profiles that

women a choice as to which characteristics

relevant range. There
differed, giving young

they valued more highly at given

wages. The second section discusses changes in the

occupational structure

of female employment and in the composition of the female labor force from

4

1890 to 1950. The timing of changes in both areas is stressed, in
particular
the fact that the rise of clerical
work for single women, beginning with the
large gains during 1900 to 1920, preceded the increase in clerical employment
for married women, which

expanded continuously from 1920. The third section

develops a model of sectoral shift in which

labor supply variables are stressed.

Workers choose occupations, and therefore off-job and on-job
training, on the
basis of the earnings profile of the occupation and their expected lifetime

labor force participation. It is shown that the decline in the relative
wage
rate of female clerical workers can be
rationalized within this context and
that a sizable percentage of the difference in the growth of female
employment in the manufacturing and clerical
sectors can be explained by various
labor supply factors.

1. Earnings Functions for Women, 1888 to 1940
During the two decades around the turn of this century most working

women were single, and those who were married and in the labor force were
generally not career women, but were instead working to overcome some unanticipated loss in income from a husband's illness
fraction of single women who worked when

or unemployment. A substantial

young expected therefore to leave the

labor force upon marriage and not to reenter it.
There were two major occupational

groups for women in the late

nineteenth century: factory work and domestic service. Employment for
young

women in manufacturing increased in importance during the late nineteenth
century, comprising 24.6% of all non-farm working women in 1870 but 31.8% in

1890. The major industries

employing women were textiles, clothing, food,

shoes, paper, and tobacco. More important than the nature of the industries

5

that employed them was the pervasive organization of work for women in manu-

facturing. About 47% of women across all industries worked on piece rates
in 1890, and it will be seen that this method of renumeration is critical in

understanding the structure of earnings with experience.' Occupations varied
greatly within the manufacturing sector, but characteristics were common to
virtually all positions in terms of the education and training required for
the job, and the dexterity and physical acumen demanded of the worker.
Various social concerns during the Progressive Era led to the
collection of data on the earnings, individual characteristics, and family

lives of working women. Data from two surveys, Working Women in Large Cities
(hereafter the 1888 Study) and Woman and Child Wage Earners (the 1907 Study)
have been used in this paper to estimate the determinants of earnings, particularly the relationship among earnings, experience on-the-job, and schooling.

The 1888 Study was highly comprehensive, including information on
earnings, job experience, and other personal and family characteristics for

1107 city-industry cells. Women of all marital states were included, with
single women comprising 88% of the total. The 1907 Study contains similar
information for single and married women separately across five industries.
This paper uses data from two industries, cotton textiles and men's clothing,
and the sample for single women consists of 2436 individual observations and
3/
that for married women of 937 observations.—

Earnings equations were estimated for both studies of the form implied
by a linearly declining investment ratio [Mincer, 1974],

are personal and family characteristics that influence the efficiency or

intensity of market work. It should be noted at the outset that the main
results of this paper are independent of this particular functional form,

and that a highly flexible form yielded essentially the same results. In
addition, although "synthetic cohort" forms are estimated, which might be
flatter than actual earnings functions, the conclusions from comparisons
across occupations are probably not affected.

The definitions of the

variables vary somewhat across the two samples and are given in Table 1.
The regression results are given in Table 2.

Earnings rose steeply with experience on-the-job and peaked early in

both samples. Most of the young women in the two samples entered work around
age 15, and their earnings peaked or plateaued about 15 years later, using

the total job experience measure for 1907. The earnings function for the
1888 Study peaks even earlier, because experience here is measured by years

at a particular job and not by total experience. When total experience (that
is, age minus age at which work began) is substituted, the earnings profile

is virtually identical to that estimated for 1907. By the time the earnings
function had plateaued or peaked, a large fraction of these young women had

married and had exited fromthelaborforce.
Education, which is given in the 1907 Study as months of school

attended, is converted here to a 9 month school year. It increased earnings

an average of 2% per year, with returns peaking at about 96 months of
schooling or at about 10 school years.V

These gains from education appear

to be attributable mainly to literacy, which by itself served to increase
earnings by about l4%..-"

Work in manufacturing therefore involved substan-

tial learning on-the-job, and there appears to have been relatively little
possibility for the substitution of off-job preparation.

the mean years of work experience for an individual would be higher than the
sample mean. A similar, but more complicated, problem exists in computing
the mean age at entering work.

9

Four major factors account for the shape of the manufacturing earnings

function: maturity, on-the-job training, and depreciation from aging and job

related factors. A small part of the steeply rising initial section is accounted for by maturity alone. Because the 1907 Study contains data on age,
years at school, and the age at which work began, maturity can be separated
from learning on-the-job by entering the age at which work began in addition

to job experience. Earnings would have risen at 2.2% per year, around the
age of entering the labor force, even without job training. Therefore, the
steeply rising segment which remains after accounting for relative maturity
is a function of job related factors alone.

Because almost one-half of women working in manufacturing in 1890
were paid by the piece, the rising portion of the earnings profile is not

merely a construct of a labor market with substantial hiring or firm specific
training costs. [See,for exaip1e, Salop and Salop 1976, for an elaboration

of the relationship between job screening and earnings functions.] This
portion of the profile is, instead, a function of the increased proficiency

of workers with more job experience. In some industries, increased proficiency implied job advancement; for example, in clothing manufacture young

women would advance from being basting pullers, to being sewers, to skilled
basters and button-hole sewers.

In other industries, increased profi-

ciency meant that the worker produced more and better output; for example
in weaving a more experienc& worker would tend more looms and produce fewer

defective pieces. But increases in proficiency during the early years of
work did not necessarily imply job advancement throughout working life
Although the earnings profile for young men in manufacturing in 1907 was less

steeply rising than that for young women, rather than plateauing early it
continued to rise.-'

Job learning for women in manufacturing may have been

substantial at first, but in most industries, proficiency and therefore
earnings were inevitably limited by the job itself.'

10

Therefore another important feature of the earnings profile forsingle women

was its early peaking and decline or possible plateauing.' Data for married
women from the 1907 Study indicate a similar but moderate decline in earning

capacity with age. (The 1907 data for married women do not give years of job
experience and therefore age was included instead.) Earnings were reduced by
about 1% per year from the late thirties to the early fifties and about 2% per
year from age 55 (Table 2, Part B).

Many of these women were sewers, working in

their homes and using skills that had depreciated less with time out of the labor

force than with

age.2-"

These data suggest that the finding for

single women of a peak in the earnings experience profile is not an artifact
either of the small sample size both at older ages and at higher experience

levels or of some selective sampling bias. Although some of the decline in
earnings may have been a product of aging alone, another part may have been
caused by physical depreciation from job related factors particularly for those
working in factories,!2!

Earnings functions for men working in the manufac-

turing and mining sectors at the same time period also peaked earlier than do
those for contemporary men, but these earnings profiles for men did not peak

as early as did those for turn-of-the-century women. Because of data limitations, it is difficult to compute the impact on earnings of intermittant labor

force participation for women in these samples. The fact that married and
widowed women earned 26% and 38% less, respectively, than did single women in
1888 suggests a decrease in earnings with time away from the labor force, but
age itself may have been the overriding factor in this regard.
In 1907 there were a half million female clerical workers, less than

a third the number of women employed in manufacturing. But by 1925 female
employment in the two sectors was about equal, and governmental agencies began

to divert some of their attention from the conditions of work in the factory

11

to various aspects of work in offices. Comprehensive surveys of female
clerical workers were taken by the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor,
the first in 1930 and another in 1940, which also included comparable data

for men. Various studies by states and by the National Industrial Conference
Board were also made during this period, but these were primarily surveys of

firms and not of individual workers. Summary reports of the two Women's
Bureau studies can be found in the bulletins of the Bureau, but the data con-

tained in these reports are highly aggregated. Although the original schedules
for the 1930 study appear to have been destroyed, I have located those for

the 1940 survey in the National Archives, D.C. The schedules for Philadel-

phia have been sampled,yielding 724 observations for females and 482 for

males)—'

These data contain detailed micro-level information on work his-

tories, education, personal characteristics, and earnings both in 1939 and at

the beginning of office work. These data have been used to estimate equation
(1), and the results are given in Table 3. Sample means and variable definitions are given in Table 1.

In contrast to the earnings function in manufacturing, that for female

clerical workers is considerably less peaked. It is flatter during the
early period of employment and increases throughout the relevant labor force

experience range, rising at about 3.4% on average per year. Data from the
earlier, 1930, Women's Bureau survey of clerical workers, for which only aggregate returns exist, exhibit similar relationships between earnings, experience,

and schooling._/ It will be assumed, therefore, for the empirical specification in Section 3 that the characteristics of the earnings profile for clerical
workers estimated with the 1940 data can be applied to a period somewhat
earlier.

12

The return to grade school education for clerical workers was about
equal to that in the manufacturing sample, but the returns to high school

education were greater.1 Furthermore, vocational school, business training, and college substantially increased earnings for clerical workers, and
a high school diploma, of course, was generally a prerequisite for such
education.

Unlike the manufacturing sample, the clerical survey allows a direct
computation of skill depreciation from years away from work due either to

"home time" or to being laid off the job. Each year of "home time" resulted
in a 1.8% decline in earnings, a figure of comparable magnitude to that estimated for contemporary profiles.--±/

The "home time" coefficient is slightly

less than the 2.2% decline due to furloughs, which is reasonable since being

laid off the job may signal lower job productivity. The inclusion of age as
a variable in the Table 3 regression does not result in a significant coeffi-

cient. Therefore, decreases in productivity in clerical work arose from gaps
in labor force participation and not from depreciation in job skills because
of aging.

In summary, the essential differences between the earnings function
for manufacturing work and for clerical work concern the returns to higher and

vocational education, the possibility of learning on-the-job, and the roles of

age and job related depreciation in affecting earnings. All of these factors
were important in the decisions of young women and their families regarding
schooling and occupational choice during the early part of this century.

I

will assume in the remainder of this paper that the choice of occupations is
coincident with the choice between the features of the two earnings profiles

and that young women and/or their parents made decisions by maximizing the
present discounted value of net earnings.

14

One can explain a large part of both the decline in the relative
wage rate of clerical to manufacturing work and the differential rate of
growth in employment in the two sectors over the period 1890 and 1930 by
considering changes in labor supply factors relating to the earnings profiles

of the two occupations. Employment of women in the clerical sector rose as
single women decided that they might remain in or reenter the labor force

after marriage. Employment in the clerical sector was also influenced by
changes in the valuation by parents of their daughters' time in school and

at home. Rising incomes led parents to purchase more schooling and leisure
for their children and to reduce the supply of young workers to manufacturing

jobs. A more precise model of the impact of such changes is developed and
applied in Section 3. A short history of female employment and wages in the
U.S. is presented in Section 2 to demonstrate that changes in employment between these two sectors is of critical importance in the evolution of the
labor market for women.

2. Employment of Women and Female Wages, 1890 to 1950
In 1890 only 11% of the non-farm female labor force was married but by

1950 this percentage had increased to 46%, Coincident with this change was
one in the occupational structure of female employment. The clerical sector
expanded dramatically from 1890 onward, while female employment in manufacturing
had a reduced rate of growth almost every decade from 1890 until 1950 (see

Table 4). Most importantly, the timing of changes in labor force participation
and occupational structure suggest the operation of labor supply factors. Because off-job training was generally a prerequisite for clerical work, its

impact on the labor force participation of married women had to have awaited

the spread of clerical employment among single women. The increase of married
women in clerical employment was, perhaps, the outcome of the continued employment, generally after marriage and child-rearing, of women who had been

clerical workers when single. Although the percentage of all clerical workers
who were married was lower than that for the non-farm national average for all
years from 1890 to 1950 (Table 4), the percentage married in the clerical

sector rose far more dramatically, particularly from 1920. The expansion of
employment for married women in the clerical sector is even more noteworthy
than these data reveal because the rapid growth of this sector in the early
period swelled the ranks of single women, as the decline in the percentage
married from 1890 to 1900 indicates.
Clerical work was the first numerically important occupation for women,
other than teaching, that required some educational commitment and gave, in
return, a higher wage and the promise of an earnings profile that made inter-

mittant labor force participation a feasible option. It was the first career
for women that had an extensive appeal, in the sense that the term "career"

indicates an occupation having a long-run planning horizon, There were various
aspects of clerical work that facilitated its rise, some of which are reflected

in the estimated earnings function of Section 1. The machinery of clerical
work became standardized in the early twentieth century and there was far less

specific human capital developed on the job than in the pre-typewriter age.-1
Employers no longer had to screen workers with respect to job attachment be-

cause training costs were now virtually separate from the job. Clerical work
was the beginning of both off-the-job training for women and the standardization of the female work force, and it served, therefore, to increase substitution possibilities among individuals and to raise substitution possibilities
in allocating work time over time for individual women.

17

During the same decades that clerical work expanded most rapidly,

relative wages for clerical workers fell substantially. Paul Douglas' [1930]
data indicate that the ratio of wages in clerical work to those in manufac-

turing (wc/wm) for men and women combined decreased from 2.21 for the
1890-99 period to 1.74 for l920-26)-1

Douglas' data do not distinguish

between male and female wage ratios, however various other sources show that

the ratio for women decreased more than did the average. One study, using
data from the manufacturing censuses of 1890 and 1930, gives a figure of

1.75 for the ratio (w/w) for women in 1890, decreasing to 1.27 by l930.--

Although these data are from merely two points in time, independent
evidence indicates that both the general trend and the magnitudes are correct,
and, in addition, that most of the decrease in the ratio occurred prior to

1920. For example, an extensive survey of bookkeepers, clerks, and steno-

graphers in Ohio from 1914 to 1929 indicates that the ratio (Wc/Wm) was
1.36 in 1914, declining to 1.28 by 1921, stabilizing there for most of the

1920's. Considering only clerical workers in offices gives a ratio of 1.60

declining to 1.33 for the same time period.1

Because the clerical wages

in the Ohio study are only for bookkeepers, clerks, and stenographers, the
overall trend should be more extreme, because typists, who were paid less
than average, increased in importance over this period.
Douglas [1930, pp. 366-69] speculated that falling relative wage rates
for clerical workers resulted from any one or a combination, of the following

three factors. Clerical work could have required less education over time
as the nature of the job changed. Secondly, clerical workers in the early
twentieth century could have been receiving large quasi-rents which decreased

with the expansion of business and commercial vocational schools. Lastly,
Douglas noted that his data may have reflected only compositional changes;

18

as women became a greater proportion of all clerical workers, the average

wage would fall because women's wages were lower than were men's. But because further analysis has shown that wages for women in clerical work
declined relative to those for women in manufacturing, this third factor

does not appear to be of importance. Douglas' first hypothesis is also
thrown into question by the fact that wages in clerical work continued to
decline relative to those in manufacturing well past the initial period of

replacing the nineteenth century male clerk. There may be some substance
to Douglas' second point, about the existence of quasi-rents, although the
analysis in Section 3 indicates that a large fraction of the difference in
wages can be explained more conventionally.
The remainder of this paper will demonstrate that the difference in
wages between female workers in the clerical and manufacturing sectors in
1890 can be explained by the differences in schooling requirements for the
two occupations and by, perhaps, a self-selection into clerical work of
women who desired to reenter the -labor force after marriage. Rising real

incomes led to an increase in education and in leisure for daughters This
higher valuation of the time of teenaged girls may have served to decrease
the wedge between the initial wage rate in clerical work and that in manu-

facturing. Reinforcing this effect was the fact that clerical work had far
less depreciation with age and little with respect to "home time," and was
preferred as the labor force planning horizon of many women became longer.
These effects may in turn have been reinforced by other changes such as

decreases in the birth rate, the expansion of compulsory education, and
increased amenities of office work.

19

3. A Model to Explain the Evolution of Female Occupations
Over the four decades 1890 to 1930 the average annual rate of
increase for female clerical employment was 6.83%, while that for manufac-

turing was a mere 1.38%. This section will examine how much of the difference
in these growth rates may have resulted from increased numbers of young women
choosing clerical work over that in manufacturing because of changes in schoolV

ing

and in life-cycle participation. The large gains in female employment in

the clerical sector reflect in part the general expansion of the sector as a

whole. But these data are also the result of a shift of women workers from

manufacturing to clerical employment. This shift markedly

reduced the

percentage of manufacturing employees who were women and produced the remark-

ably swift feminization of the clerical labor force. Demand factors undoubtedly
influenced these changes, but there are substantial empirical difficulties in

isolating their importance. Instead of attempting to estimate a complete model
of this labor market,the coefficients from the earnings functions of Section 1
will be used to explore the possible impact of certain supply side effects.
Assume

that

the female labor supply schedule to the two sectors is

one of constant elasticity, which in rate of change form is given by

If wages in the two sectors change at the same rate, then k = 0

clerical employment relative to that in the manufacturing sector. If all or

most of the change in k was a function of the supply side forces stressed
above, one can compute their possible impact on relative changes in employ-

ment for given values of the elasticities. All that remains to be shown is

that a reasonable set of supply side changes can account for most of the
change in k ,

and

that the earnings functions and life cycle labor

force participation in 1890 can account for the initial value of k
It will be assumed that equi1ibriun in the labor market necessitates

Both (9) and (10) are linear approximations to the quadratic forms in Tables

2 and 3 to facilitate computations. Equation (9) is piecewise in accordance
with the results on married women in manufacturing.

Around the turn of this century, few married women worked for pay
outside their homes and most young women entering the labor force could expect

to work continuously until marriage. Most industrial censuses at that time
indicate that work began at about age 15 in manufacturing, and it seems reason-

able to assume here that work lasted for about 10 years.1 Although 25 is
a somewhat late age at marriage, the cohort of single women working in 1890

married later than did any other in American history, and it is possible that

work itself delayed marriage for a host of reasons. Assume, as well, that
clerical work required three years of vocational schooling but that the choice
of occupation did not affect the age at first marriage.--1

then x=6.0l ;

If one

that is starting

annual earnings in clerical work would be $407. The ratio of beginning earn-

ings in clerical work to those in manufacturing would be 1.84. Because
market earnings are an average of individual earnings, the initial earnings
must be used to construct earnings by years of experience and these, in turn,
must be weighted by the percentage distribution of years experience in the

two sectors. This ratio of the average of annual earnings in each occupation,

or the value of k ,

is

about 1.65, a figure that is remarkably close

to that of 1.75, derived from the 1890 manufacturing census."

manufacturing

This wedge

wages is required for a competitive equili-

brium in the labor market, given an exogenous set of decisions regarding time
spent in the labor market.

Even had the basic structure of the earnings functions remained
constant over time, there were several changes on the supply side that could

have served to decrease k ,

the

ratio of clerical to manufacturing wages

for women. Several examples will demonstrate the possible impact on relative

wages of these effects. The departure point for these examples will be to

hold the starting wage in the manufacturing sector (wm) at its 1890 level

of $221, and observe (w/w) respond to supply side changes given the
earnings functions and the equilibrium condition of

24

The number of female high' school graduates increased at an impressive

5.9% average annually from 1900 to 1920 and at an even greater 6.2% average

annually from 1900 to l930..' Although the previous analysis implicitly
assumed that the consumption value of education was zero, as incomes rose
parents may have regarded their daughters' education to have a positive con-

sumption value. In the absence of information on this value, assume by way
of example that in 1930 each year of high school was worth one-third of the

earnings per year for a 15 year old in 1890. That is, assume that the con-

sumption value of education was about $75 per year in 1930. The ratio of
the beginning wage in clerical work to that in manufacturing in 1890 would

then fall from the value of 1.84 derived above t 1.67, and the average ratio
weighted by the probability distributions of years experience in each occu-

pation would fall from 1.67 to 1.49. If the consumption value were $100 per
year, the ratio of starting wages would become 1.62 and the weighted average

would be 1.45. A related factor that may have affected relative wages and
the distribution of women between the two occupations was compulsory school

attendance. By the 1920's, every state had a compulsory school attendance
law, and states whose laws were passed much earlier revised their upper age

limits and added further qualifications. Although most of these laws followed
rather than led actual changes in educational attainment, legal restraints

could still have had some affect on the choice of occupations for fema1es."
Earnings in manufacturing were somewhat enhanced by primary education, but

returns beyond about grade 10 were virtually zero. Delaying entry into the
labor force by one year would, however, have increased earnings in manufac-

turing by about 2.2% because of increased maturity. Under these assumptionscompulsory attendance to age 16, if enforced, would have served to lower the

beginning wage ratio (W/Wm) from 1.84 to l.62.1

25

As a final and perhaps most important example, consider that single
women could have had a positive expected probability of remaining in the labor

force after marriage or of returning after childbearing. Although in 1890
few married women were employed in the labor market, by 1940 to 1950 more
than 20% in the prime ages were. Assume that these 20% were the same women
every year, and therefore that each single woman had a 20% probability of

remaining in the labor force until, say, 50 years old. This effect by itself

would serve to decrease the initial ratio (w/w) to about l.62..1/

Of

course, if the probability of being in the labor force after marriage were
a positive function of labor market experience when single, this ratio would

be higher. It should also be added that if parents make education and career
decisions for their daughters, the income from work beyond age 25 or so may
not have been included in their calculus.
These examples are not meant to show precisely how relative wages in
manufacturing and clerical occupations were affected by changes in incomes

and institutions from 1890 to 1930, but to suggest that supply factors of
this kind may have been important in the growth of clerical employment. Addi-

tional factors could also account for the change in relative wage rates: hours
of work may have decreased in the clerical sector relative to those in manufacturing, the amenities of office work may have increased, young women and
their parents may have come to believe that office work was of higher social

status, and so on. Some combination of these factors could easily account for
the entire reduction in the weighted average of k ,

that

is the ratio (w/w),

from its 1890 level to that of 1930. If one therefore assumes that the entire

decrease in (wc/Wm) over this period was a function of such factors, one can
calculate their joint influence on employment changes by using equations (5)
and (6) and assumed values for the three elasticities.

Therefore, had k=0 ,

difference in the average annual rate of change in clerical and manu-

facturing employment would have been narrowed by about 30% for the period

28/
1890 to 1930.—

Put another way, had k=0, the share of the workers

in clerical employment (1-a) would have been 39% by 1930, although in
actuality it was 54% by that date. The chart below gives results for other
reasonable values of the elasticities. For most values, the difference in
the growth rates shrinks by one-third or more. These estimates are considerable, particularly since most explanations of the comparative growth
of these sectors have stressed differences in demand side shifts.

4. Summary
By 1950, clerical work had become synonymous with female employment,

and its various characteristics made it the perfect example of employment
for individuals with intermittant and somewhat abbreviated labor force par-

ticipation. But earlier in the century, manufacturing employment was of
far more importance to women, and the characteristics of its earnings function made it preferable for those who planned to work only when single.

I

have stressed that in the nineteenth century and early into this one, parents
may have severely restricted their daughters' education, thereby limiting

occupational choice to work in manufacturing. As real incomes rose and
commercial schools spread, young women delayed their entrance into the labor

force and opted in greater numbers for clerical work. The rapid rise of
clerical work in the early twentieth century may also have been fostered by
a greater expectation on the part of these young women to return to the
labor force or remain in it after marriage.

The earnings functions estimated with data from the 1888, 1907, and
1940 samples have demonstrated the extreme differences between manufacturing

and clerical work. On-the-job learning was an essential part of work in
manufacturing, but aging appears to have eventually limited dexterity and

therefore earnings. Clerical work, on the other hand, required a minimum
amount of off-job training, and earnings were considerably higher for those

with education beyond high sdhool. As opposed to work in manufacturing,
clerical work enabled the substitution of off-job training for that on—thejob. Time away from clerical employment, and not aging itself, appears to
have been an important factor in affecting earnings, but this atrophy of

skills or loss in seniority was not of overwhelming importance. Therefore

28

as high school education spread and as the labor force participation rates
of older women rose, particular characteristics of the clerical occupation
gave it an advantage over manufacturing work.

The parameters of the earnings functions estimated in Section 1 were
used in Section 3 to predict the decline from 1890 to 1930 in relative wages

for clerical and manufacturing work. The supply side changes mentioned were
shown to have been of sufficient importance to have generated the large re-

duction in the ratio of wages, (w/w)

.

Finally,

the impact of these

changes on the growth of employment in the two sectors was assessed. In
conclusion, clerical work is viewed here as offering women a vector of occu-

pational characteristics which became more valuable over time. Its earnings
function, which has been more recently viewed as typical of women's employment, replaced one having nearly opposite characteristics in manufacturing,
a form of employment which had earlier been viewed as typically female.

FOOTNOTES

1. Mincer and Polachek (1974) stress the role of skill depreciation in
accounting for differences in earnings between men and women. Polachek
(1979) continues this work by estimating atrophy rates for various occu-

pations. However, see Sandell and Shapiro (1978) on these points, as
well as the reply by Mincer and Polachek (1978). Zeilner (1975) puts
more emphasis on the role of training and on the relative flatness of the
female earnings function.

2. The Federal Census of Manufactures, 1890, Part I, Table 5, pp. 92-114 gives
the figure of 35% but understates pieceworkers in textile mills. The
figure of 47% results from adjusting the manufacturing census information
with piece rate data from the Commissioner of Labor, Eleventh Annual Report:
1895-96; Work and Wages of Men, Women and Children (1897).

3. Fourth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Labor, 1888. Working Women in
Large Cities (1889) was the product of Carroll Wright's long concern with

the conditions of work for women and immigrants. It contains data on

17,427 women in 343 different industries across 22 cities, but because
the original schedules do not exist, city-industry cell averages were used

instead. The 1907 Study is the Report on Condition of Woman and Child
Earners in the U.S. in 19 Volumes, Senate Documents Vols. 86-104 (1910/11).
Data for married women were taken from New York City (0.572), Philadelphia

(0.168), and Chicago (0.104) for the clothing industry, and Massachusetts
(0.097) and North Carolina (0.059) for cotton textiles, where the numbers
in parentheses indicate percentage of the sample. About 15% of the married
working women in the sample were not employed in these industries but were
included in the survey because their children were.

The sample for

30

single women and girls was taken from all these cities except Philadelphia,
in approximately equal proportions.

4. Schooling is measured indirectly in the 1888 Study. For this reason,
the average returns to schooling are substantially higher for those data
than for the 1907 Study because the 1888 measure implicitly included

returns to maturity. But the marginal increment to earnings from a year
of education around the mean is about the same in both studies.

5. The literacy variable is not included in the Table 2 regression, When it
is entered together with the schooling variable, it substantially reduces

the impact of schooling to a marginally significant 1.6% per year, The

schooling squared term then becomes insignificant. It should also be
noted that the technique used for converting months of school attended
into years of schooling may introduce error, biasing the schooling

coefficient towards zero, if days attended per month varies across
individuals or states

6. The 1907 Study contains indiviIual data for boys under 17 years old and
aggregate data for males of all ages. See also Joan Hannon, "The Immigrant
in the Promised Land: Human Capital and Ethnic Discrimination in the
Michigan Labor Market," unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Wis-

consin (1977), Table 3.5 for adult male earnings equations in 1889.

7. This statement leaves open the reasons for the early curtailment of
training, whether they be rational, as a function of limited job market
attachment, or discriminatory on the part of the labor market, or paternalistic on the part of the family.

8. Only 3% of the 1907 sample of single women had over 15 years of experience.
A more flexible function form using dummy variables for years of experience,
also demonstrated that earnings peaked at 15 years experience.

31

9. A pooled regression of single and married women using dummy variables
for ages indicated that earnings peaked at about age 32 and that married
women earned about 10% less than did single women, correcting for days

worked and industrial home work. There was virtually no significant
impact from interacting age and marital status. The lower wages for
married women independent of age and location of work might indicate a
depreciation in skills from time spent at home between work spells but
might also reflect their more limited opportunities because of home duties.

10. Manufacturing jobs were extremely taxing physically, and many involved
the use of irritating chemicals and dust

11. A description of the 1930 survey can be found in Women's Bureau Bulletin
#120, Ethel Erickson, "The Employment of Women in Offices," (1934) and
that for 1940 in Women's Bureau Bulletin #188, Parts 1 to 5 (1942),
"Office Work in Houston, Los Angeles, Kansas City, Richmond, Philadelphia."

The 1940 Philadelphia survey contained data onl2,489women and 7,988 men.
12. Median salaries rise continuously at about 3 to 4% per year, with years
experience in the present firm, unconditional on education. See Women's
Bureau Bulletin #120, "The Employment of Women in Offices" (1934).

It

should also be noted that the male earnings profile for clerical work

rises far more than does that for women. This finding is similar to that
found for contemporary earnings profile for males and females ostensibly

in the same set of occupations, (e.g. King 1977).

where S is years in school.

14. Mincer and Polachek (1974) find a 1% to 1.5% decline in earnings from home
time after the birth of the first child, although their standard errors

are quite large. They also find that their measure of atrophy increases
substantially with the woman's education.

I find essentially the same

result. When my measure of home time is interacted with years of schooling,
the equation becomes:

Log Y =

" + 0.05 H -

0.007

(S*H)

(0.0307) (0.0029)

where H=years home time and S=years at school. Therefore 2.n Y/H<0
when S>7, and the mean S=ll.5 for the 1940 Study. It should also
be noted that home tiime in the 1940 Study was positive for single women, who

had an average break between work spells of 0.31 years, although it was

higher for married women who had on average break of 1.09 years. Almost
all of the home time was accumulated between the time these women began all
office work and the time they began work for their present firm.

in the nature of clerical work since the late nineteenth century.

16. Douglas' (1930) data are fromp. 361, Table 133, column 3 for average
annual earnings in clerical work, and p. 246, Table 88, column 1 for average

annual earnings in manufacturing. His clerical category also included
salaried personnel.

17. See Rotella (1977), p. 268, Table 6.3. Her 1930 data are derived from
estimates by Paul Douglas and Erika Schoenberg made after Douglas computed

his combined male-female averages. The raw data are:

18. The survey of Ohio clerical workers was reprinted as Women's Bureau Bulletin
#95, Amy C. Maher, "Bookkeepers, Stenographers, and Office Clerks in Ohio

1914 to 1929" (1932). Wages for females in manufacturing during this period
are given in National Industrial Conference Board Study Number 229, M. Ada
Beney, Wage, Hours, and Employment in the U.s. 1914-1936 (1936). The two

series and the ratio aregiven below. Douglas (1930, p. 366) was puzzled
by the fact that there were much larger increases in clerical wages in the

Maher study than in his. To the extent that the Maher data are biased up-

ward in trend, the decrease in (w/w) would be even greater than that reported below.

19. The parameter k=(Wc/Wm)(l + (Wc_Wm/Wm))=(l +

(S/wm))

where, for example,

s=schooling costs required for clerical work properly amortized. The model
formulated is identical to that used for an excise tax. The wage in manufacturing (wm) is treated as the "base" wage with the clerical wage as the

"base" wage plus the tax. Therefore, Wc

is

not directly entered in (4).

It should also be noted that the implicit assumption in the work that follows
is the homogeneity of the labor force with respect to the factors affecting

k. A more elaborate model would assume that these factors were distributed
in some way across the population. A description of a market equilibrium
in which heterogeneous workers sort themselves among occupations having
different training components can be found in Rosen (1972).

20.

It is somewhat difficult to compute total years work experience for women
who have completed their working lives from information on the distribu-

tion of years experience of the working population. This problem is akin
to computing the expectation of life at birth from information on the age

distribution. In the same sense that the expectation of life at birth will
depend on the rate of natural increase, the final work life will depend

upon the net rate of increase among female manufacturing employees. In

35

this way one can use stable population theory to convert a distribution
of years work experience into an expected lifetime work experience for

an average worker. The data in Working Women in Large Cities

(1889, pp.

220-1) on the distribution of years work experience yield an estimate of
about 8 years for the expected number of years work. The figure of 10
years is used in the example for convenience, and a lower figure would in

fact raise the equilibrium (w/w)

.

See Goldin (1979),

for a discus-.

sion of this procedure.

21. About 75% of the women in the Women's Bureau 1930 study of clerical
workers had attended high school. Of those clerical workers less than 21
years old in New York City, for example, 35.3% had graduated from high

school. Furthermore, one-third of the women across all ages had some commercial business school training, other than that provided in high school.

22. The starting annual earning of $221 is computed from the Table 2 earnings
equation for a worker with 5 years schooling, working 280 days per year,
living in New York City or Chicago, and beginning work at age 15.

23. This calculation uses the following two work experience distributions:

The distribution for years experience on the job in manufacturing closely

approximates that in the 1888 Study (1889, pp. 220-221). That for clerical

36

work is a gross approximation

to the distribution for work experience

among clerical workers in 1930

discounting is to
age 16 and one year increased maturity adds
2.2% to starting earnings in

28. The average

for the four decades 1890 to 1930 was 6.825% and that

was 1.375%. Therefore the difference was 5.45 percentage

points, which would have been reduced to 3.84 percentage points had
and the percentage reduction is (1.61/5.45) = 30%.
