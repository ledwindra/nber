ABSTRACT
Previous studies of event returns surrounding bank mergers show that banks gain value in
megamergers and additional value when they absorb in-market competitors. A portion of these gains
has been traced to the increased bargaining power of banks vis-à-vis regulators and other
competitors. We demonstrate that increased bargaining power of megabanks adversely affects loan
customers of the acquired institution. Wealth losses are greater when loan customers are
credit-constrained, the loan customer is smaller, or the acquisition is an in-market deal. These
findings reinforce complaints that the ongoing consolidation in banking has unfavorably affected the
availability of credit for smaller firms and especially capital-constrained firms.

How Have Borrowers Fared In Banking Megamergers?
Previous studies of event returns surrounding bank mergers show that banks gain value in
megamergers and additional value when they absorb in-market competitors. A portion of
these gains has been traced to the increased bargaining power of banks vis-à-vis
regulators and other competitors. We demonstrate that increased bargaining power of
megabanks adversely affects loan customers of the acquired institution. Wealth losses are
greater when loan customers are credit-constrained, the loan customer is smaller, or the
acquisition is an in-market deal. These findings reinforce complaints that the ongoing
consolidation in banking has unfavorably affected the availability of credit for smaller
firms and especially capital-constrained firms.
1. INTRODUCTION

Differences in relative bargaining power inevitably affect the outcome of bilateral
negotiations. In banking, bargaining takes place in three arenas: between banks and their
regulators; between banks and their customers; and between acquiring institutions and
target firms.

This paper uses event-study methods to investigate how presumptive

changes in the balance of bargaining power engendered by merger announcements affect
the benefits and costs that corporate customers are expected to encounter in dealing with
an enlarged megabanking firm.
Gains in mergers arise either through efficiency improvements or through
increases in market power (Focarelli, Panetta and Salleo, 2002). Although bank merger
announcements

routinely

project

subsequent

improvements

in

efficiency

and

diversification, statistically significant net increases in the market capitalization of the
combining banks seldom occur. The value of the target stock usually increases, but this
increase typically occurs at the expense of the acquirer’s stock value (Houston and
Ryngaert, 1994; Houston, James and Ryngaert, 2001).
However, mergers involving megabanks show a different pattern. The stock of
megabank acquirers typically gains value when the acquirer announces an acquisition.
Moreover, the benefit increases with target size and is larger when the target was
previously competing in-state (Kane, 2000). Kane hypothesizes that megamerger gains
arise in part from improved access to monopoly rents and regulatory subsidies. Whatever

2

04-20-05
scale and scope economies might exist in production and distribution costs, mergers
eliminate an actual or potential competitor, while increased size strengthens market
presumptions that the institution is both Too-Big-to-Fail (TBTF) and, in future disputes
with customers and regulators, “Too big to Discipline Adequately” (TBTDA). Resulting
increases in the market power of the bank and in the intangible value of the government’s
credit enhancement lower its funding costs and increase its market capitalization.
Evidence that mergers enhance the value of bank debt (Penas and Unal, 2004) supports
this interpretation.
How megabank mergers affect the expected financing costs of established loan
customers is the econometric focus of this paper. On the one hand, any newfound
efficiencies in loan production and contracting might translate into lower borrowing
costs, while the increased political clout of the post-merger entity would lessen the
chance that its failure could force a longtime borrower to lose its intangible investment in
favorable ties with bank officers. Looking at the 1984 collapse and subsequent rescue of
Continental Illinois Bank, Slovin, Sushka, and Polonchek (1993) provide evidence that
customers’ wealth falls and rises with fluctuations in their lending institution’s financial
health. In studies of banking problems in Japan, Korea, and Norway, Brewer et al
(2003), Bae, Kang and Lim (2002) and Ongena, Smith and Michalsen (2003) respectively
show that bank problems and failures reduced borrower stock prices, especially for more
dependent and poorer-performing loan customers
On the other hand, mergers threaten to hurt at least some customers and can do so
in three ways. First, post-merger staffing cuts may displace some (or all) of the particular
officers whose favor the customer had previously cultivated. Surviving loan officers are
unlikely to be aware of every important contact the customer has previously had with one
partner or the other. Second, in eliminating a competitor the merger may curtail some
customers’ bargaining power. Lastly, an enhanced government guarantee would shift
risk to the customer in its capacity as a taxpayer.
Studies of bank mergers in Norway, Belgium, and Italy indicate that bank mergers
affect customer stock prices, relationship exit rates, and credit costs respectively.
Karceski, Ongena, and Smith (2005) find that Norwegian bank merger announcements
reduce the equity value of small publicly traded firms that are target customers.

3

04-20-05
Consistent with the hypothesized joint effect of large in-market mergers on competitive
pressure and of reduced competitive pressure on customer bargaining power, the decline
increases with the size of the target bank. In the Norwegian environment, the stock
prices of relationship customers of the acquiring bank increase.
A relationship customer is one that enjoys a history of successful contacts with a
bank. Following Belgian bank mergers, Degryse, Masschelein and Mitchell (2003) find
that target customers are more likely than acquirer customers to have their relationships
terminated with their bank. These effects are more pronounced for smaller customers
with no alternate lending relationships.

In Italy, Sapienza (2002) finds that, contract

interest rates on bank loans fall when banks with small shares of the local banking market
combine. The contrary result is observed for mergers of large Italian banks. This
differential finding for large and small bank mergers is consistent with the joint
hypothesis that economies of scale exist only for very small banks and that, only when
markets are competitive, are merger benefits shifted into loan rates.
These findings are consistent with studies that indicate that at the margin, after
banks reach a threshold asset size, they channel an increasing proportion of the lending to
large firms.

This pattern implies that megabank mergers threaten to disrupt the

availability of credit to small businesses. Studies by Strahan and Weston (1998) and
Berger, Saunders, Scalise, and Udell (BSSU, 1998) support these concerns. Strahan and
Weston find that, as a proportion of bank assets, small-business lending increases only
when the merging banks are both small, while mergers between medium and large
institutions do not noticeably move this proportion. BSSU find that small-business
lending increases following a merger of small banks, but decreases when large banks
combine.
A 2004 survey by the Association of Finance Professionals manifests similar
concerns in the United States. Nearly two-thirds of the surveyed chief financial officers
and treasurers at companies with revenues of $1 billion or more said a bank had denied
credit or raised loan prices because the corporate executive did not buy additional
services. Executives attribute this to the “growing clout and competition in the banking
industry that have come with consolidation and the repeal of laws separating the banking
and brokerage business” (Sapsford 2004).

4

04-20-05
To investigate how the sign of the net effect varies with merger characteristics
and customer circumstances, this study estimates whether and how merger
announcements for the ten largest domestic U.S. bank mergers between 1991 and 2001
affect the value of intangible customer relationships at target and acquiring banks. On
average, the stock prices of established corporate customers show no statistically
significant announcement effect.

However, once we control for salient merger and

customer characteristics, significant effects emerge. These effects are consistent with the
hypothesis that megamergers consolidate market power in particular market segments.
On average, target customers suffer in all four mergers where the partners show
substantial geographic overlap. As predicted by the bargaining-power hypothesis, very
large customers are undamaged and smaller customers of targets fare especially badly
when the announcement indicates that managers of the target firm are not going to be
treated as equal partners. Finally, losses prove most severe for customers that show
evidence of being credit-constrained.
The paper has four sections. Section II summarizes the economics of bankcustomer relationships and lays out some testable hypotheses. Section III reviews the
construction and properties of our dataset. Section IV outlines the methodology and
Section V presents the results.

Section VI concludes with a discussion of policy

implications and opportunities for future research.

2. SOURCES AND DISTRIBUTION OF INTANGIBLE VALUE IN BANKCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS

Modern banking theory emphasizes that the many and repeated points of contact a
bank has with its established customers generate private information and mutual trust.
Diamond’s delegated-monitoring hypothesis holds that banks either win access to inside
information from good customers or uncover such information through analysis they
undertake in the course of supporting and observing their customers’ loan and deposit
business (Diamond, 1984; Kane and Malkiel, 1965).
Privileged information and a climate of mutual trust allow a bank to assess and
price the risk of lending to a relationship customer more accurately than the bank’s

5

04-20-05
competitors can. In principle, abilities or capacities that create such extranormal returns
are intangible assets. In each relationship, the relevant intangible asset may be portrayed
as a mutual claim to the capitalized value (R) of the reduced opportunity costs. The
outcome of a bilateral bargaining process (BP) allocates R partly to the relationship
customer (RC) and partly to the bank (RB):
RC(BP) + RB (BP) = R(BP).

(1)

Because R requires the cooperation of both parties, equilibrium RC and RB should
each be strictly positive to avoid outcomes that would eliminate the counterparty’s
incentive to renew the relationship.
To derive testable hypotheses about the determinants of the intangible values RC
and RB, we can model R and the differences in bargaining power as functions of a series
of observable bank, borrower, and merger characteristics that might reasonably be
expected to affect their relative bargaining power. Given R, the impact of a megamerger
on a customer’s RC depends on whether and how particular bank and merger
characteristics might alter its bargaining power.

The customer’s bargaining power

increases with its size and the extent to which the importance of the officers that have
handled its business in the past promise to survive post-merger reorganization activity
and decreases if the merger is expected to curtail the customer’s ability to tap alternative
sources of credit on fair terms.

3. DATASET CONSTRUCTION AND DESCRIPTION

3.1 Sample Construction
Our sampling procedure imposes four screens.

First, we see ourselves as

sampling from the universe of loan customers whose banks happened to participate in
each of the ten largest combinations of U.S. domestic banks during 1991-2001.
In identifying bank relationships, Gande et al. (1997) and Narayanan et al. (2004) include
all member banks in a lending syndicate. However, Yasuda (2005) demonstrates that
bank relationships are better characterized by considering only lead lenders in the lending

6

04-20-05
syndicate. Following Yasuda, we identify “relationship” customers as firms for which
one or both combining banks served as a sole lender or lead lender in a syndicate at the
time of the merger announcement using Loan Pricing Corporation’s (LPC) Dealscan
database.1
Identifying firms which have outstanding credit facilities with the combining
banks in each merger and aggregating over the ten mergers produces 6,823 firm
observations involving 4,718 unique firms.2 From these observations, we sample only
those customers that meet the following data-availability restrictions:
1. have daily returns available on CRSP during and 210 days prior to the
announcement window (produces 3,667 firm observations);
2. have balance sheet and income statement data on Compustat (produces 2,677 firm
observations);
3. have observations whose SIC code (=6) does not classify them as financial firms
(produces 2,325 firm observations);
4. have observations that are traded at least 30% of the designated estimation period
trading days and whose event returns did not exceed 15 percent in absolute value
(produces the final sample of 2,204 firm observations).
Financial companies are eliminated on the grounds that abnormal returns for these
customers may be contaminated by changes in their prospects as competitors of the
proposed mega-institution. The other sample reductions lessen distortions associated
with nonsynchronous trading, the concurrent release of important idiosyncratic
information, and potential outliers.

3.2 Variable Definitions
Merger and Market Characteristics. Takeovers raise “issues” of governance,
whose resolution can be more or less friendly to target management.

As Table 1

The Dealscan database provides details of loans over $100,000 compiled from 13Ds, 14Ds, 13Es, 10Ks,
10Qs, 8Ks, and S-series (registration) documents that publicly held companies and those privately held
companies with public debt outstanding file with the Securities Exchange Commission. Lead lenders in
syndicated loans are identified from the LPC Dealscan database if the bank’s role in the syndicate is
characterized by titles such as arranger, co-arranger, administrative agent, agent or co-agent. Lead lenders
typically hold the largest stakes in the loan syndicate and perform the origination and monitoring roles
associated with the loan syndicate.

Firms that are customers of both the acquirer and target in a merger are classified as joint customers.
Eliminating those firms that reappear in another merger does not materially affect our results.

indicates, SNL DataSource characterizes six of the ten megadeals as “mergers of equals.”
In merger-of-equals combinations (MERGE_EQ), it is anticipated that more managers of
target banks will survive in important roles than when the target is absorbed unequally.
To test whether the pre-existing relationship value of target customers is conserved more
fully in merger-of-equal combinations, we define the indicator variable MERGE_EQ,
which equals one in merger-of-equal deals and is zero otherwise.
Mergers may expand an acquirer’s share of existing markets and/or expand its
product line or geographic footprint. Microeconomic theory indicates that a sizeable inmarket acquisition is likely to enhance a megabank’s market power. Seven of the ten
megamergers may be described as in-state acquisitions. Four of these show enough
market overlap to be designated in-market. INMARKET takes on the value one for
customers whose bank engages in an in-market merger; zero otherwise. We classify the
other six combinations as either a market expansion (two cases), or a hybrid (four cases)
based on the degree of deposit-market overlap. The final column of Table 1 lists states
for which the combining banks each previously serviced at least one percent of deposits.
Assuming that in individual state banking markets a bank’s deposit and loan shares are
highly correlated, we define OVERLAP to be a zero-one dummy that equals unity for
customers located in states in which both partners’ have at least one percent of the
deposit market. For example, Norwest and Wells Fargo overlapped in Arizona, Nevada,
and Texas.
Customer Characteristics. The empirical literature provides a guide in proxying

environment

(CREDIT_CONSTRAINED). In the macroeconomic literature on monetary policy and
credit contractions, Gertler and Gilchrist (1994) and Kashyap, Stein, and Wilcox (1993)
show that small firms and firms with limited access to credit markets are more sensitive
to changes in available bank credit. In the merger literature, Strahan and Weston (1998);
Berger et al (1998); Karceski, Ongena, and Smith (2005); and Sapienza (2002) show that
firm size is among the best proxies for customer bargaining power. Kanatas and Qi
(2003) also identify age. Houston and James (1996) and Detragiache, Garella, and
Guison (2000) show that multiple relationships reduce hold-up costs and adverseselection costs. While size, age, and relationships are important determinants of hold-up

8

04-20-05
costs, Rajan and Zingales (1998) show that a firm must also have a financing need.
Consistent with these prior studies, we constructed the following measures:
SIZE: Log of asset size (in $million).
YRS: Log of number of years that the firm’s stock had been trading publicly.
MUL_REL: Zero-one dummy variable that equals one only for customers that
have multiple banking relationships.
PUB_DEBT: Zero-one dummy variable that takes on the value one for
corporations with public bonds outstanding.
EFN: External Financing Needs, (defined as planned investment minus internally
generated funding).
Based on the joint findings of the previous literature, we define a corporation as
potentially “credit-constrained” when it lies in the less-favorable tail of the distribution of
each of the last five variables, that is when:
PUB_DEBT = 0,
YRS < log of 11 years,
SIZE < log of $1 Billion,
EFN > 0, and
MUL_REL = 0.
A zero-one dummy variable (CREDIT_CONSTRAINED) assigns a value of one to
customers that meet this five-way condition

3.3 Sample Description
Table 2 reports the mean value of all variables defined so far for the all-customer
sample and for the subsamples of target and acquirer customers. 3 The table also includes
information on the median asset size and market capitalization of target, acquirer, and
credit-constrained customers.

Across the ten mergers, the respective sizes of the

customer subsamples are: 1,016 target-bank customers; 1,292 acquirer customers; and
104 joint customers (4.7 % of the aggregate sample). The number of customers of all
kinds is 2,204 (= 1,016 + 1,292 – 104).

3

The Appendix describes in a reproducible way how these variables are constructed.

9

04-20-05
The six MERGE_EQ combinations account for 75.6 percent of total customers:
91.0 percent of target customers and 62.4 percent of acquirer customers. All but 11 of
the joint observations occur in three merger-of-equals combinations: Chemical-Chase;
First Union-Wachovia; and Fleet-BankBoston. In mergers of equals, joint customers
may be better positioned to deal with the new management structure, but they also lose an
alternative funding outlet. On the grounds that joint customers have lost an independent
relationship, joint customers are pooled with target customers and eliminated from the
acquirer subsample. However, except that this makes the subsamples closer in size, our
qualitative findings are not sensitive to pooling decisions.4 In-market mergers account
for 32.0 percent of the target sample and 27.6 percent of the acquirer sample. Target
customers in overlapped markets constitute 10.9 percent of the target subsample and
acquirer customers 8.4% of the acquirer subsample.
Although the means of all five customer characteristics differ significantly
between the target and acquirer subsamples, only one merger characteristic
(MERGE_EQ) does so at the 1 percent level.

Assuming that customers of banks

involved in mergers of equals are similar in their characteristics, when such customers
account for 91% of the target subsample but only 62% of the acquirer subsample, average
differences in favor of target customers may emerge.

Our sample indicates that not only

are target customers larger, but with respect to funding needs and alternative credit
access, they seem more favorably situated on average than acquirer customers although
the difference in the mean values of CREDIT_CONSTRAINED variable fails to reach
statistical significance at the 1 percent level. Credit constrained customers, however, are
of similar size across both subsamples.

4. METHODOLOGY

Our paper focuses on the effects that megamerger announcements have on the
stock price of corporations that have an outstanding loan at either or both of the target
4

Pooling decisions are unlikely to impart a bias one way or the other. In addition to primarily being
customers of banks involved in friendly mergers, joint customers are among the larger customers and by
definition are not credit-constrained because they possess an additional relationship. They unlikely to be
adversely affected by the merger whether they placed in the acquirer or target subsample. As a robustness
check, we reran our regressions with a JOINT_CUST dummy. The dummy is always insignificant.

10

04-20-05
bank and its acquirer. For individual customers, a market model is used to estimate and
cumulate Day-0 and Day-1 “Abnormal Returns” to arrive at the cumulative abnormal
returns (CARi). Whether due to projected changes in R or bargaining power, these CARs
should capture whatever net effect the merger has on a borrower’s RC. To investigate
whether the effect is significant, CARi is regressed upon proxies for the customer’s
relationship value (Ri) and bargaining power (BPi).
Regression tests seek to approximate the following latent regression equation:

CARi = ai + bi Ri + ci BPi + ui.

(2)

In estimating (2), the joint influence of Ri and BPi is proxied by variables that exemplify
merger and market characteristics that proxy for the post-merger disposition of target
personnel (MERGE_EQ), for the extent to which the acquirers’ product line and
geographic footprint expand through in-market acquisitions (INMARKET), for deposit
overlap (OVERLAP), and for the intensity of the competitive environment in which the
customer must meet its financing needs (CREDIT_CONSTRAINED). The last variable
combines effects related to a firm’s need for financing and its access to credit.
Regression equations presented in our tables are of the form:

CARi = bo + b1 MERGE_EQi + b2 INMARKETi + b3OVERLAPi + b4
CREDIT_CONSTRAINEDi + vi.

(3)

Our first strand of testing looks at whether differences exist in the means of CARs across
subsamples composed of target and acquirer customers. The second and more important
strand uses equation (3) to conduct two kinds of regression tests. Individual-coefficient ttests tell us whether we can reject the null hypothesis that some or all of the individual
coefficients are zero. Covariance tests investigate whether particular coefficients differ
across the customer subsamples.

5. RESULTS

11

04-20-05
5.1 First-Round Tests
Table 3 presents the two-day mean CARs for all three customer groups. The table
also reports these values for each of the individual megamergers.
Mean abnormal returns are statistically insignificant for all three customer
groups.5 However, the proportion of CARs that are negative (47 percent in each case)
differs significantly from 50 percent. No differences in the CARs are observed across the
three customer groups.
Target customers are significantly affected in three cases, while effects on
acquirer customers are never significant. Target customers benefited in the marketexpansion NationsBank/BankAmerica merger, and lost value in the largely in-market
mergers of BankAmerica with Security Pacific and Fleet with BankBoston.6

5.2 Regression Tests
Table 4 estimates equation (3) for the three sample groups. Model 1, using the
entire customer sample, is our primary model. Controlling for merger and customer
characteristics, the model shows that on average no difference emerges between acquirer,
target, and joint customers in their response to the merger announcement: the dummy
variables TARGET and JOINT_CUST are statistically insignificant. However, the model
does show, through the interaction terms and customer-characteristic variables, that the
customers’ stake in banking megamergers varies with the merger’s character and with the
customer’s economic circumstances.
These effects become apparent in Models 2 and 3 run on the target and acquirer
customer subsamples respectively. Target customers have greater explainable crosssection variation than acquirer customers (R-squared of 4.57% for the targets compared
to 1.67% for acquirers). Target customers suffer significantly if their bank is not treated
as an equal and if they themselves are credit-constrained.

Relative to other target

customers, credit-constrained customers lost 2.0 percent of their value where their bank is

5

Averaging across the mergers—instead of across firms—also produces qualitatively similar results.

6

These results are robust to different market-portfolio construction methods (equally-weighted and valueweighted) and to an alternate standardization of abnormal returns (dividing the abnormal return by the
standard deviation of the prediction error).

12

04-20-05
not treated as an equal.7 Acquirer customers benefited from strictly in-market mergers
(0.9 percent), but were harmed if the partners’ larger geographic footprints materially
overlap (-1.1 percent). Differences between the target and acquirer customer subsamples
are confirmed through covariance tests involving the interaction terms in Model 1. Ftests reported at the bottom of the table establish that coefficients for the market-overlap,
in-market, and credit-constrained indicators differ significantly between the target and
acquired subsamples. 8
In Model 1, the positive slope of the SIZE coefficient assures us that, for largeenough size, adverse effects from other circumstances are overshadowed by benefits of
size. This is our strongest and most important result. In fact, aggregating across the
customer sample as a whole after multiplying each firm’s cumulative abnormal return by
its market capitalization reveals a $47 billion increase in value for sample firms.
As Models 2 and 3 indicate, the positive coefficient on SIZE obtains significance
only for target customers. For a target customer, the breakeven SIZE may be calculated
as the value at which the positive impact of SIZE just equals the sum of the -2.1%
intercept and other relevant considerations. Using the coefficients from an unreported
regression of target CARs on SIZE, the effect of the negative intercept washes out when
SIZE equals about 7.4. This corresponds to a customer asset size of $1.65 billion, which
is greater than the $1.5 billion asset size of the median target customer. Because firms
represented in the CRSP and Compustat databases from which our target customers are
drawn are disproportionately large, it appears that, in the typical megamerger, more than
half of target customers suffer some discomfort.
Controlling for size and other characteristics, outstanding public bonds or
multiple relationships also result in reduced customer value. This is possibly a reflection
of the potential for megabanks to use their enhanced bargaining power to reduce the
benefits customers previously derived from competing funding sources. As the banking
industry continues to consolidate both nationally and globally, it will become

7

The coefficient for TARGET * (1-MERGE_EQ) is - 0.9 and that for
TARGET * CREDIT_CONSTRAINED is -1.1.
8
Introducing industry indicators in the models awards insignificant coefficients to the 1-digit SIC
dummies. However, their inclusion decreases the standard error for the CREDIT_CONSTRAINED
variable. Interacting TARGET and ACQUIRER with the constituents of CREDIT_CONSTRAINED as
opposed to the composite CREDIT_CONSTRAINED variable supports the aggregation procedure.

13

increasingly important to size this discomfort and for society to consider explicitly
whether and how to protect the interests of small and credit-constrained target customers
in megamergers.

6. SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS

Acquirers absorb all tangible and intangible items on the economic balance sheet
of target banks. Intangible items include charters, strategies, managerial skillsets, and—
as emphasized here—access to established customers. In any repeat business, customer
relationships are important assets. This paper studies whether and when stockholders of
customer firms worry about whether, under the new regime, their borrowing capacity
might decline or credit terms become more rigorous.
On average in the ten merger deals studied here, acquirer customers fared much
better than customers of target banks. In our sample, target customers experienced
significantly negative two-day returns in three circumstances. Small credit-constrained
corporations lost on average $3 million (or 1.23%) in market cap. In unfriendly and inmarket combinations, adverse effects were more common.

Stockholders of target

customers lost an average of $46 million (0.86%) in unfriendly mergers and $31 million
(0.32%) in in-market deals.9 Although regression analysis puts a finer edge on these
differences, they are visible even in the market-value changes individual firms
experience.
These findings are worrisome because the consolidation of large U.S. banks
shows few signs of stopping. In 2004, Morgan acquired Bank One and Keycorp will join
the list of top-ten banks if and when its in-market deal with CharterOne goes through. If
bank consolidation intensifies capital constraints for small business, macroeconomic
growth may be curtailed. Further, given that smaller companies create the largest portion
of new jobs in our economy, our results suggest bank consolidation may adversely affect
the job-creating capacity of the small-business sector. For this reason, we urge regulatory
officials to investigate whether they can replicate our results across larger samples of

To estimate the market-value change for the sector, we take the average of the multiple of CAR times the
market capitalization of the customer.

post-1990 banking mergers and to place increased emphasis on how acquirers plan to
preserve target-bank relationships.

Description
The percentage cumulative abnormal return for the 2-day event
period combining the day of the announcement and the day
following the announcement [CAR(0,1)]. For all abnormal
returns, the estimation period is the 200 days ending 11 days prior
to the announcement.
An indicator variable that equals 1 if the firm has public debt
outstanding and is 0 otherwise (based on Compustat data).
The natural log of the market value of assets in $ millions for the
firm. From Compustat, the market value of assets = data6 - data60
+ market capitalization - data50. All outlying values are
winsorized at the 5th or 95th percentile.
The log of the number of years that the company has been listed
on either the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ, where the maximum
number of years was set at 25 (based on CRSP data).
The average external finance needs during the last 3 years – based
on the method developed by Rajan and Zingales (1998). If less
than 3 years of data are available, we employ the available data.
From Compustat, EFN = (data128 - (data18 + data14) + (data3 data3a) + (data2 - data2a) - (data70 - data70a) - (data71 data71a))/data128. Outlying three-year average values are
winsorized at the 5th and 95th percentile.
An indicator variable that equals 1 if the firm has more than one
banking relationship as shown in the LPC database, and is 0
otherwise.
An indicator variable that equals 1 if the merger was a merger of
equals as defined in SNL DataSource and presented in Table 1;
equals 0 otherwise.
An indicator variable equal to 1 for customers headquartered in
one of the states that show significant overlap in market share as
defined in the Federal Reserve Database and presented in Table 1;
equals 0 otherwise.
An indicator variable equal to 1 if the merger was defined as an inmarket merger, as presented in Table 1; equals 0 otherwise.
An indicator variable that takes on the value of 1 if the firm is a
customer of both the target and the acquirer bank, and is 0
otherwise.
An indicator variable that equals 1 if the firm is a customer of the
target bank, and is 0 otherwise.
A zero-one dummy variable that takes on the value of 1 for
customers of the acquiring institution, and is 0 otherwise.
An indicator variable that takes on the value of 1 if the firm is
credit-constrained. We define credit-constrained customers from
Compustat: if YRS < 11 and SIZE < 500 and EFN > .001,
PUB_DEBT = 0, and MUL_REL = 0; otherwise its value is 0.
