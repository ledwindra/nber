ABSTRACT
Human beings want to believe that good outcomes in the future are more likely, but also want to make
good decisions that increase average outcomes in the future. We consider a general equilibrium model
with complete markets and show that when investors hold beliefs that optimally balance these two
incentives, portfolio holdings and asset prices match six observed patterns: (i) because the cost of biased
beliefs are typically second-order, investors typically hold biased assessments of probabilities and
so are not perfectly diversified according to objective metrics; (ii) because the costs of biased beliefs
temper these biases, the utility costs of the lack of diversification are limited; (iii) because there is a
complementarity between believing a state more likely and purchasing more of the asset that pays
off in that state, investors over-invest in only one Arrow-Debreu security and smooth their consumption
well across the remaining states; (iv) because different households can settle on different states to be
optimistic about, optimal portfolios of ex ante identical investors can be heterogeneous; (v) because
low-price and low-probability states are the cheapest states to buy consumption in, overoptimism about
these states distorts consumption the least in the rest of the states, so that investors tend to overinvest
in the most skewed securities; (vi) finally, because investors with optimal expectations have higher
demand for more skewed assets, ceteris paribus, more skewed asset can have lower average returns.

This paper studies portfolio holdings and asset prices in an economy in which people’s
natural tendency to be optimistic about the payout from their investments is tempered by
the ex post costs of basing their portfolio decisions on incorrect beliefs. We show that this
model can generate the following three stylized facts.
First, households’ portfolios are not optimally diversified according to various theoreticalbased measures (Marshall E. Blume et al. (1974), William N. Goetzmann and Alok Kumar
(2001) , Laurent E. Calvet et al. (2006), Stephanie Curcuru et al. (forthcoming)). The costs
of this lack of diversification appear to be modest. Most households hold a well-diversified
portfolio of mutual funds and also a significant amount of one or two additional stocks.1
Second, and part of the evidence for the first fact, household portfolios are tilted towards stocks with identifiable attributes, and in particular towards holdings of individual
stocks with positive skewness. Further, undiversified households hold individual stocks that
have relatively high idiosyncratically skewed returns and their portfolios have relatively high
idiosyncratically skewed returns (Todd Mitton and Keith Vorkink (forthcoming)).
Finally, positively skewed assets tend to have lower returns. This is true for stocks in the
US stock market in general (Yijie Zhang (2005)) as well as for specific well-studied examples,
such as the value-growth premium and the long-run underperformance of IPOs.2
This paper argues that these three patterns are observed because human beings both
want to believe what makes them happier and want to make good decisions that lead to
good outcomes in the future. We consider an exchange economy with two periods and
complete markets in which households with log utility invest in the first period and consume
in the second period. We show that these patterns arise in this economy when investors
hold beliefs that optimally trade-off the ex ante benefits of anticipatory utility against the
1

Further, and complementary evidence for our purposes, household income risk is not fully-insured by
households across groups of households, where moral-hazard would seem an implausible reason for this failure
(Orazio Attanasio and Steven J. Davis (1996)).

There is also complementary evidence from gambling behavior. Lotteries are highly skewed assets, and
the demand for lottery tickets rises with probability controlling for expected return. And, in parimutuel
betting on races, in which the bettors determine returns in equilibrium, long-shots have lower expected
returns than favorites.

ex post costs of basing investment decisions on biased beliefs.
Our model of beliefs follows the optimal expectations framework of Markus K. Brunnermeier and Jonathan A. Parker (2005). We assume that people behave optimally given
their beliefs, choosing portfolios that maximize their expected present discounted value of
utility flows.3 Because investors care about expected future utility flows, they are happier
if they overestimate the probabilities of states of the world in which their investments pay
off well. But such optimism would lead to suboptimal decision making, and lower levels of
utility on average ex post. Optimal beliefs trade-off these competing forces: people’s beliefs
maximize the objective expectation of their well-being, the average of their expected present
discounted value of utility flows. This economic model of beliefs balances the anticipatory
benefits of optimism against the costs of basing actions on distorted beliefs. Because the
costs of small deviations from optimal behavior are of second order, and the anticipatory
benefits of biases in probabilities typically are of first-order, optimal subjective and objective probabilities differ. Christian Gollier (2005) and Brunnermeier and Parker (2005) study
portfolio choice and asset prices in incomplete markets (and a two-state complete market
example). This paper derives a general characterization in a complete markets economy.
In terms of portfolios, we show in Section I that an investor with optimal expectations
does not fully diversify its portfolio but instead biases upwards (a lot) its subjective beliefs
about the likelihood of one state and biases downward (a little) its subjective beliefs about the
likelihood of all the remaining states. It does this because there is a natural complementarity
between believing a state more likely and purchasing more of the asset that pays off in that
state. Once a state is perceived as more likely, one wants more consumption in that state, and
once one has more consumption in that state, one wants even more to believe that that state
is more likely. We further show that an investor chooses to be optimistic about the states
associated with the most skewed Arrow-Debreu securities: either the least expensive state

market returns (or internet stock returns) are highly significantly correlated with the share of their portfolio
in equities (or in internet stocks).

(when states are equally likely) or the least likely state (when state prices are actuarially fair)
or the least expensive and least likely state when these coincide (in general). This happens
because low-price and low-probability states are the cheapest states to buy consumption
in, and so distort consumption in the rest of the states the least (for a given bias). Thus
portfolios are not perfectly diversified, households overinvest in the most skewed assets, and
household portfolios have positively skewed returns.
In general equilibrium, we show in Section II that investors tend to be optimistic about
different states. Thus investors’ portfolios have idiosyncratically skewed returns and consumption insurance appears to be incomplete. In terms of asset prices, this preference for
skewed returns has price effects. Ceteris paribus, states with relatively small probabilities
tend to have relatively low expected returns.4
All proofs are contained in the appendix.

I. Portfolio choice with optimal expectations
The economy has two periods. There are S possible states of the world in period 2, with
state s having objective probability π s > 0. An investor with subjective beliefs π̂ s allocates
his wealth among a complete set of Arrow-Debreu securities in the first period and consumes
the payoff from this portfolio in the second period. A person’s investment choices, c =
{c1 , c2 , .., cS }, maximize his expected utility given his subjective beliefs, π̂ = {π̂ 1 , π̂ 2 , .., π̂ S }:

V1 = max

Nicholas C. Barberis and Ming Huang (2005) show that exogenous belief distortion as proposed by
Prospect Theory can lead to similar investment and price patterns. Gollier (2005) shows that in an incomplete
markets investment problem with a stock and a bond, optimal expectations imply that the investor biases
up the probability of the states in which the risky asset’s returns are the highest and the lowest, as implied
by Prospect Theory. Thus, in this situation, overweighting extreme events is an endogenous outcome of the
trade-off between the benefits of anticipatory feelings and the suboptimality actual outcomes, rather than
being an exogenous characteristic of human beings.

initial wealth is normalized to unity.5 Optimal portfolio choices exist and are unique:

Optimal beliefs. But what are the investor’s subjective beliefs? One assumption is
that people hold rational expectations, an extreme assumption typically made both for its
tractability and for the discipline it provides. Further, the argument goes, since objective
beliefs lead to the best decisions and thus the highest average present discounted value of
utility, people have the incentive to acquire information and learn rationally so that their
beliefs should have a general tendency to converge to objective probabilities.
But in fact, rational beliefs do not lead to the highest expected present discounted value
of utility flows. An investor can increase V1 by holding quite distorted beliefs, trading
on these, and then anticipating high average future utility. But biased beliefs come at a
cost. A person that makes objectively poor investment decisions has lower utility ex post,
V2 = ln c, on average. Our theory balances these effects – it trades off the anticipatory
benefits of optimism against the utility losses caused by decisions based on optimistic beliefs.
Further, this approach provides discipline: biases in beliefs are determined endogenously by
the economic environment.
Formally, each investor’s beliefs maximize his well-being, defined as the average expected
utility across periods 1 and 2 when actions are optimal given subjective beliefs. That is,
π̂ maximizes 12 E [V1 + V2 ] subject to the constraints that the π̂ s are probabilities and that
portfolio choices are optimal given π̂. This wellbeing function is similar to that proposed in
Andrew J. Caplin and John Leahy (2000), and analogous arguments support our use of this

While here we assume ps > 0, Section II endogenizes prices and derives this as a result.

(and subject to π̂ s ≥ 0). Beliefs impact well-being directly through anticipation of future
flow utility and indirectly through their effect on portfolio choice.6
Because c∗s (π̂) is continuous in subjective probabilities, L is also; and since probability
spaces are compact, optimal beliefs exist. Further, if π̂ s = 0, c∗s (π̂) = 0 and the investor
would get infinite negative utility if state s is realized.

right-hand-sides are horizontal lines, independent of beliefs, that are higher for states that
are more expensive per unit of probability. By Proposition 1, we know that µ is such that the
left-hand-side of each first-order condition intersects the right at least once (with 0 < π̂ s < 1

This approach is a ‘frictionless extreme’ in the sense that only ex-post costs limit biases in beliefs.
Additional factors might also constrain biases.

for all s). Thus, each first-order condition has one or two solutions.7 If for state s, the
right-hand side equals one, then objective beliefs are the only possible solution. Otherwise,
the right-hand side is greater than one, and, by the concavity and linearity of the two sides,
there are two solutions to the first-order condition, one with a positive bias and one with
a negative bias. From the second-order condition if beliefs about the probability of s0 are
biased upwards, so that π s0 /π̂ s0 < 1, then π s /π̂ s > 1 for all s 6= s0 so that beliefs about the
probabilities of all other states are biased downwards. Further analysis of the program shows
that objective beliefs are optimal beliefs only if S = 2 and π 1 = π 2 and p1 = p2 .
Proposition 2: If S = 2 and π 1 = π 2 and p1 = p2 , objective beliefs are optimal. Otherwise:
(i) one and only one state has upward-biased subjective probability, all other states have
downward-biased subjective probability: ∃ s0 such that π̂ ∗s0 > π s0 and π̂ ∗s < π s for all s 6= s0 ;
(ii) among states with downward-biased subjective probabilities, states with larger priceprobability ratios (economy-wide stochastic discount factors) are biased down by larger fac7

Equations (4) are Lambert W functions in π s /π̂ s and in general no closed-form solution exists.

iff ps0 /π s0 = ps00 /π s00 .
The result that the investor biases upward the probability of only one state comes from
a natural complementarity between the subjective belief about a state and the level of consumption in that state. Once a state is perceived as more likely, one wants more consumption
in that state, and once one has more consumption in that state, there are greater benefits to
believing that that state is more likely. The second part of the proposition is driven by the
same force. An investor purchases less consumption in a more expensive state, and so has a
greater incentive to believe that the more expensive state is unlikely to occur.
For the remainder of this section, we rule out the knife-edge case that delivers rational
expectations.
Assumption 1: Either S > 2 or π s 6= 1/2 or p1 6= p2 .
We now characterize which state an investor is optimistic about. The benefits of optimism
about a state are related to the consumption purchased in that state and the costs are related
to the objective misallocation of consumption across states. The costs are second-order, so
for an infinitesimal change in beliefs a person should bias upwards the probability of the
state in which they have the most consumption. Starting from objective beliefs, this is the
cheapest state in terms of price-probability ratio.
Analogously, optimal expectations, which are not infinitesimal deviations from rational
expectations, tend to bias upward the probability of the cheapest state because extra consumption in that state requires the least decrease in consumption in the remaining states,
where ‘cheap’ refers to a combination of low price and low ratio of price to probability. If all
states have the same ratio of price to probability, the investor biases upwards the probability
of the lowest price (and probability) state. If states have equal objective probabilities but
vary in price, then the investor overestimates the probability of the least-expensive state

7

because this requires the smallest reduction in consumption in the other states.8
Proposition 3: (i) If all states have the same price-probability ratio, ps /π s = m for all s,
the investor overestimates the probability of (one of) the state(s) with the lowest probability.
(ii) If all states are equally likely, π s = π for all s, then the investor overestimates the
probability of (one of) the state(s) with the lowest price-probability ratio.
(iii) If one state has both the lowest probability and the lowest price-probability ratio,
then the investor overestimates the probability of this state.
(iv) For any state, there exist m̄ and m, such that for a sufficiently low price ps ≤ mπ s
optimal beliefs overestimate the probability of this state, π̂ ∗s > π s , and for a sufficiently high
price ps ≥ m̄π s optimal beliefs underestimate the probability of this state, π̂ ∗s < π s .
The labels of ‘optimism’ and ‘pessimism’ in Figure I.1 denote the actual optimal beliefs
when states have equal probability: the state with the lowest price per unit of probability
is viewed with optimism and the remaining states are viewed with pessimism (Proposition
3(ii)). Figure I.2, discussed subsequently, displays the first-order conditions when states are
priced fairly.
Optimal portfolio choice. While beliefs are interesting, our ultimate interest is in
explaining prices and quantities, that is, returns and portfolios.
Consider first the case of actuarially fair prices, ps /π s = m for all s. Under rational
expectations, the optimal portfolio is risk-free. For optimal beliefs, Equations (2) and (4)
imply first-order conditions 1/mcs + ln mcs = µ − 1 + ln m for all s, where the Lagrange
P
multiplier µ is such that c̄π s0 + c s6=s0 π s = 1/m and (c, c̄) are the two solutions to this
equation: c̄ is the consumption level in the state with positively-biased subjective probability,
and c is the consumption level in the remaining states. This can be seen in Figure I.2,
which displays the first-order conditions when prices are actuarially fair. Because the right8

Other effects are present – the elasticity of consumption to beliefs, and the curvature of the utility
function matter – but this is the strongest effect here.

hand-sides are identical, all pessimistic biases are identical. The following corollaries follow
directly.
Corollary 1: (Preference for skewness) If ps /π s = m for all s, then the investor prefers
the most skewed assets: the investor buys c̄ of one of the Arrow-Debreu securities that pays
off with the smallest probability and c < c̄ of each of the remaining securities.
Corollary 2: (Two-fund separation) If ps /π s = m for all s, then the investor holds a
portfolio consisting of the risk-free asset (an equal amount of all Arrow-Debreu securities)
and an additional positive amount of one and only one of the most skewed securities.
These Corollaries match two of the empirical findings described at the start of the paper.
First, investors are well diversified except for investing in one asset. Second, both the return
on the additional asset they hold and the return on their portfolios are positively skewed.
When prices are not actuarially fair, investors still do not optimally diversify and invest
more than the investor with rational expectations in securities with skewed returns. The
9

latter occurs both because investors tend to be optimistic about states with low probabilities and prices (Proposition 3) and because pessimism is more severe for states with high
prices (Proposition 2(ii)). In general, diversification, preferred by an agent with rational
expectations, would destroy skewness, preferred by an agent with optimal expectations.
As we now show, equilibrium prices tend to make different investors optimistic about
different states, and so portfolios in equilibrium tend to be heterogeneous and have idiosyncratically skewed returns.

II. Asset pricing in an exchange economy with optimal expectations
We consider an exchange economy with a unit mass of investors, S > 2, and aggregate per
capita endowment in each state of Cs . Due to space constraints, we consider an example
that illustrates the general characteristics of optimal expectations equilibria. In this economy,
portfolios are heterogeneous across investors, portfolio returns are idiosyncratically skewed,
and securities with positively skewed returns have lower expected returns.
Definition: An optimal expectations equilibrium is a portfolio ci and beliefs π̂ i for each
agent i and prices p such that: (i) each agent’s portfolio is optimal given his beliefs and
prices; (ii) each agent’s beliefs maximize his well-being; (iii) the market for each asset clears.
Before analyzing a more complex environment, consider first an economy with equally
probable states, π s = π, and no aggregate risk, Cs = C = 1. Suppose that prices are
actuarially fair, ps = p. Each investor biases upward the subjective probability of one state,
purchases c̄ of the Arrow-Debreu security associated with this state, and purchases c < c̄ of
the Arrow-Debreu security associated with the remaining downwards-biased states (where
c̄ and c are as defined in the previous section). This is an equilibrium if an equal share
of agents are optimistic about each state, so that demand for consumption is equal across
states, and each asset’s price is p = 1/S. This equilibrium is locally stable, in the sense that
a small change in prices would lead all investors to bias up the subjective probabilities of
10

the cheapest states (Proposition 3(ii)), which would lead to excess demand for consumption
in these states and a (relative) increase in price for the cheapest states.
Consider now similar economies in which the variation in the aggregate endowment across
states is ‘not too large.’ An equilibrium with actuarially fair prices exists as long as there exist
different shares of agents that are optimistic about each state so that the demand for each
asset matches the supply. Thus, in economies with equally probable states and low aggregate
risk, prices are fair and agents hold heterogeneous beliefs, overinvest in different skewed
assets, and thus hold portfolios with idiosyncratically skewed returns. In the corresponding
rational expectations equilibrium, investors’ portfolios would be homogeneous and perfectly
diversified, cs = Cs . Further, also unlike in the rational expectations equilibrium, aggregate
risk, in limited amounts, is not priced.9 People have an interest in risk, and a small amount of
aggregate risk satisfies this desire without changing prices. Finally, as aggregate endowment
risk increases beliefs become less heterogeneous.
Proposition 4: (Heterogenous portfolios and idiosyncratic skewness) Suppose that
π s = π for all s. For any vector (C1 , ..., CS ) of aggregate endowment such that c ≤ Cs ≤ c̄
PS
and
s=1 Cs = c̄ + (S − 1)c, there exists an optimal expectations equilibrium with the
following characteristics:
(i) prices are actuarially fair: ps = p for all s;
(ii) for all s, a fraction λs = (Cs − c)/(c̄ − c) of investors buys c̄ of the Arrow-Debreu
security associated to state s and c of the security for every other state;
where c and c̄ are defined in Section I.
Having established this result, we now construct our example that matches all three stylized facts discussed in the introduction. Consider an economy with some unlikely states and
some likely states. At actuarially fair prices, each investor would bias upward his probability
9

The equality of probabilities across states is key for this results. With unequal probabilities, aggregate
risk is typically priced.

of one of the unlikely states. Analogously to Proposition 4, this is an equilibrium if there
exists shares of investors that are optimistic about each unlikely state such that the market

clears. For example, if π s = π and Cs = C := s c̄ + 1 − s c for s ≤ s and π s = π B > π A
and Cs = C B := c for s > s, then an equilibrium with fair prices exists in which 1/s investors
bias up their probabilities for states s ≤ s. But if the endowments across states are not so
different, then prices in the unlikely states must be relatively higher so that demand for
output is also relatively lower in these states, and hence the expected returns of the most
skewed Arrow-Debreu securities are lower.
Proposition 5: (Underperformance of skewed assets) For a small reduction in C A −
C B such that ps does not change for s > s, ps increases for s ≤ s so that:
(i) the securities with the more skewed returns have lower expected returns than in a
rational expectations equilibrium;
(ii) the securities with the more skewed returns have relatively lower expected returns,
π A /ps < π B /ps0 for all s ≤ s and s0 > s.
This equilibrium fits all three stylized facts: (a) portfolios are heterogeneous and not
perfectly diversified; (b) each investor overinvests in one security that is more skewed than
the average security and his portfolio return is more skewed than the market return; (c) more
positively skewed securities have lower returns. These results relate to the use of co-skewness
as a pricing factor. As C A varies (and in richer environments), the relative importance of
idiosyncratic skewness and aggregate skewness for asset prices varies. Finally, consumption
insurance appears incomplete, but not because of missing markets or moral hazard, but
rather because households optimally choose to hold risk.
How important are the assumptions of our example? First, if the low-probability states
have much larger endowments than the other states (Cs > C A ), then we still match (a) and
(b), but the expected returns on the most skewed assets are higher for the usual reason that
investors discount payouts in states with high aggregate endowment. However, even in this
12

case, Proposition 5(i) implies that the returns on the most skewed assets are lower than in a
rational expectations equilibrium. Second, the assumption that some probabilities are equal
is not essential. If probabilities differ among high-probability states, nothing changes. If
probabilities differ among low-probability states, prices would have to be higher for lower
probability states for investors to remain indifferent among (perhaps a subset) of states and
for portfolios to be heterogeneous.
The desire for skewness can also impact the market return. If bad aggregate states have
low probabilities, as for disasters or Peso problems, then it is possible for the desire for
skewness to increase the equity premium, as investors seek to avoid negative skewness.
In conclusion, the natural human tendency towards optimism tempered by the real costs
of poor decisions, implies that people hold heterogeneous, underdiversified portfolios to attain
skewed returns, and that this behavior reduces the returns of positively skewed assets.

Appendix: Proofs
A. Proof of Proposition 1
n
o
PS
Define the set Π = π̂ : 0 ≤ π̂ s ≤ 1, s=1 π̂ s = 1 . Optimal consumption choices given beliefs are continuous in probabilities on Π (Equation (2)). The objective for beliefs (Equation
(3)) is thus continuous in beliefs on Π since L is linear in π̂ and continuous in c. Since Π
is compact, a maximum exists on Π. To see that the optimum requires 0 < π̂ s < 1 for all
s, note that for π̂ such that π̂ s = 0 for at least one s, c∗s = 0, and thus the objective for
beliefs has value negative infinity and this cannot be optimal since the objective is finite on
the interior of Π.¥

B. Proof of Proposition 2
To establish the results, we first prove four lemmas. Without loss of generality, we choose
units so that

ps = 1.

s=1

This implies that ps /π s = m = 1 for all s for actuarially fair prices.
Lemma 1: The subjective belief of at most one state is biased upwards.
Proof of Lemma 1: The second-order condition, Equation (5), implies
π̂ 2s [π̂ s0 − π s0 ] ≤ π̂ 2s0 [π s − π̂ s ] for all s 6= s0 .

(B.1)

Thus if beliefs about the likelihood of s0 are biased upwards, so that π̂ s0 − π s0 > 0, then
π̂ s − π s < 0 for all s 6= s0 .¥
The proof of Lemma 1 also directly implies Lemma 2.

16

Lemma 2: If the subjective belief of one state is biased upwards, then the subjective
beliefs of all other states are biased downwards.
Lemma 2 corresponds to result (i) in Proposition 2, except that we still need to prove that
rational expectation cannot be optimal except in the case in which prices are actuarially fair,
probabilities are equal, and there are only two states. We first examine the case of actuarially
unfair prices.
Lemma 3: If prices are not actuarially fair, rational expectations cannot be optimal.
Proof of Lemma 3: The first-order conditions (4) for rational expectations are

1 = µ − 1 + ln

ps
for all s
πs

which cannot be satisfied for all s if ps /π s 6= ps0 /π s0 for some s and s0 .¥
Combining lemmata 2 and 3 implies that there is one, and only one, state whose probability is biased upwards when prices are actuarially unfair. In the remaining proof of result
(i), we assume that prices are actuarially fair.
Lemma 4: If prices are actuarially fair, ps /π s = 1 for all s, then the investor biases his
beliefs for all states with downward-biased subjective probabilities by a common factor: For
one state, s0 , cs0 = c̄ ≥ 1 and π̂ s0 = c̄π s0 ≥ π s0 , and for all other states, s 6= s0 , cs = c ≤ 1 and
π̂ s = cπ s ≤ π s , where (c, c̄) are the two solutions to
1

with µ such that c̄π s0 + c

(B.2)

π s = 1.

Proof of Lemma 4: Equation (B.2) is the first-order conditions for optimal beliefs written
in terms of consumption using Equation (2). If µ = 2, cs = 1 for all states, in which case
beliefs are objective and the Lemma holds trivially (c = c̄). If µ > 2, every first-order
condition has the same two possible solution, so that cs = π̂ s /ps = π̂ s /π s is the same among
17

all states whose likelihood is biased down. For these states let c := c∗s (π̂). Then Lemma
1 implies that there is at most one state perceived as more likely than it is, and let its
consumption level be c̄. We note µ < 2 is not possible by Proposition 1.¥
We now prove that the one specific case has rational expectations and part (i) for actuarially fair prices by using these Lemmas to analyze the program given by Equation (3).
Let π denote the probability of the state whose probability is biased upwards, and let
c be the consumption level in that state, which is denoted s0 . By Lemma 3, we know that
the consumption level is a constant c in all other states. Using the fact that π
b = cπ, we can
rewrite the Lagrangian objective for beliefs as a function of only c̄ and π:

U (c̄, π) is maximized

over the choice of state to bias upward and consumption level in that state. We proceed in
two steps.
Suppose that we know the state, and thus its objective probability π, whose belief is
biased upwards. We determine the optimal bias c in the following way. Notice first that
U (1, π) = 0 and that
∂U

(c̄, π) = π ln

∂c̄2
c̄2 (1 − πc̄)2

(B.3)

When π = 1/2, the right-hand side of the above equality is negative, implying that U is
concave in c̄. Combining this with Uc̄ (1, 1/2) = 0 directly implies that c̄ = 1 (and so π
b = π) is
optimal if π = 1/2. This sheds light on the special case with only two states that are equally
likely. In that case, the choice of the state whose probability would be biased upwards is
arbitrary, and we have just shown that it is optimal not to distort beliefs. We now argue
that in all other cases, π̂ 6= π.
First, we show that if we consider π < 1/2, then c̄ > 1/2π so that π̂ > 1/2 > π. When π is
less than 1/2, we see from (B.3) that U is alternatively concave, convex and concave (in c̄) over
the intervals ]0, 1], [1, 1/2π] and [1/2π, 1/π]. Combining this with U (1, 1/2) = Uc̄ (1, 1/2) = 0
implies that the optimal solution has a c̄ larger than 1/2π.
Second, we show that given π, the optimal c̄ has c̄ ≤ (1 − π)/π, or equivalently that
π
b ≤ 1 − π. This follows from

q(π) =

∂U 1 − π
1 − π 2π − 1
(
, π) = 2π ln

∂c̄
π

being negative when π is less than 1/2.10 This implies that c̄ ≤ (1 − π) /π or π̂ ≤ 1−π which

This is because q(1/2) = 0, and
q 0 (π) = 2 ln

q 00 (π) =

so that q 0 (1/2) = 0 and q 00 has the same sign than π − 0.5. This implies that q has the same sign than π − 0.5.

19

implies that the state perceived as more likely than it is necessarily has π ≤ 1/2. Combined
with the first result, we know that if the optimal π 6= 1/2, we have π̂ s 6= π s for all s (“for all
s” follows from Lemma 2).
What we still need to show is that π 6= 1/2 when there are more than 2 states with one
state having probability 1/2. We do this by showing that the function V (π) = maxc̄ U (c̄, π)
is symmetric and U-shaped with a minimum at 1/2. Thus, as long as there exists a state with
probability different from 1/2, π̂ 6= π. V is symmetric around π = 1/2 from the definition
of V . By the envelop theorem, we have that

V (π) =

where c̄ maximizes U (c̄, π). Suppose that π is less than 1/2. We have seen above that it
implies that c̄ is larger than 1/2 but smaller (1 − π)/π, yielding V 0 (π) < 0. This shows
that the optimal state to bias upwards is the objectively least likely one. Except the case
π 1 = π 2 = 1/2, this state has a π less than 1/2, which implies that c < 1 < c. This concludes
the proof of result (i) in Proposition 2.
The above proof also directly implies Lemma 5, used in the proof of Lemma 6.
Lemma 5: If prices are actuarially fair, ps /π s = 1 for all s, then π̂ s0 ≥ 1/2 where s0 is the
state whose probability is biased upwards.
Proposition 2(ii) follows directly from the first-order conditions, Equation (4). Given
that one selects the solution with π s /π̂ s > 1, the left-hand side is increasing in π s /π̂ s and
the right-hand side is increasing in price-probability ratio, ps /π s .¥

C. Proof of Proposition 3
Proposition 2 implies the pattern of belief distortion but does not specify which is the state
that has its probability biased upwards.
20

The proof of part (i) relies on the function V (π) defined in the proof of Proposition 2(i)
as the value of holding beliefs that are optimistic about state s0 where π is the probability
associated with this state. The proof of Proposition 2(i) shows that this function, V (π), is
symmetric and U-shaped with a minimum at 1/2. Further, the proof of Proposition 2(i)
shows that the optimal s0 is necessarily such that π ≤ 1/2. Thus, V (π) is maximized by
choosing to bias upwards the probability of (one of) the smallest probability state(s).
To prove part (ii), we show that the local maximum in which subjective probabilities
satisfy the first-order conditions and the budget constraint with an arbitrary optimistic state
is dominated by the same set of subjective probabilities in which the subjective probability
of this state and the cheapest state are interchanged.
Let states 1 to s̄ be the least expensive states, ps = ps0 < ps00 for s0 , s ≤ s̄ and s00 > s̄. Let
π̂ ∗ (s00 ) denote the vector of subjective probabilities that satisfy the first-order conditions,
sum to one, and have π̂ s00 > π s00 and π̂ s < π s for all s 6= s00 and let L (π̂ ∗ (s00 ) , p) denote the
associated value of the objective for beliefs:

This is feasible because it is still the case that probabilities sum to one and as a result the
budget constraint is also satisfied. For notational simplicity, for the moment, let π̂ ∗s = π̂ ∗s (s00 ).

where the sign follows from the initial assumptions that ps0 < ps00 and that optimism is
focussed on state s0 so that π̂ ∗s00 (s00 ) > π > π̂ ∗s0 (s00 ).
Since π̂ Switch (s00 ) is not optimally chosen for the situation in which the investor biases
upward his beliefs about state s0 , these probabilities may not satisfy the first-order conditions
and so are weakly worse than those that are optimally chosen conditional on being optimistic
about state s0 :
¡
¢
L (π̂ ∗ (s0 ) , p) ≥ L π̂ Switch (s00 ) , p
Thus we have,
¡

L (π̂ ∗ (s0 ) , p) ≥ L π̂ Switch (s00 ) , p > L (π̂ ∗ (s00 ) , p) for all s00 > s̄ and s0 ≤ s̄

which completes the proof of part (ii).
For part (iii), we make a similar argument. Let states 1to s̄ be the least expensive and
lowest probability states, ps = ps0 < ps00 and π s = π s0 < π s00 for s0 , s ≤ s̄ and s00 > s̄. Consider
taking π̂ ∗ (s00 ) for some s00 > s̄ and switching the subjective probability for state s00 (π̂ ∗s0 (s00 ))
with the subjective probability of some state s0 ≤ s̄ (π̂ ∗s0 (s00 )) and let this vector be denoted

Analogously to part (ii), since π̂ Switch (s00 ) is not optimally chosen for the situation in
which the investor biases upward his beliefs about state s0 :
¡
¢
L (π̂ ∗ (s0 ) , p) ≥ L π̂ Switch (s00 ) , p

Thus we have,
¡
¢
L (π̂ ∗ (s0 ) , p) ≥ L π̂ Switch (s00 ) , p > L (π̂ ∗ (s00 ) , p) for all s00 > s̄ and s0 ≤ s̄

which completes the proof of part (iii).
For part (iv) of Proposition 3, we first note that, for any problem, there is a lower bound
placed on µ by the requirement of real solutions to the first-order conditions (Proposition
1). Thus,

¾
½
ps
µ ≥ µ := max 2 − ln
s
πs

(C.1)

Second, for any problem, there is an upper bound placed on µ by the requirement that the
π̂ s0 < 1 in the solution to the first-order condition for the probability that is positively-biased
state. Thus, for state s0 to have π̂ s0 > π s0 , we require
µ < µ̄ (s0 ) := 1 + π s0 − ln ps0 .
23

Consider first m. As one decreases ps0 , µ increases (at least once ps0 /π s0 is the minimum),
µ̄ (s0 ) increases, and µ̄ (s) for s 6= s0 does not change. Thus, there is an ms0 such that for
ps0 = ms0 π s0 , µ̄ (s0 ) > µ and µ̄ (s0 ) < µ for all s 6= s0 . Thus, the agent must be optimistic
about state s0 . Then m = mins0 {ms0 }.
In terms of m̄, as one increases ps0 , there is an m̄ such that for ps0 = m̄π s , µ̄ (s0 ) < µ
and µ̄ (s0 ) > µ for some s 6= s0 . Thus, the agent must be pessimistic about state s0 . Then m̄
= maxs0 {m̄s0 }.¥

D. Proof of Proposition 4
Proof by construction in the text.

E. Proof of Proposition 5
This Proposition is not trivial because, while an increase in the price of a given state decreases
the demand for the asset that pays off in that state, an increase in the price of a state for
which π̂ ∗s < π s decreases the demands for the assets that pay off in all other states that are
viewed with pessimism. Following the proof of Proposition 5, we prove two Lemmata that
characterize these price effects in Section F.
We start with the following Lemma.

which is positive if π̂ s0 > 1/2. This follows from from Lemma 5.¥
For notational simplicity, let a index the states s ≤ s so that π s = π a and Cs = Ca for
s ≤ s, and let b index the S − s states with π s = π b and Cs = Cb . Let a0 be the state, less
than or equal to s, that is viewed as more likely than it is; this state differs across investors
but all a-states are symmetric so we can impose that pa0 = pa .
To prove Proposition 5, we write the conditions for the initial equilibrium with fair prices,
totally differentiate the system for a small increase in the aggregate endowment in the astates, dCa , imposing that dpb = 0, show that dpa > 0, and check that dCb < 0. Because
there is a discrete interval between π a and π b and because the wellbeing functions evaluated
for different choices of s0 (the state such that π̂ s > π s ) are continuous in prices, small enough
changes in pa and pb do not change the relative rankings of the wellbeing as a function of s0 .
25

Thus, locally the pattern of a0 across investors remains unchanged.
E1. Equilibrium conditions at fair prices
The exogenous variables are S, s, π a . Given these three, π b is given by the fact that
probabilities sum to one
sπ a + (S − s) π b = 1.
For actuarially fair prices that (normalized) sum to one, we have

pa = π a
pb = π b .

unique. Note that c =

E2. Totally differentiated equilibrium conditions

From equation (E.8), we have that dµ > 0, and from equations (E.6), we have that
dπ̂ b < 0, and so from equation (E.7), we have dCb < 0.
Thus, reversing signs, for a small reduction in aggregate risk – a decrease in Ca and an
increase in Cb – such that the expected returns on the less-skewed assets do not change,
dpb = 0, the expected returns on the more skewed assets rises, dpa < 0.¥

If π̂ t < π t , then our result also follows if this inequality is satisfied because that implies

Lemma 8: (Cross-price effects for fair prices) For π s /ps = 1 for all s and t such that

t 6= s , c∗s (π̂ ∗s (p) , ps ) is increasing in pt if π̂ ∗s > π s or π̂ ∗t > π t , otherwise it is decreasing in pt
as long as it remains true that π̂ ∗s < π s .
Proof of Lemma 8: If the investor switches to become optimistic about state s as we
increase the price of the state previously viewed with optimism, then we have our result.
Increasing the price of another state cannot cause the investor to switch their optimism from
the state viewed with optimism.
So under the assumption that the investor remains optimistic about the same state, using
Equation (2), for any s 6= t, the change in portfolio for a small change in pt is
