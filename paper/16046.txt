Exports, Borders, Distance, and Plant Size

NBER Working Paper No. 16046

JEL No. F1,L11
ABSTRACT
The fact that large manufacturing plants export relatively more than small plants has been at the foundation
of much work in the international trade literature. We examine this fact using Census micro data on
plant shipments from the Commodity Flow Survey. We show the fact is not entirely an international
trade phenomenon; part of it can be accounted for by the effect of distance, distinct from any border
effect. Export destinations tend to be further than domestic destinations, and large plants tend to ship
further distances even to domestic locations, as compared with small plants. We develop an extension
of the Melitz (2003) model and use it to set up an analysis with model interpretations of ratios between
large plant and small plant shipments that can be calculated with the data. We obtain a decomposition
of the overall ratio into a term that varies with distance, holding fixed the border, and a term that varies
with the border, holding fixed the distance. The distance term accounts for more than half of the overall
difference.

Introduction

Large manufacturing plants export relatively more than small plants (Bernard and Jensen
(1995)).

This fact has been at the foundation of a large and in‡uential literature that

analyzes international trade at the plant level, including Melitz (2003); Eaton and Kortum (2002); and Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003).

The literature focuses on

how large plants overcome impediments to international trade, such as investing in foreign
distribution channels as emphasized in Melitz (2003).
The starting point of this paper is the observation that the plant-size export relationship
may not be entirely an international trade phenomenon. It can also be accounted for by
the e¤ect of distance, apart from any border e¤ect. Large plants may tend to ship further
distances than small plants, even for internal ‡ows to domestic destinations. Since foreign
destinations typically are further than domestic destinations, any advantage large plants
might have in long distance shipping would make them more likely to export, even if large
plants had no particular advantage in surmounting international trade borders.
This paper presents a straightforward generalization of the Melitz (2003) model in which
plants make one investment to overcome distance barriers and a second investment to overcome border barriers. We show how the plant-size/export relationship can be decomposed
into two terms. The …rst term, the size-distance ratio, depends on distance shipped, holding
…xed the border. The second term, the size-border ratio, varies the border, holding distance
…xed.

These ratios— which can be calculated directly from the data— have a theoretical

interpretation in the model in terms of barriers to distance and barriers at the border.
Our empirical analysis uses the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), a micro data set at
the U.S. Census Bureau on shipments originating at U.S. manufacturing plants. This data
resource is unique in the comprehensive way that it tracks originations and destinations
both for domestic shipments and for exports. We use these data to decompose the plantsize/export relationship into its distance and border components. We …nd that the distance
component is more than half of the total overall relationship.

The …nding is robust over

various alternative ways we cut the data. In short, we …nd that not only are large plants
more likely to export, they are also more likely to ship long distances within the United
States, compared with small plants.

The estimated relationship between plant size and

distance shipped internally within the United States is large enough to account for more
than half of the plant-size/export relationship, in a sense that we make precise.
It is natural to expect that the same forces that might determine whether or not a

1

plant in Michigan is selling to export markets like Mexico, would also determine whether or
not the plant is shipping long distance within the United States to places like California or
Maine. By the same logic that plants might need to make investments in foreign distribution
channels, they also might need to make investments in domestic distribution channels as well.
Fully understanding this mechanism is useful if we want to understand trade ‡ows and how
they might change with changes in policy. For example, it may not make much di¤erence
for a government trade agency to assist a Michigan plant with Spanish-language paperwork
needed for exports to Mexico, if the Michigan plant is unable to overcome the internal
distance barrier to shipping goods to Texas.
The analysis is closely related to the border study literature initiated by McCallum
(1995). (See Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) for a more recent treatment and Anderson
and van Wincoop (2004) for a survey.)

Our paper follows this literature in the way it

disaggregates the geography of a country and distinguishes between internal trade ‡ows
within a country and external trade ‡ows across borders. In the literature, to determine
the border e¤ect, trade between two locations within the same country at a given distance
is compared with trade between locations separated by a border, but otherwise the same
distance. Our paper is distinct from this earlier literature because rather than look at the
level of trade by distance and border, our paper looks at the changes in trade by distance
and border, comparing them with changes in plant size. The fact that we are di¤erencing
by plant size means we don’t have to get into details about demand (e.g., gravity) that are
front and center in the earlier border literature. In what we do, demand di¤erences out. In
summary, our paper takes from the border literature its disaggregated geography and uses it
to analyze the plant-size/export relationship, which plays a central role in plant-level trade
literature. We thereby connect two important literatures.
While we frame the theoretical discussion in terms of an extension of the Melitz (2003)
model of investments in distribution channels, as this theory is well known and tractable for
our purposes, our empirical results are equally applicable for the theory we develop in Holmes
and Stevens (2010). That paper argues that even within narrowly de…ned industries, small
plants tend to perform retail-like functions that are di¢ cult to trade (e.g., custom work),
compared with large plants in the same industry. This factor not only explains why a small
Michigan plant would be unlikely to do business in Mexico, it also explains why the small
Michigan plant would be unlikely to do business in California.

Our …ndings in Holmes

and Stevens (2002, 2010) that small plants tend to be geographically di¤use and follow
the distribution of population, while large plants tend to be geographically concentrated, is
2

consistent with the shipment distance …ndings reported here. As the small plants follow the
distribution of population, they can meet demand by serving local customers, just like retail
stores do. As the large plants may be concentrated in just a few locations, goods must be
shipped to distant locations that have no source of local supply.
We mention a few other related papers. Hummels and Hillberry (2003, 2008) were the
…rst to use the micro data version of the CFS. They used these data to conduct a border
analysis analogous to what McCallum did for the U.S.-Canada border, only Hummels and
Hillberry looked at the e¤ect of state borders within the United States.

Our paper shares

a common feature with Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009) in being a transaction-level
analysis of shipments linked to characteristics of the shipment source. (See also Bernard,
Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007).) Their data are based on the administrative records
of all international trade transactions that go through customs.

Theory

We present a generalization of the Melitz (2003) model in which plants make shipments of
varying distances both to domestic locations and foreign locations. As in Melitz, plants can
make investments to lower the marginal cost of distribution. What is di¤erent here is that
these investments can be made both for domestic shipments as well as foreign shipments.
We use the model to develop ratios and then take ratios of ratios, setting up the main
empirical analysis of the paper. The ratio analysis is useful, because various model terms
cancel out in the ratios and enable us to isolate empirical magnitudes that are relevant for
sorting out the relative importance of the size/distance relationship and the size/border
relationship.

2.1

Description of the Model

There is a discrete set of locations, indexed by `, some of which are domestic and others of
which are foreign. We start by describing the environment for a particular plant located at
a particular domestic location and later add more notation to take account of other plants.
The demand for the plant’s product at a location ` (which may be di¤erent from where the
plant is located) depends on the local price p` the plant sets to the location, as well as the
population N` at the location, and takes the following functional form
D(p; M` ) = N` p` .
The parameter

(1)

is the (constant) elasticity of demand. The parameter

is …rm-speci…c

and scales up demand for a plant’s product at given price. We interpret the parameter
as a measure of the plant’s product quality. Note that quality

is not indexed by location,

meaning all locations value the quality attribute of the plant’s product the same way. The
plant can produce one unit of the good at its location at marginal cost of !.
Now, consider a particular location that is a distance m miles away from the plant. For
simplicity, we temporarily drop the subscript `. In selling to this location, the plant faces a
distance friction. In addition, if the selling location is in the foreign country, the plant faces
a border friction.
The extent of the distance friction is summarized by a variable a, which has the standard
“iceberg transportation cost” form, so that if the plant intends to deliver one unit to the
location, it has to ship a

1. We allow the transportation cost a to be altered by the plant

making an investment x to improve its distribution network to the particular market. In
particular, suppose the required investment to attain transportation cost a depends on the
size N of the market as well as the mileage m to the market in the following way
x = N f (a; m);

(2)

where f ( ; ) is a continuously di¤erentiable function. Thus, the cost of investing to lower
transportation cost scales up proportionately with market size, i.e. the location’s population.
Make the following assumptions on the shape of f :
f (1; 0) = 0

(3)

and for a > 1 and m > 0,
@f
> 0,
@ ( a)

(4)

@f
> 0,
@m

(5)

@2f
> 0;
@ ( a) @m

(6)

and there exists a lower bound a(m)

1, such that

lim f (a; m) = 1, m > 0.

a!a(m)

(7)

while
f (a; m) < 1, for a > a(m), m > 0.

(8)

Assumption (3) just says that when the mileage distance is zero, no investment must be made
to attain the zero transportation cost limit of a = 1. Assumption (4) says that reducing
the transportation cost raises the investment cost. (We di¤erentiate with respect to ( a)
rather than a because it is more convenient to refer to reducing a rather than raising a.)
Assumption (5) says that the investment cost to attain a given level of transportation cost
increases in the mileage distance m.

Assumption (6) says that the cost of reducing the

transportation cost increases in mileage m. Finally, (7) with (8) is an Inada condition that
ensures an interior choice of a for m > 0, above a lower bound a(m).
Analogous to the way the distance friction is modeled, the border friction is summarized
by a variable b, which also has the iceberg cost format. Holding distance m …xed, to get
one unit over the border, the plant must ship b

1 units. Analogous to the way a can be

altered, we allow the plant to alter b by making investments. Suppose there is an ad valorem
tari¤ . The plant chooses a level of b

1 + . (We keep b bounded above 1 +

because

the tari¤ must be paid, regardless of the investment.) The extent that b is above the tari¤
re‡ects other barriers at the border, such as language or dealing with the complexities of
shipping to the foreign country. The plant can lower b by making an investment. Let y be
the investment in reducing border costs and assume it takes the form
y = N g(b),

5

for continuously di¤erentiable g( ). Analogous to the distance friction, the cost of reducing
the border friction to a foreign destination increases proportionately with the destination’s
population. We assume

and that there is a

dg(b)
> 0,
d( b)

(9)

lim g(b) = 1,

(10)

g(b) < 1, for b > 1 + .

(11)

so that
b!1+

but

Assumption (9) says it costs resources to lower the friction. Assumptions (10) and (11) are
an Inada condition ensuring an interior choice of b above 1 + .

2.2

Optimal Firm Behavior

Given the distance and border frictions a and b, the plant has constant marginal cost of a!
to deliver one unit to a domestic location and ab! for a foreign location. (Again, ! is the
constant marginal cost of production at the plant’s location.)

Since demand is constant

elasticity, the pro…t maximizing price if the location is domestic equals a markup over costs,
pD (a) =

1

a!;

(12)

ab!.

(13)

and if foreign
pF (a; b) =

1

Next, consider the plant’s choice of a and b. For a domestic location, the plant chooses
a to solve

(15)

The second line follows from straightforward substitution of (12) and (1) into the above. The
third line collects the various multiplicative parameters that a¤ect sales. Observe that the
population N of the market enters multiplicatively in both revenues and cost, so it doesn’t
a¤ect the solution. Observe that the quality parameter

and the cost parameter ! can be

aggregated, along with , into a summary parameter , that we will refer to as the plant’s
productivity measure. Productivity is higher, the higher the quality and the lower marginal
cost.
Analogously, for a foreign destination, a and b are chosen to solve,
(a ; b ) =

This structure generalizes the familiar Melitz (2003) environment in a straightforward
way. In Melitz, rather than a continuous relationship between the friction b and investment
spending x, there is a discontinuous relationship. In particular, suppose the investment cost
g(b) takes the following form:
g(b) = y, for 1 +

b<1

= 0, for b = 1.
For this special case of the g function of our model, if the plant makes no investment, then
exports are prohibitively expensive, b = 1. But if the plant makes an investment of y, the

border friction reduces to the tari¤ level. Suppose we also eliminate the distance friction in
the model by setting a = 1. Finally, normalize population to N = 1. Then, problem (16)
of the plant reduces to paying the …xed cost y to earn
(1 + )

(

1)

y,

in the foreign market, or paying no …xed cost and earning zero in the foreign market. It is
immediate that there is a productivity threshold ^ such that if > ^ it pays for the plant to
7

export but otherwise the plant doesn’t export. Productivity

scales up plant size, so this

is the famous Melitz result that large plants are more willing to pay a …xed cost to set up
an export channel.
Making the relationship between the frictions and investments continuous, and adding
both a distance friction as well as a border friction, leads to the same qualitative insights as
in Melitz.2 Let aD ( ; m), aF ( ; m), and bF ( ; m) denote the solutions to problems (14) and
(16) as a function of plant productivity

and distance to market m. The following result

provides our key comparative statics results about the solution to the plant’s problem.
Proposition 1. Assume (3) through (11) hold.

Then (i) the optimal choice of the fric-

tions aD ( ; m), aF ( ; m), bF ( ; m), all decrease in

and increase in m, (ii) the inequality

aD ( ; m) < aF ( ; m) holds, and (iii) as productivity gets arbitrarily large, the frictions go
to the lower bounds, lim

!1

aD ( ; m) =a(m), lim

!1

aF ( ; m) =a(m), and lim

!1

b( ) =

1+ .
Proof of (i). We prove the result for the case of a foreign destination; the case of a domestic
destination is similar.

Let

F (a; b;

; m) denote the pro…t per capita in a foreign market

given choices a and b, and given productivity

and market distance m. (This is the term

in braces in the second line of (16).) Treating ( a) and ( b) as the choice variables, the

The

monotone comparative statics results discussed in Milgrom and Shannon (1994) then directly
imply the result.
Proof of (ii).

Observe the domestic market is just like the foreign market except the

equivalent border term for the domestic market bD = 1 without paying any costs. Next, note
assumption (10) implies bF ( ; m) > 1 + . The result then follows from the supermodularity
of

F

in ( a) and ( b).

Proof of (iii). This follows from the FONC and the Inada assumptions (7), (8),(10), and
(11). Q.E.D.
The logic underlying Proposition 1 is exactly the scale economy logic in Melitz. The
larger market of a more productive plant will make it more willing to pay …xed cost to
lower marginal costs both with regards to the distance friction as well as the border friction.
Consider next a given plant selling to two markets the same mileage distance, but one is
domestic and the other is foreign. Given the border friction in the latter market, there is
greater sales volume in the former market. Hence, a plant will be more likely to invest in
reducing the distance friction in a domestic market of a given mileage distance than a foreign
market.

Ratios

Later in this paper, we will be working with revenue data by plant size class.

In this

subsection, we show how we can take ratios of revenues across di¤erent plant size groupings
in such a way that various model parameters cancel out, providing us with useful statistics
that can be connected to the model and that provide insight.
Our …rst step is to derive formulas for revenues. The revenue measures will be net of
the transportation cost and border frictions a and b, as this corresponds to what we have in
the data. Let RD (m; ) be net sales revenue for a plant of productivity

summed over all

domestic locations m miles away. To derive the formula, let ND (m) be the total population
summed over all domestic markets at distance m. Given , sales per capita in each distance
m domestic market is the same in each market. Using formula (12) for price and plugging
this into demand (1), it is straightforward to derive that domestic market per capita revenue
given a equals
for a type

a

(

1)

. Taking into account population, domestic revenue at distance m

…rm equals
(

RD (m; ) = ND (m)

1)

aD

.

(19)

Note that for simplicity, we leave implicit the dependence of aD on

and m. Analogously,

revenue (net of frictions) on foreign sales at distance m equals
RF (m; ) = NF (m)

aF

(

b

(

.

(20)

Now, we de…ne the key ratios. We will refer to domestic locations that are m = 0 miles
away as “near” locations and examine sales relative to this. De…ne the Export-Near Ratio
to be the ratio of foreign sales at distance m relative to domestic near sales. This ratio can
be decomposed into a product of the Distance Ratio and the Border Ratio as follows:

10

RF (m; )
RD (m; ) RF (m; )
=
RD (0; )
RD (0; )
RD (m; )
Export-Near Ratio = Distance Ratio Border Ratio

(21)
(22)

The Distance Ratio takes domestic sales at distance m relative to near domestic sales. (So
the destination county is held …xed.) The Border Ratio is export sales at distance m relative
to domestic sales at distance m. (So distance is held …xed.) Using the formulas (19) and
(20), we can rewrite the decomposition (21) of the Export-Near Ratio as
ND (m) (
RF (m; )
=
a
RD (0; )
ND (0) D
(

are evaluated at the far distance m.

Note, here we

make use of the fact that aD (0; ) = 1; i.e., there is no distance friction at zero miles.
Next, we compare plants of di¤erent

H

and take ratios of ratios. Let

>

L

be high

and low productivity levels and de…ne the Size Export-Near Ratio by taking the ratio of
the far-near ratios for the two productivity types, putting the high type in the numerator.
Analogous to (21), it can be decomposed into a product of two terms,

From Proposition 1, aH
D < aD , i.e., the larger plant invests more to lower the distance friction.

This implies the Size-Distance Ratio is strictly greater than one. Next, consider the Size-

11

Border Ratio, which has two terms. Assumption (18) implies the …rst term is greater than
one, while bH < bL implies the second term is greater than one.

Hence, the Size-Border

Ratio is also strictly greater than one. Thus, both factors in the decomposition contribute
to making the Size Export-Near Ratio exceed one.
It is useful to discuss what these ratios look like in two extreme cases. The …rst extreme
case is the Border-Investment-Only Case.

Here, there are no internal distance frictions

within the domestic country (aD = 1) nor within the foreign country (aF = 1), while there
is a friction at the border. Thus, there is frictionless trade to ship internally to the border, a
transactions cost to cross the border, then again frictionless trade within the foreign country.
Typical analyses of exports are implicitly working with this special case. For this extreme
case, the ratios reduce to,
Size-Distance Ratio = 1
bH
bL

Size-Border Ratio =

(

1)

>1

so
Size Export-Near Ratio = Size-Border Ratio.

(24)

(For Border-Investment-Only Case)
Thus, di¤erences across plant size in propensity to export are driven entirely by di¤erences
at the border.
An opposite extreme case is the Distance-Investment-Only Case. This case allows for
there to be a friction at the border (e.g., a tari¤ or physical processing cost, or something
else), but it is not possible to make investments to reduce it. So all …rms from all size classes
have the same border friction bH = bL = 1 + , which we assume is greater than one ( > 0).
In this case, the component ratios are

Size-Distance Ratio =

F =aD
Size-Border Ratio =

(For Distance-Investment-Only Case)

12

(25)

So even in this extreme case where there are no border investments, the Size-Border Ratio
exceeds one.
In the analysis below, we will calculate the Size Export-Near Ratio and its multiplicative
decomposition into the Size-Distance Ratio and the Size-Border Ratio.

The Data

The Census Bureau’s Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), conducted in cooperation with the
U.S. Department of Transportation, is a survey of the shipments originating in manufacturing, wholesale, and mining establishments.

At one extreme, a shipment can include a

rail car (or group of rail cars) or a container or a truckload of a particular commodity. At
another extreme, a shipment can include a half pound medical device sent overnight via
Federal Express. The sample is constructed as follows. First, the Census Bureau selects a
sample of plants to be in the survey, using a particular set of sampling weights. Second, the
plants in the sample in turn select a random sample of their shipments over the course of a
particular week in each quarter of the year. For each shipment in the sample, the origin and
destination is reported, as well as the weight (in pounds), the value, the modes of transport,
and some additional information.
The CFS is taken every …ve years in the same years that the Census of Manufacturing
(CM) is taken. We use the 1997 CFS. It consists of more than 5 million shipments sampled
from 64,000 di¤erent plants. We restrict attention to the manufacturing sector and match
2.7 million CFS shipment records to 30,148 manufacturing establishments in the 1997 CM.
Table 1 presents the basic facts about plant size and distance shipped in the 1997 Manufacturing CFS. The shipment shares are calculated using the dollar value of the shipment
and the sampling weights. The distance measure is the “great circle”or “as the crow ‡ies”
distance between locations.3 The …rst row uses all the plants in the data. Over the entire
sample, the dollar-weighted shipment share going to export destinations equals 0.103. For
domestic destinations, the shares are broken down by distance-shipped categories.

The

shares of shipments going Near (less than 100 miles), Mid-Distance (between 100 and 500
miles), and Far (more than 500 miles), equal 0.261, 0.288, and 0.348, respectively.
The remaining rows of table 1 break the sample up by plant employment size categories.
3
The data also provide an estimate of driving distance beween locations. However, we used the great circle
measure to be consistent with what we do below regarding the distance between plants and the Canadian
and Mexican borders.

13

The …rst thing to note about these shares is the well-known pattern that export shares
increase substantially with plant size. (See Bernard and Jensen (1995).) Going from the
smallest plant size category to the largest, the export share increases by a factor of more
than three, from 0.040 to 0.138.
The second thing to note is that a similar pattern is at work with internal shipments
within the United States. This pattern is the key fact that will be driving our main results
in the ratio analysis. The share shipped to far domestic locations increases substantially with
plant size. The smallest plant size category sends only a share of 0.194 to far destinations.
The largest plant size category ships to this distance at twice this rate (a share equal to
0.338). The last column reports the mean mileage of distance shipped by employment size
category. (For exports, distance shipped only includes the U.S. portion of the shipment’s
journey, as we will further explain.) There is a clear pattern that mean mileage of distance
shipped increases with plant size, equaling 327 miles in the smallest category and rising to
589 miles for the largest.
The analysis in the theory holds distance shipped …xed when comparing internal shipments and exports. So we need account for the shipment distances of exports. Note that
while exports typically go further distances than domestic shipments, it certainly can happen that an export goes a shorter way than a domestic shipment. For example, Windsor,
Ontario, lies right across the Canadian border from Detroit, Michigan.

An export from

Detroit to Windsor might be only 5 miles. In contrast, a shipment from the East Coast to
the West Coast of the United States will travel 3,000 miles.
Each shipment in the CFS has a location code both for origin and destination and a
mileage variable is reported between the origin and the destination. However, for exports,
the destination code that is given is for the port of exit in the United States. Thus, the
reported mileage is not the full mileage to the ultimate destination, rather the mileage for
the internal portion of the journey up to the point of exit. In the 1997 CFS, there is a text
…eld in the data that speci…es the destination country. We process this text …eld to classify
exports into three destinations: Canada, Mexico, and “Rest of the World.”4
We set up the distance structure of analysis as follows. We group distances of 500 miles
and above as being the same and call these distances far.

When we look at exports to

Canada, we use only observations for plants in the United States that are located at least
4

The text …eld is messy. For example, survey respondents sometimes mispell the country name, or report
a Canadian province name as the destination rather than Canada (e.g., "ONTARIO" or "ONT, CAN"). To
select out exports to Canada, we looked in the …eld for various correct and incorrect spellings of Canada and
the provinces. For Mexico, we looked for correct and incorrect spellings of Mexico.

14

500 miles from the Canadian border. Hence, all of these exports must be going at least 500
miles. Analogously, when we look at exports to Mexico, we use only observations for plants
that are at least 500 miles from the Mexican border. So all of these exports are necessarily
going further than 500 miles. Finally, exports to the rest of the world besides Mexico and
Canada go more than 500 miles from all locations in the contiguous United States, so we
use all of the plants in the data for these exports.
Figure 1 divides the contiguous United States into three zones, based on distance to the
Canadian and Mexican borders. We use counties as the underlying geographic unit. The
North Zone are those counties located within 500 miles of the Canadian border.5 The South
Zone consists of all counties within 500 miles of the Mexican border. The Middle Zone lies
in between. The Middle Zone is of particular interest. For any plant located in this zone,
all exports necessarily travel more than 500 miles. For plants in the South Zone, if we throw
out exports to Mexico, then all the remaining exports necessarily travel more than 500 miles.
Analogously, we have this e¤ect for plants in the North Zone when we throw out exports to
Canada.
Table 2 provides some summary statistics by the geographic zones.

The North Zone

contains more than half of the shipment observations in the sample and more than half of
the manufacturing plants in the underlying universe of plants. We note that with our 500
mile cuto¤ distance to Canada, we are using a broad de…nition of “North” that groups all
of Virginia and most of North Carolina and Tennessee into the North Zone. The Middle
and South Zones are similar, in accounting for roughly one-…fth of the manufacturing plants
and employment in the underlying universe, and roughly one-…fth of the sample shipments.
Average plant employment size is 48.7 in the Middle Zone, which is similar to the average
in the North Zone and to the overall mean. Plants are somewhat smaller, on average, in
the South Zone.
We note that we don’t use a higher cuto¤ to de…ne far shipments, as this would cause
us to lose many observations. For example, if we set the cuto¤ to 1,000 miles and require a
location to be more than 1,000 miles from both the Canadian and the Mexican border, then
only six counties at the southeastern tip of Florida would qualify.
5

We use the great circle formula to calculate the distance of each county to each inhabited place in Canada
and take the minimum of these distances. This is e¤ectively the same as minimum distance to the Canadian
border. We do the same thing for Mexico.

Benchmark Results

As explained in the previous section, we group shipment distances further than 500 miles
together as being equivalent, a far shipment. We will also group shipment distances of less
than 100 miles together and call these near shipments. In the ratio analysis, we will treat
near shipments as corresponding to the mileage m = 0 case in the theory.
Table 3 presents shipment shares by destination category and plant size for plants in
di¤erent geographic zones. For example, Panel A reports the shares for plants in the South
Zone (i.e., plants within 500 miles of Mexico). Each panel reports the shipment shares for
near and far domestic locations and far foreign locations.

To ensure that all the foreign

shipments go at least 500 miles, we make certain deletions regarding exports.

For Panel

A, we delete all exports to Mexico, so the statistic reported in the column labeled “Foreign
Far”is the share of all shipments that are exports to countries besides Mexico. That is, all
exports necessarily travel more than 500 miles. We don’t need to make any deletions for the
Middle Zone in Panel B. For the North Zone plants in Panel C, we delete exports to Canada.
Finally, the last panel uses all plants across the three zones. For this, we delete all exports
to Canada and Mexico for all plants, even those in the Middle Zone, to be consistent.
Note that across all four samples of plants, the domestic near share falls sharply with
plant size, while the domestic and foreign far shares both increase sharply with plant size.
Table 4 uses the shares in the various samples of table 3 to construct the ratios de…ned
in the theory for each sample. The Export-Near Ratio is calculated by taking, for each size
class, the ratio of foreign far shipments to domestic near shipments The Distance Ratio is
domestic far sales divided by domestic near sales. The Border Ratio is the ratio of foreign far
to domestic far. The latter holds constant distance, because all shipments in the numerator
and denominator exceed 500 miles (and because we are treating distances above 500 miles
as the same).
The last three columns contain the ratios across plant size categories of the ratios in
the previous three columns.

For each row, we are putting the largest size class in the

numerator and the size class for the given row in the denominator. For example, consider
the 7.14 …gure that is reported in Panel A for the Size Export-Near Ratio for the “1 to 19”
employment size class. To calculate this, we start with the Export-Near Ratio of the “1 to
19” class, which is 0.08. (This value says exports are 8 percent as large as domestic near

16

shipments for the smallest plants.) The 0.08 …gure is put in the denominator. Next, we
take the Export-Near Ratio of the largest employment class, which equals 0.60. The Size
Export-Near Ratio is then 0:60=0:08 = 7:14, which says that plants in the largest size class
are about seven times more likely than plants in the smallest size class to export instead of
shipping to a near domestic location. In the bottom row, we are taking the largest size class
relative to itself, so the size ratios all equal one.
As explained in the theory, the Size Export-Near Ratio can be multiplicatively decomposed into the Size-Distance Ratio and the Size-Border Ratio, where these ratios are given
model interpretations. The Size-Distance Ratio separates out the e¤ect of distance, holding
…xed that the destination is domestic, so the border is held constant. The Size-Border Ratio
holds …xed distance shipped (more than 500 miles), isolating the e¤ect of the border.
Inspection of table 4 reveals two clear patterns.

First, both factors— distance and

border— contribute to making the size export-near ratio be greater than one. This follows
because virtually all the size distance and size border ratios are greater than one.
Second, the size distance ratios are virtually all larger than the size border ratios. In
short, distance is doing more than half the work in accounting for why large plants export
instead of shipping locally, compared with small plants.

For example, consider the Size

Export-Near Ratio equal to 7.14 in the …rst row of Panel A. This can be broken down into
distance and border components, 7:14 = 3:21

2:23, which correspond to the model objects

in (23). Both factors matter, but the distance component is larger.
The results in table 4 make clear that the “Border Investment Only”special case in (24)
where the distance ratio does no work (i.e., it equals one) and the border ratio does all the
work (i.e., the size export-near ratio equals the size border ratio) is substantially at odds
with the data.

In contrast, we cannot rule out the “Distance Investment Only” special

case, because even in this special case with no border investments, the Size-Border Ratio is
greater than one.

4.2

The Role of Industries

Table 4 shows our result is robust in one dimension. We get a similar result across three different populations of plants from di¤erent geographic areas (and is robust when we aggregate
the three populations to create a fourth sample). This subsection considers an alternative
way to examine robustness related to the role of industries.
We expect that industries di¤er systematically and that some industries would tend to
17

have high export shares and large plants. So some of the pattern revealed in table 3 that
large plants tend to have high export shares can be understood as arising from industry
composition.

We can ask: What happens within more narrowly de…ned industries?

We

take two approaches to answering this question.
4.2.1

First Approach: Industry Controls

First, rather than work with the raw data, we consider what happens when we estimate a
linear …xed e¤ects model of the sales distribution and then take …tted values holding industry
e¤ects constant. Speci…cally, consider the following linear model
sji;k =

j
i

+

j
k,

(26)

where sji;k is the share of shipments in destination category j, for plant size class k in
industry i.

This speci…cation decomposes the share into a industry …xed e¤ect

plant-size e¤ect

j
k.

j
i

and a

For example, take j to be shipments in the “Far Foreign”category. If a

particular industry tended to have a high value of exports, …xing plant size, then this industry
would have a high value of

j
i.

For each sample, we estimate (26) using sales revenue as

weights, de…ning industry at the level of six-digit NAICS. (NAICS is the North American
Classi…cation System, and the six-digit level is the …nest level of plant classi…cation. For
the 1997 Census of Manufactures, there are 473 di¤erent six-digit NAICS industries.) Next,
to be the sales weighted average across industries of the estimated ^ ji . We then
j
use our estimate of the plant-size e¤ects ^ k to create a …tted value
we de…ne

j

sjk =

j

j

+ ^k

(27)

for how the shipment shares vary with plant size, for …xed industry.
Table 5 presents the …tted values (27) for the various samples. The …rst thing to note is
that controlling for industry e¤ects signi…cantly damps the relationship between plant size
and exports. For example, in Panel A in the raw data with no industry controls in table
3, the Foreign Far share is 0.040 in the smallest plant size class and rises to 0.152 in the
largest plant size class. In table 5 with the industry controls, the relationship is attenuated,
going from 0.087 to 0.122. Nevertheless, the point remains that even with detailed industry
controls, there is a positive relationship between plant size and exports.

18

We can also see in table 5 that even after the industry controls are included, there still
remains a positive relationship between plant size and the domestic far ratio, though again
it is attenuated, just like the export relationship. For example, in Panel A in the raw data
from Table 3, the domestic far shares go from 0.261 to 0.443; with the industry controls in
table 5, the …tted values go from 0.308 to 0.415.
In the last three columns of table 5, we take the …tted values of the shares and run them
through the same ratio calculations as before. The …rst thing to note is that these ratios
are all smaller and closer to one than their counterparts in table 4. This result is simply a
re‡ection of that fact that the industry controls are dampening the size relationships. The
key take-away point is that size-distance ratios continue to be larger than the size-border
ratios (or if anything, become relatively larger than without the industry controls). Distance
plays the larger role in accounting for what is left after industry e¤ects are taken out.
4.2.2

Second Approach: More Narrow Industries

In our second approach, rather than use the whole set of industries at one time with controls
like we just did, we break things down into more narrow samples of industries.

We still

need to group industries in some way because if we get too narrow we start running out of
shipment observations.

Our strategy is to group industries based on the extent to which

the industry produces a good that is tradable.
We use results from Holmes and Stevens (2010) to group industries. That paper uses
the 1997 Manufacturing CFS to estimate parameters of the Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and
Kortum (2003, hereafter BEJK) model of trade. We estimated the model for 172 di¤erent
manufacturing industries at the six-digit NAICS level. The industries for which we estimated
the model are those with di¤use demand that approximately follows the distribution of
population, such as consumer goods. (The paper provides the details about how the 172
industries were selected, and links to the estimates for each industry.)

For each of these

industries, we obtain an estimate of a “distance adjustment” at any given mileage distance
that is a composite of structural parameters related to the ease of internal trade. The
adjustment is such that a value of 1 corresponds to frictionless trade, and a value of 0
corresponds to the impossibility of trade. De…ne the BEJK Tradability Parameter for each
industry to be the estimated distance adjustment for each industry, evaluated at 100 miles.
For the results we report here, we group industries by quartiles of the BEJK tradability
parameter, with each quartile having 43 industries.

19

The bottom quartile includes very

di¢ cult to trade industries like ready-mix concrete, ice, and asphalt paving. The top quartile
includes industries like jewelry and medical equipment that have high value to weight.
Table 6 presents the ratio analysis for these four di¤erent quartiles of industries.

We

use plants in the Middle Zone; these plants form the cleanest sample, as we can include all
exports. The pattern that we established above continues to hold; the size-distance ratio is
larger than the size-border ratio in virtually every case.

4.3

A Comment about How the Results Understate Distance

We make a …nal comment about how our estimates may understate the role of distance.
Recall that when we compare far shipments within the United States with far shipments to
foreign locations, we are conditioning on shipment distance being longer than 500 miles, and
in that way we are holding distance shipped …xed. However, conditional on a shipment going
more than 500 miles, a foreign shipment likely travels further than a domestic shipment. So
the size border ratio, as we have calculated it, likely includes some component of distance.
That is, the border term is likely overstated, while the distance term is understated. This
point only reinforces our conclusion that the distance component is larger than the border
component.

5

Conclusion

This paper uses the CFS shipment data to demonstrate that, compared with small plants,
large plants are relatively more likely to ship further distances to domestic locations. This
result is analogous to the well-known fact that large plants are more likely to be exporters.
The paper develops a model to interpret the shipment data, deriving a decomposition between the e¤ect of distance itself and the e¤ect of crossing a border for …xed distance. The
main …nding is that more than half of the observed plant-size/export relationship can be
attributed to the e¤ect of distance itself, as opposed to the e¤ect of the border for …xed
distance.
