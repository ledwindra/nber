    "abstract": "\n\nWe use detailed data for Iceland to examine two often-neglected aspects of the \u201cexchange rate pass-through\u201d problem. First, we investigate whether the pass-through coefficient varies with the degree of \u201cinternational tradability\u201d of goods. Second, we analyze if the pass-through coefficient depends on the monetary policy framework. We consider 12 disaggregated price indexes in Iceland for 2003-2019, a period that includes Iceland\u2019s banking and currency crisis of 2008. We find that the pass-through declined around the time Iceland reformed its \u201cflexible inflation targeting,\u201d and that the coefficients are significantly higher for tradable than for nontradable goods.\n\n",
