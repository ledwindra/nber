ABSTRACT
This study examines the relationship between time discounting, other sources of time preference, and
intertemporal choices about smoking. Using a survey fielded for our analysis, we elicit rates of time
discount from choices in financial and health domains. We also examine the relationship between
other determinants of time preference and smoking status. We find very high rates of time discount
in the financial realm for a horizon of one year, irrespective of smoking status. In the health domain,
the implied rates of time discount decline with the length of the time delay (hyperbolic discounting)
and the sign of the payoff (the "sign effect"). We use a series of questions about the willingness to
undergo a colonoscopy to elicit short- and long-run rates of discount in a quasi-hyperbolic discounting
framework, finding no evidence that short-run and long-run rates of discount differ by smoking status.
Using more general measures of time preference, i.e., impulsivity and length of financial planning
horizon, smokers are more impatient. However, neither of these measures is significantly correlated
with the measures of time discounting. Our results indicate that subjective rates of time discount revealed
through committed choice scenarios are not related to differences in smoking behavior. Rather, a combination
of more general measures of time preference and self-control, i.e., impulsivity and financial planning,
are more closely related to the smoking decision.

Introduction
The recent economics literature on anomalies of intertemporal choice and self-

control has been focused on alternatives to the standard assumption of exponential timediscounting. Building on Strotz (1956) and Phelps and Pollak (1968), research by Laibson
(1997) and O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999) sparked a large new literature that explores the
consequences of (quasi)-hyperbolic discounting in many areas, including savings behavior,
labor, environmental, and health economics, and corporate finance. Models of hyperbolic
discounting have often augmented or replaced the insights derived from standard models,
rationalized puzzling behaviors, and generated new testable predictions. Importantly,
certain welfare consequences of government policy have been shown to depend critically
on whether consumers are (quasi-) hyperbolic rather than standard, exponential discounters
(O’Donoghue and Rabin 2005). For example, if agents are hyperbolic discounters, the
welfare benefits of an increased tax on cigarettes may be greatly magnified because
problems of self-control induce net costs of smoking that are internal to the smoker
(Gruber and Köszegi 2001, 2004; Sloan, Ostermann, Picone et al. 2004).
This literature on hyperbolic discounting has grown rapidly, in part, because
experimental evidence of hyperbolic discounting is voluminous. When choosing now to
commit to present or future intertemporal tradeoffs, individuals commonly display
declining (hyperbolic) rates of time discount. As Strotz (1956) first demonstrated, declining
rates of time discount revealed by such committed choices imply time-inconsistency and
problems of self-control when choices are uncommitted. There are, however, other
potential sources of time preference and problems of self-control not reflected in time
discount functions and thus the committed choices of individual decision makers. In

1

models of dual selves (or cognitive processes) and of temptation costs, for example,
present-biased time preference, tastes for commitment, and apparent time-inconsistency
may emerge for reasons unrelated to the time discount function.1 Recent empirical work is
also consistent with the idea that substantially improving models of intertemporal choice
may require more than the proper calibration of the discount function (Bernheim, Skinner,
and Weinberg 2001; Ameriks, Caplin, and Leahy, 2003; Ameriks, Caplin, Leahy, and Tyler
2004).
In this study, using data collected for our research, we examine the relationship
between time discounting, other sources of time preference, and intertemporal choices
about smoking. The decision to smoke represents an interremporal tradeoff with substantial
implications for individual and social welfare, and thus provides a natural context in which
to study these issues. We elicit rates of time discount from choices in both financial and
health domains. We also examine the relationship between other determinants of time
preference and smoking status. Specifically, we employ a proxy for respondents’ degree of
self-control using measures of impulsivity in individual behaviors. We investigate whether
these and other measures of self-control differ by smoking status and to what extent these
measures are correlated with subjective rates of time discount.
Using standard questions regarding committed intertemporal choices in the
financial and health domains, we find patterns consistent with previous research on
subjective rates of time discount. Responses to now standard hypothetical, choice scenarios
reveal very high rates of time discount in the financial realm for a horizon of one year,

(1988) ,Benhabib and Bisin (2005), Loewenstein and O’Donoghue (2005), Fudenberg and Levine
(forthcoming), and Ozdenoren, Salant, and Silverman (2006), on dual self/system models, and Gul and
Pesendorfer (2001) on models of costly self-control.

irrespective of smoking status. Consistent with previous research, we find evidence that
these implied rates of time discount decline with the length of the time delay, (hyperbolic
discounting), and the sign of the payoff (the “sign effect”). We find the effect of size of
stakes on choices for gains but not for losses (the “magnitude effect”). Further, we use a
series of questions about the willingness to undergo a colonoscopy, a procedure
recommended for all persons in the age group of respondents to our survey, irrespective of
smoking status, to elicit short- and long-run rates of discount in a quasi-hyperbolic
discounting framework. We find no evidence that short-run and long-run rates of discount
differ by smoking status.
While several measures of time discounting in our data replicate patterns seen
consistently in the literature, there is no correlation between these measures and smoking
status. Our findings thus indicate that variation in time discounting is not a driving force
behind differences in smoking behavior. However, we find that measures of impulsivity
and length of financial planning horizon are related to smoking decisions. Those who,
according to a composite measure reflecting a tendency for emotional rather than
thoughtful responses to external circumstances, are more impulsive are also significantly
more likely to have or continue to smoke.2 Similarly, current smokers tend to have shorter
financial planning horizons, even conditional on their longevity expectations. Neither of
these measures of planning or self-control is significantly correlated with the standard
measures of time discounting. Although we find that subjective rates of time discount
revealed through committed choice scenarios are unrelated to differences in smoking

This finding is qualitatively consistent with results in experimental psychology which draw on (typically
small) samples of younger people. See, for example, Mitchell (1999) with 20 college-aged smokers and
references contained therein.

behavior, a combination of more general measures of self-control, impulsivity and financial
planning, is related to the smoking decision.
This paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes our data source and
shows how the smokers in these data exhibit many of the characteristics and behaviors
noted previously in the literature. Section III presents our methods and results regarding
subjective rates of time discount in the financial and health domains, and their relationship
to smoking decisions. This section ends with analysis of alternative sources of time
preference--impulsivity and length of planning horizon. Section IV concludes.
II. Data
Our analysis relies on data from the Survey on Smoking (SOS). The SOS was
conducted by the research firm Battelle from October 2004-January 2005 at three sites
where Battelle offices are located, Durham, North Carolina, St. Louis, Missouri, and
Seattle, Washington. There were three interviews: a screener to determine age eligibility
and smoking status administered by telephone; a second longer interview also conducted by
telephone; and an in-person computer-assisted interview. All information used in this paper
came from the screener and the longer telephone interview. Given the study questions, the
SOS is more comprehensive in asking questions about time preference, self control, and
impulsivity than are previous surveys on smoking.
The SOS sample consisted of adults aged 50-70 at the interview date, who were
current, former, or never smokers. At this age, never-smokers are very unlikely to start
(Sloan, Smith, and Taylor 2003). The most relevant decision in this group is therefore
whether to quit smoking. The decision to quit smoking is both common and consequential

4

for health, even at older ages.3 To the extent that traits such as time discounting rates or
degrees of impulsivity are permanent, our analysis also sheds light on the decision to start
smoking.
Since much of the survey dealt with smoking status, current smokers were
oversampled. The analysis sample from the first survey consisted of 663 individuals, 252
current, 257 former, and 154 never smokers. The response rate for the longer telephone
interview was approximately 80%.

The analysis sample from the follow-up survey

consisted of 431 individuals, of whom 149 were current, 165 former, and 117 were never
smokers. The follow-up survey included questions on time discounting in the health
domain, risk preference, and the value of avoiding smoking-related illness.
Descriptive statistics for the sample of persons who responded to both SOS surveys
and the sample of those who only responded to the first survey are shown in Table 1.
Higher proportions of current and former smokers responded to both surveys and a
correspondingly lower proportion of never smokers responded to both. On average, persons
who responded to both surveys had lower educational attainment. Persons who responded
to both surveys also had lower self-reported health on average.
Stylized facts about smokers reported by others (see e.g., Brigham 1998, Sloan,
Smith, and Taylor 2003; Sloan, Ostermann, Picone et al. 2004, Slovic 2001) are also found
in the SOS data (not shown in Table 1), although respondents to the SOS are much older
than respondents to the vast majority of previous surveys on smoking. The mean age at
which individuals begin smoking is 16.7 years. Current smokers consume between 11 and
20 cigarettes a day. Of current smokers, 84.9% said that they had tried quitting in the past.
3

At least 30% of smokers attempt to quit annually (Fiore et al. 1990; Hughes et al. 1992); and even those who
quit smoking at age 65 will gain, on average, 2-3 years in life expectancy (Taylor, Hasselblad, Hensley et al.
2002).

5

The mean age at which they first tried to quit was 37.3 years. On average, they had quit for
more than a month on 1.71 occasions. For persons who were former smokers at the
interview date, the number of quit attempts for longer than a month was 1.98. Among
current smokers, 76.2% said that they would like to quit smoking. Important reasons for
relapses among current smokers who had quit were stress (41.2%), habit or physical
addiction (13.7%), and desire to be social (13.1%). Major factors that led to quitting were
health shocks (44.4%),4 precaution against future health shocks (13.6%), and for family
reasons (11.3%).
These facts indicate that (1) a substantial number of persons quit, (2) many people
try to quit and relapse, (3) a minority of people who have ever smoked have never tried to
quit, and (4) judging from the reasons people give for quitting and relapsing, more is at
work than simple physical addiction. Only 13.7 percent of current smokers report relapsing
because they are physically addicted. Taken together, these patterns of behavior are
consistent with problems of self-control and a taste for commitment.
Indeed, in the SOS, the vast majority of smokers use commitment devices to curb
their smoking, implying that they are aware of a self control problem. The SOS asked, “To
limit my smoking, I buy packs rather than cartons. Do you: disagree strongly, disagree,
disagree somewhat, agree somewhat, agree, and agree strongly?” Twenty-seven percent of
current smokers said that they at least somewhat agreed with the statement that they buy
packs for this reason. The SOS also contained an open-ended question about other
commitment devices smokers. “In no more than a few sentences, could you describe other
strategies you use to limit the amount you smoke?” Eighty-one percent used some type of

Sloan, Smith, and Taylor (2003), using data from the Health and Retirement Study, found that health shocks
were the major determinant of quitting among mature smokers.

self-control device.5 The responses to the open-ended question indicate that almost everyone
claims to use a commitment device of some sort.
The literature on hyperbolic discounting has also been motivated in part by an
observation that people resort to various commitment devices that would not be used by
time-consistent expected utility maximizers. A stylized fact used by Gruber and Köszegi
(2001) to motivate their analysis of smoking decisions is that smokers are unable to carry out
their own plans for levels of future cigarette consumption. Gruber and Köszegi state that
“unrealized intentions to quit at some future date are a common feature of stated smoker
preferences” (p.1279). They provide evidence that, among high school seniors, 56% claimed
that they would quit in five years, but only 31% quit in that time.
Evidence from much older respondents to the SOS is consistent with this finding.
The SOS question was “Roughly how many cigarettes do you expect to smoke per day two
years from now?” Those smokers who said that would be smoking zero cigarettes were
classified as self-assessed quitters. The self-assessed probability of quitting was compared
with actual quit rates computed from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national
longitudinal survey of persons aged over 50.6 The mean subjective probability from SOS of
having quit in two years was 0.41. In the HRS, by comparison, the corresponding, objective

Commitment devices listed other than buying packs rather than cartons: (1) keep busy, keep hands busy, work
out in the yard, do a lot of reading and crossword puzzles, washing dishes and cleaning, talk to someone on the
telephone; (2) stop smoking in the house, go outside, no smoking at work, put myself in places where smoking
is not allowed; (3) keep diary to see when last smoked, limit myself to one cigarette each half an hour, leave
cigarette burning after two puffs, smoke first half of cigarette, do not smoke early in the morning; (4) chew gum
or hard candy, eating, I brush my teeth when I got a big craving for a cigarette, drink water; (5) put cigarettes
out of reach when I am at home, try not to have any in the house, don’t take them with me; (6) patch, medicine;
(7) avoid other smokers.

two-year quit rate was 0.16.7

Like youths, mature smokers thus appear to be overly

optimistic about quitting. This is further evidence that people have difficulty implementing
their plans about intertemporal consumption, at least in the context of smoking.
III. Methods and Results
III. A. Time Discounting in the Financial Domain
Much of the evidence discussed in the previous subsection is qualitatively
consistent with the problems of self-control that would emerge from hyperbolic time
discounting. In this section we begin our direct examination of time discounting with the
responses to intertemporal tradeoffs in the financial domain. The first SOS interview asked
four questions about winning or losing money now versus a year from now. The questions
were worded as “Would you rather win (lose) $x now or $y a year from now?” Values of x
were set at $20 or $1,000, and values of y were $30 and alternatively $1,500. This allowed
us to gauge whether the stakes involved affect the choices. These questions reveal
preferences under commitment, and thus reflect the standard measure of subjective time
discounting.
To evaluate whether rates of time discounting in the financial domain differ by
smoking status and by the amounts at stake, we run regressions of the following form:
di = α + θ* csi + µ* fsi +φ* wi +γ*li +π* vi + εi

(1),

where di is an indicator variable for the less patient choice and equals 1 if the person elects
to receive the money now and or pay the money later and equals 0 otherwise; csi and fsi are
indicator variables for current and former smokers respectively (never smokers are the
omitted group), wi is an indicator variable for the choice of winning $20 now or $30 a year
7

We also estimated probits which included age, marital status, gender, educational attainment, race, and selfrated health status as regressors to correct for differences in sample characteristics between the SOS and HRS.
The results were almost identical to those reported.

8

later, li is an indicator variable for the choice of losing $30 a year later or $20 now, and vi is
an indicator for the choice of losing $1,500 a year later or $1,000 now (choice of winning
$1,000 now versus $1,500 a year later is the omitted group).
We find that 51% of respondents would rather win $1,000 now than $1,500 in a
year (Table 2, col. 1). When the scale of the reward is decreased to $20 now versus $30 a
year from now, 67% of individuals prefer to have the money immediately.

This is

consistent with previous findings on the “magnitude effect;” individuals are more presentoriented when the stakes are small (see e.g., Thaler 1981, Loewenstein 1987, Benzion,
Rapoport, and Yagil 1989).
However, 31% of individuals would prefer to lose $30 a year from now rather than
$20 now. When faced with the choice of losing $1,500 a year from now versus $1,000 now,
38% would prefer to delay their loss. Although these results for losses are inconsistent with
the magnitude effect, when compared with those concerning financial gains these findings
are consistent with previous research showing the “sign effect” (see e.g., Thaler 1981;
Benzion, Rapoport, and Yagil 1989); people generally prefer to postpone losses, but reveal
smaller rates of time discount when the tradeoff is between losses rather than gains.
Importantly, the coefficients on smoking status indicate no difference in financial tradeoffs
by smoking status.
We repeat the analysis separately for each of the smoking groups, and find that the
parameters are very similar among the groups (Table 2, cols. 2-4). We conclude that (1)
there is evidence for both the sign and magnitude effects found previously in the literature
but, (2) time discounting as measured by these financial tradeoff questions does not differ
by smoking status.

9

II. B. Time Discounting in the Health Domain
In this section, we investigate the relationship between time discounting and the
decision to smoke using questions about the health domain.We do this in the health domain
as it is plausibly the appropriate domain to examine time discounting for health-related
intertemporal choices such as smoking.8
III. B.1. Healthy Days
To measure time discounting in the health domain we use responses to the
following questions from the second (the in-person) SOS interview. Responses were
elicited to the following statement: “20 extra days in perfect health this year would be just
as good as ____ extra days in perfect health x year(s) from now” where x is alternatively 1,
5, 10, and 20 and n is the number of extra health days. Assuming exponential time
discounting, where ρ is the rate of time preference, if the individual is indifferent between
n extra healthy days at time x, and 20 extra healthy days this year, then e-[ρt]*U(20) = e[ρ(t+x)]

*U(n), which implies that ρ = [ln(U(n))- ln(U(20))]/x.
We assume that utility is linear with respect to these extra days of health, pool all

responses to all questions and run regressions of the following form:
ρ i = α + θ* csi + µ* fsi +φ* t5i + γ *t10i + π* t20i + εi

(2),

where t5i, t10i ,and t20i are indicator variables for the relevant comparison years and
number of extra days a year from now is the omitted group.
When the time horizon involves a comparison of equivalence of 20 healthy days
this year versus healthy days a year from now, for never smokers, ρ is estimated to be 0.5

8

The questions do not, however, refer to smoking versus health tradeoffs per se. Such tradeoffs would more
likely depend directly on smoking behavior and thus capture less well an underlying tendency toward
(im)patience in the health domain.

10

(Table 3, col. 1). The implied discount rate is extremely large, which is similar to our
finding for financial discount rates based on a horizon of one year (see Table 1). However,
when the comparison is extra healthy days in five, 10, and 20 years from now versus 20
extra healthy days this year, the estimate of ρ decreases to 0.14, 0.08, and 0.05,
respectively. Thus the implied rate of time discount declines sharply as the tradeoff is
pushed futher into the future. We find no differences by smoking status. In columns 3-5, we
stratify by smoking status and find results that are qualitatively similar to the pooled
findings.9
In sum, our analysis reveals that health discount rates fall dramatically with the
length of the time horizon, a pattern that is consistent with hyperbolic discounting.
However, this finding is, as argued by Read (2001, 2003), observationally equivalent to
subadditive discounting. In computing a discount rate, with additive discounting, the
discount rate one would calculate over a delay, the time at which the choice is made the
time at the outcome is realized, is independent over the number of intervals in the delay
over which the discount rate is calculated. An interval is the difference in time between two
outcomes for which there is an intertemporal tradeoff. With subadditive discounting, the
total discount rate over the delay becomes larger as the number of intervals is increased.10
Our finding that time discounting decreases with increases in the delay, which is
common in the previous literature, is based on questions that confound delay and the
interval. In our analysis, the delay is the time difference between this year and some distant
year, e.g., five, 10, or 20 years whereas by the nature of the questions, this coincides with
the interval since the tradeoff is between healthy days this year and the distant year. To
9

The exception is that the point estimates indicate that former smokers have lower short-term rates of time
discount than do either current or never smokers. These differences are not, however, statistically significant.
10
For details, see Read (2003).

11

disentangle these two effects, it is sufficient to keep constant the interval between the two
choices while varying period between the present and when the later outcome is to be
realized. The questions used in this part of the analysis follow conventions of the literature
and are subject to Read’s critique. Hence, as described in the following section, the SOS
asked another set of questions to measure time discounting that are not subject to this
critique.
III. B.2. Months of Life Extention from Colonoscopy
Quasi-hyperbolic time discounting has been proposed as a potential explanation
for continued smoking (Gruber and Köszegi 2001). In this subsection, we seek direct
evidence of short- and long-run discount factors and examine whether or not these differ by
smoking status.
We again use a survey-based approach for estimating the short- and long-run
discount factors. The second interview of the SOS contained a series question about the
longevity benefit needed at different points in time for the respondent to be willing to
undergo a colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is a procedure to screen and prevent colon cancer and
requires uncomfortable preparations. Although unpleasant and time consuming, the
procedure is highly accurate in detecting polyps or tumors in the colon and is recommended
for persons in the SOS age cohort, irrespective of smoking status (Singh, Turner, Xue et al.
2006). The procedure involves a substantial cost in time and unpleasantness but offers a
potentially large benefit in terms of increased longevity. These characteristics make
questions about a colonoscopy a good instrument for eliciting rates of time discounting
from nonsmokers and smokers alike in the health domain. After presenting a description of
the procedure and the required preparation, the SOS asked respondents to rate on a scale

12

from 0 to 10 the degree of discomfort associated with the procedure, based on the
description they just heard. Since the vast majority of persons are likely to have had
insurance for this procedure, time and discomfort involved are plausibly the major costs to
individuals of having a colonoscopy. There were no statistically significant differences in
the mean rating of discomfort between current and never and former and never smokers.
We elicit discount rates using responses to intertemporal choices about willingness
to undergo colonoscopy. The SOS asked three questions about the payoff in terms of added
life expectancy required for the individual to choose to get a colonoscopy. Before asking
the questions, respondents were instructed in what having a colonoscopy entails.11
Assuming a finite lifespan consisting of periods indexed by t. For each individual i
at time t, the SOS elicited the individual’s subjective life expectancy (Nit). The first
colonoscopy question sought to determine the number of months of added life expectancy
(X1i) needed to induce the person to get a colonoscopy now.12 For individual i, let ci be the

11

This is the text explaining to respondents what a colonoscopy entails. This explanation was provided before
the sequence of questions about willingness to undergo this procedure were asked.
“People differ in how they think about the value of preventive care. The following items are about a preventive
test that many people receive after the age of 50. The procedure is called a colonoscopy.
o The colon is the large intestine. This procedure is the best method for screening patients for colon cancer.
By preventing colon cancer, life can often be extended as some of the disability and discomfort from the
disease can often be avoided. Before the doctor begins the procedure, the patient is given anesthesia to
reduce discomfort from the procedure. Because the patient may be sleepy afterwards, it is necessary for
someone to drive the patient to the clinic where the procedure is done.
o A colonoscope, a long flexible tubular instrument, is inserted into the rectum. The other end of the scope
has video visualization enabling the physician to directly inspect the lining of the colon. Other instruments,
such as biopsy forceps, can be passed through the colonoscope to perform certain surgical procedures.
Before the procedure:
o Colonoscopy can be performed in either hospitals or outpatient surgical centers. It is very important to
follow the instructions carefully because the colon must be completely clean for a successful test.
o The patient is asked not to eat or drink anything for at least 8 hours before the colonoscopy. A clear liquid
diet is required the day before the exam.
The patient also takes a liquid bowel stimulant the day before the procedure to cleanse out the colon.”

12

Question 1 was phrased as: “Suppose you were told that by having the colonoscopy, you could extend your
life expectancy from (N to N+ X1). Would you have the colonoscopy now?” The starting value for X1 was
randomly drawn from 6 months to 5 years; iterations continued until the person chose to have a colonoscopy.

13

instantaneous disutility of having a colonoscopy, and Vi(Nit – t) be the utility of the
anticipated remaining years of life at t. If the annual rate of time discount is γ + ρ in the
first year, and ρ in the subsequent years, then if the individual is indifferent between
having a colonoscopy and receiving X1i additional years of life, we get an indifference
equation of the following form:
Vi(Nit – t) = ci + Vi(Nit – t) + e -γ i - ρi (Nit - t) αi X1i ,
where the additional months of life required to achieve this indifference (X1i) arrive at the
end of the expected life time and are therefore discounted by e -γ i - ρi (Nit -t) . The parameter αi is
the individual-specific, time invariant value of an extra month of life. This indifference
equation implies that
ci = e -γ i - ρi (Nit -t) αi X1i

(3).

A second question asked the extra months of life expectancy needed for the person
to be willing to have a colonoscopy a year from now (X2i) keeping the longevity
expectations the same. Responses to this question imply a second indifference equation of
the form:
Vi(Nit – t) = e -γ i - ρi ci + Vi(Nit – t) + e -γ i - ρi (Nit - t) αi X2i .

7.3 percent of responses were left-censored at 6 months and 0.3 percent of responses were right-censored at 5
years. We assume values at these limits in cases in which persons gave left- or right-censored values.
The second question was phrased as: “Suppose you were told that by having the colonoscopy a year from
now, you could extend your life expectancy from (N to N+ X2) years, would you be willing to have the
procedure a year from now?” The SOS followed the same rules for picking starting values and determining
values for the censored observations as in Question 1. 7.7 percent of values were left- and 0.7 percent of values
were right-censored.
The third question was phrased as: “Now suppose that your life expectancy was (N+1), that is, your life
expectancy was extended by a year from the life expectancy you gave me earlier, and suppose you were told
that by having a colonoscopy a year from now, you could extend your life expectancy from (N+1 to N+1+X3)
years, would you be willing to have the procedure a year from now?” The SOS followed the same rules for
picking starting values and determining values for the censored observations as in Question 1. 11.0 percent of
values were left- and 0.8 percent of values were right-censored.

14

The cost of a colonoscopy is unchanged but is discounted since the colonoscopy is delayed
by a year. The second indifference equation implies
e - ρ i ci = e - ρi (Nit - t) αi X2i

(4).

Equations (3) and (4) yield
e - ρi (N it - t) αi X2i = e -γ i - ρi (N it - t +1) αi X1i ,

or (ln(X1i /X2i) = γ i + ρ i .
The SOS included a third question that delayed the benefits from the colonoscopy.
This question added a year to the individual’s subjective life expectancy (Nit+12), and then
asked what the added months of life expectancy would have to be for the person to get a
colonoscopy a year from now (X3i). Responses to this question imply an indifference
equation of the following form:
Vi(Nit – t) + e -γ i - ρi (Nit -t) αi*12 = e -γ i - ρi ci + Vi(Nit – t) + e -γ i - ρi (Nit -t) αi*12 + e -γ i - ρi (Nit - t +1) αi X3i,,
where the arrival of the extra 12 months of longevity is postponed to the end of the
person’s life and the extra months are made available to the individual even if the person
refuses to have a colonoscopy. This indifference equation implies
e - ρ i ci = e - ρi (N it - t +1) αi X3i

(5).

Equations (4) and (5) yield
e - ρi (Nit - t +1) αi X3i = e - ρi (N it - t) αi X2i,

or ln(X3i /X2i) = ρ i . Hence, ln(X1i /X3i)= γ i .
We use the recovered values of ρ and γ

to determine whether or not there is

hyperbolic discounting and whether or not there are differences in discounting by smoking
status.

15

As a preliminary step, we run regressions with the dependent variable being the
months needed to be willing to get a colonoscopy of the form:
Xi = α + θ* csi + µ* fsi +φ* Q1i +γ*Q3i +εi

(6),

where the dependent variable Xi is the response to questions 1, 2, or 3, and Q1i (Q3i) is an
indicator variable for question 1 (3); the omitted category is question 2.
Never smokers require an additional 13.25 months to their life expectancy on
average to undergo a colonoscopy now (Table 4, col. 1).13 To have a colonoscopy a year
from now, such persons require 1.02 months less additional life expectancy. When
individuals are queried about getting a colonoscopy a year from now assuming their life
expectancy is also increased by a year, then such persons require 1.36 months less than if
they were to have the colonoscopy now.
Our mean estimate of the extra months of longevity people require to have a
colonscopy exceed estimates of the objective longevity return to the procedure (Lin,
Kozarek, Schembre et al. 2006). For person of mean age in the SOS sample, the mean life
extension from having a colonoscopy is 7.6 months.14 This gap should be viewed in light of
the fact that the most recent published results appeared two years after the SOS was
conducted. Also, the SOS elicited the asking price, which given that many persons in this
age group do not get colonoscopies, should be higher on average than the objective amount
13

The SOS allowed responses to the colonoscopy questions to vary from 6 months to 59 months. As a result,
7.3 percent of the observations to question 1 were left-censored and 0.3 percent were right-censored. We used
the mid-point between 0 and 6 months for the left-censored observations and an equal number of extra months
for the right-censored observations. For question 2, 7.7 percent of observations were left-censored, and none
were right-censored. For question 3, 11.0 percent of observations were left- and 0.8 percent were rightcensored. To gauge the sensitivity of our findings to assumptions made about the value used for right-censoring,
we substituted a value of 75 months for the value of 62.25 months used in the main calculations. There was
virtually no change in the results.
14
According to Lin, Kozarek, Schembre et al. (2006), mean life extension from having a colonoscopy was 0.85
years for 50-54 year olds and 0.17 for 75-79 year olds. Using linear interpolation to compute the decline in
expected life extension for each additional year of life yields 0.63 years for a person aged 60. Converting 0.63
years into months yields the estimate reported in the text.

16

of life extension. In view of these considerations, the stated asking prices obtained from
SOS respondents are overall quite reasonable. Our finding that fewer months are required
to induce a colonoscopy if performed a year from now is consistent with discounting, either
exponential or hyperbolic. However, compared to responses from the second question,
delaying benefits by a year in the third question should have led to more rather than fewer
months being required to have a colonoscopy. Although the difference is 0.36 of a month,
the difference is in the wrong direction. We speculate that this disprepancy may reflect
non-linear utility for longevity (or decreasing marginal utility of a lifeyear). Importantly,
there are no statistically significant differences by smoking status just as for the analysis of
the financial tradeoff and extra healthy days questions reported above.
To obtain estimates of γ + ρ and ρ , we estimate two regressions together of the
following form:
ln(X1i /X2i) = α + θ* csi + µ* fsi +φ* ri +εi

(7a)

ln(X3i /X2i) = α + θ* csi + µ* fsi +φ* ri +εi

(7b),

and

where X1i , X2i, and X3i are responses to the first, second, and third colonoscopy questions,
respectively, and ri is an indicator with the value zero if the dependent variable is from (7a)
and the value one if the dependent various is from (7b).
The estimate of the sum of the parameters γ + ρ for never smokers, the omitted
group, is negative but statistically insignificant as is the estimate of ρ (Table 5, col. 1),
implying that the discount factors are not statistically different from one. There are no
statistically significant differences by smoking status. In column 2, which is based on the
sample of current smokers, the estimate of γ + ρ is 0.073 and the estimate of ρ is -0.077,

17

implying that γ

for current smokers is about 0.14. Both parameter estimates are not

statistically significant from zero, as in column 1. In column 3, for former smokers, γ + ρ is
-0.030 and the estimate of ρ is -0.044, implying that γ

for current smokers is slightly

positive. However, these estimates also are not statistically significant. Finally, in column
4, for never smokers, γ + ρ is -0.083 and the estimate of ρ is 0.074, implying that γ

for

current smokers is negative, which is opposite of the pattern of current smokers. Since
these too are insignificant, we do not attach great importance to these differences in
parameter estimates. The reason why our point estimates of γ + ρ are negative in column 1
is that respondents required fewer months for a colonoscopy when the benefits were
delayed by a year in the third question. Importantly, a pattern consistent with the responses
to questions discussed above is that there are no statistically significant differences by
smoking status.
To our knowledge, the SOS is the first attempt to elicit short- and long-run rates of
time preference this way. Overall, the estimated additional years of life required to be
willing to obtain a colonoscopy are within a plausible range. Fewer than 10 percent of
responses were either left- or right censored. However, the questions became increasing
mentally taxing (especially the third question). While the approach is promising, we make
two suggestions for future research. First, respondents should be given a few practice
questions (perhaps in the financial domain) to learn how to respond to the time discounting
concepts in the context of a structured survey. Second, the survey should account for the
possibility that the marginal utility of a life year may decline as longevity is extended.
III. C. Alternative Sources of Time Preferences
III. C. 1. Planning

18

Thus far, we have assessed differences in time discounting. We now investigate a
more general framework which allows other psychological motives to enter in
intertemporal decisions. We begin with an examination of the financial planning horizon.
The length of the planning horizon should capture longevity expectations, but also other
factors such as planning ability or more general problems of self control (Ameriks, Caplan,
and Leahy 2003). The SOS telephone interview asked respondents “In planning your
savings and spending, which of the following time periods is most important to you and
your household?” Choices available to respondents were: “the next few months, the next
year, the next few years, the next 5-10 years, longer than 10 years.”
We estimated an equation of the following form:
zi = α + θ* csi + µ* fsi +φ*pi + γ *Ai + εi

(8),

where zi is the length in years of the person’s planning horizon, pi is the individual’s
subjective probablity of surviving to age 75, and Ai is the person’s age. Together, pi and Ai
measure the person’s expected longevity, which would influence the person’s planning
horizon. We convert responses to questions for discrete planning horizon categories to a
continuous measure in years as follows: < year = 0.5 year; next year = 1 year; next few
years = 2.5 years; next 5-10 years = 7.5 years; and longer than 10 years = 20 years. Since
the final category was open-ended, in an alternative specification, we replace 20 with 10
years to examine robustness of our findings to our assumption about the mean value of the
response category.
Without controlling for other factors, current smokers have shorter financial
planning horizons, irrespective of the value assigned to the open-ended category (Table 6,
cols. 1 and 3). Using a 20-year value (10-year value) for the open-ended category, current

19

smokers on average have a financial planning horizon which is 1.7 years (1.2 years) less
than for never smokers. Planning horizons of former smokers do not differ from those of
never smokers. The observed difference between current and never smokers is reduced to
1.2 years (0.9) when we control for age and the subjective probability of living to age 75.15
Thus, some but not all of the observed difference between current and never smokers in
financial horizon is due to the individuals’ subjective beliefs about longevity.
In sum, current smokers have a shorter financial planning horizon than never
smokers. This suggests that smokers are more present-oriented in ways not captured by the
above analysis of time discounting. The questions regarding financial planning horizons
seem to reflect determinants of time preference that are independent of both time
discounting and longevity expectations. Hence, in the next section, we explore differences
by smoking status with a still more general measure of time preference.
III. C. 2. Impulsivity
In this subsection, we measure a still more general source of time preference and
relate it to the smoking decision. We use impulsivity as a measure of an individual’s ability
to set goals and to exercise self-control. The telephone interview of SOS recovered
impulsivity using a series of 14 statements, such as “I make hasty decisions,” I do not
control my temper,” and “I act on impulse.”16 Respondents were asked whether they
“disagree strongly,” “disagree,” “neither disagree nor agree,” “agree,” or “strongly agree”
with each of these statements. The actual wording of the questions varied so that “strongly
agree” sometimes implied high self-control and low impulsivity and sometimes implied the

15

We also use ordered probit analysis, which does not require an assumption about the value of the open-ended
category. The results are qualitatively the same as those reported.
16

20

opposite. In our analysis, we convert the answers to a consistent form in which “strongly
agree” always implies high impulsivity and low self-control.
We create an index of impulsivity and self-control by converting the responses to a
five-point scale with “disagree strongly” =1 and “agree strongly” =5 and summing the
scores for individual items.17 The index varies from 14 to 70 with higher values implying
greater impulsivity. In Fig. 1, which shows the distribution of scores by smoking status,
proportionally more current smokers than others have scores of 40 and above.
To examine differences in the index by smoking status, we estimate an equation
regression of the form
bi = α + θ* csi + µ* fsi +Φ΄* Hi + εi

(9),

where bi is the index defined above an indicator variable equal to 1 if the person elects to
receive or pay the money now and is 0 otherwise, Hi is a vector of demographic
characteristics.
On average, never smokers have an index of 33.9 (Table 7, col. 1). Current smokers
on average have an index which is 2.1 points higher. For former smokers, the index is 2.2
points higher. These means are quite tightly estimated and, thus, both current and former
smokers are significantly more impulsive than never smokers.
Controlling for years of education, gender, race, and age, the index for never
smokers rises to 34.7. The difference for current smokers is 1.5 and former smokers is 1.7.
Education makes people less impulsive; males tend to be more impulsive on average. As
with financial planning, smokers tend to be more impulsive which is a more general

Specific items are listed in Appendix Table 1. This table also presents difference in means and in distributions
by smoking status for each of the items in our impulsivity index.

21

measure of time preference. This result is robust to controls for important demographic
characteristics.
Our results thus indicate that there is not much difference in time discounting by
smoking status, but there are differences in measures of time preference related to financial
planning and other measures of self-control as reflected in our index of impulsivity. Within
domains, measures of time discounting are positively correlated, but not across financial
and health domains (Table 8). Financial planning horizon is positively correlated with
financial discounting. There is a negative correlation between financial planning horizon
and the impulsivity index, suggesting that financial planning reflects both time discounting
and other elements of time preference.
IV. Conclusion
Based on data from a survey fielded for our research, our key finding is that there
are no significant differences in time discounting by smoking status. While our results
replicate various patterns in time discounting that have been used to explain time
inconsistency in intertemporal decision making--in particular, declining rates of time
discounting as the time period is extended, the average time discount function of smokers is
not different from that of non-smokers. Differences in smoking behavior late in life,
therefore seem likely to reflect factors other than time discounting.18
Subtler patterns reported previously in the literature on time discounting also
appeared in our data: the measured rates of time discount reflected a dependence on
18

With the exception of Becker and Mulligan (1997) most work treats time discounting as a primitive of an
economic model. We follow that convention here. Reynolds (2006) uses a sample of 15 smokers and 15 nonsmokers who were on average in their early 30s and finds that the smokers discount delay at a higher rate.
Bickel, Odum, and Madden (1999), using a sample of 23 current, 21 former smokers, and 22 never smokers
which on average had mean ages in the early 30s found that current smokers had higher discount rates than did
former or never smokers. There were no differences in discounting between former and never smokers.
Although this result conflicts with ours, they did find that current smokers were relatively impulsive, a
qualitatively similar result to ours.

22

magnitude, sign and domain that the previous literature has also noted. Our respondents
demonstrated considerable over-optimism about quitting rates and substantial reliance on
commitment devices. In this sense, much of our evidence is consistent with hyperbolic
discounting. Nevertheless, we find little evidence that differences in rates of time discount
are importantly related to differences in smoking decisions. Our findings are in contrast to
those of a seminal study (Fuchs 1982), which examined associations between financial
rates of time preference and smoking. Our results suggest that it is inappropriate to proxy
time preference with measures of smoking behavior.
However, time discounting, as revealed by the intertemporal tradeoffs made by
committed consumers, is just one potential determinant of time preference revealed by
uncommitted choices. The intertemporal tradeoffs represented by actual smoking decisions,
the tastes for commitment revealed by smokers and their over-optimism about quitting all
may emerge through many channels. Even though variations in time discounting do not
appear to be a primary force behind differences in smoking decisions, measures that reflect
self-control and other psychological processes are better correlated with the smoking
decision. Both a measure of impulsivity and of financial time horizon (net of longevity
expectations) are related to smoking decisions. Those who are more impulsive and plan less
for the future are more likely to smoke. In this way, our findings suggest that problems of
self control in intertemporal choices may not be well captured by time-varying rates of time
discount.
Our findings thus provide further motivation for models that “open the black box”
of time preference to model and investigate the behavioral implications of alternative
psychological processes. Rather than identifying smoking simply with higher rates of time

23

discount or more present-biased time discounting, our results indicate that smoking may be
a marker for greater problems of self-control that emerge through other channels.
Specifically, the relative strength of the relationship between measures of impulsivity,
planning horizons and smoking decisions points toward a growing literature that models
ideas such as costly-self control, dual selves and decision processes, and cue-theories of
consumption. Our findings indicate that, in the smoking domain, the predictions of such
modeling may prove a useful complement to research on alternatives to the standard
exponential discount function.
