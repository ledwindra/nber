    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explores several issues concerning a possible zero lower bound (ZLB) including its theoretical rationale; the magnitude of effects of low sustained inflation on real interest rates; the validity of analyzing monetary policy in models with no monetary variables; and the dynamic stabilizing properties of Taylor rules in a ZLB context.  The  most important argument, however, is that if the short nominal rate is immobilized at zero, there nevertheless exists a route for monetary stabilization policy to be effective--- via the foreign exchange market. Its quantitative importance is examined in a calibrated, optimizing, open-economy model.\n\n",
