Understanding Earnings Dynamics: Identifying and Estimating the Changing Roles of Unobserved
Ability, Permanent and Transitory Shocks

JEL No. C14,C23,J31
ABSTRACT
We consider a general framework to study the evolution of wage and earnings residuals that incorporates
features highlighted by two influential but distinct literatures in economics: (i) unobserved skills with
changing non-linear pricing functions and (ii) idiosyncratic shocks with both permanent and transitory
components.
We first provide nonparametric identification conditions for the distribution of unobserved skills, all
unobserved skill pricing functions, and (nearly) all distributions for both permanent and MA(q) transitory
shocks. We then discuss identification and estimation using a moment-based approach, restricting
unobserved skill pricing functions to be polynomials. Using data on log earnings for men ages 30-59
in the PSID, we estimate the evolution of unobserved skill pricing functions and the distributions of
unobserved skills, transitory, and permanent shocks from 1970 to 2008. We highlight five main findings:
(i) The returns to unobserved skill rose over the 1970s and early 1980s, fell over the late 1980s and
early 1990s, and then remained quite stable through the end of our sample period. Since the mid-1990s,
we observe some evidence of polarization: the returns to unobserved skill declined at the bottom of
the distribution while they remained relatively constant over the top half. (ii) The variance of unobserved
skill changed very little across most cohorts in our sample (those born between 1925 and 1955). (iii)
The variance of transitory shocks jumped up considerably in the early 1980s but shows little long-run
trend otherwise over the more than thirty year period we study. (iv) The variance of permanent shocks
declined very slightly over the 1970s, then rose systematically through the end of our sample by 15
to 20 log points. The increase in this variance over the 1980s and 1990s was strongest for workers
with low unobserved ability. (v) In most years, the distribution of unobserved skill pricing is positively
skewed, while the distributions of permanent and (especially) transitory shocks are negatively skewed.

Introduction
Sustained growth in economic inequality over the past few decades (most notably in the U.S. but

also in many other developed countries) has generated widespread interest in both its causes and
consequences, spurring large bodies of research in labor economics, macroeconomics, and growth
economics.1 Perhaps, the greatest efforts have been devoted to understanding the role of skills,
observed and unobserved, in accounting for the evolution of wage and earnings inequality. There
is widespread agreement that the returns to observable measures of skill like education and labor
market experience have increased dramatically since the early 1980s (Card, 1999; Katz and Autor,
1999; Heckman, Lochner, and Todd, 2006, 2008). There is greater disagreement about the evolution
of returns to unobserved abilities and skills (e.g., see Card and DiNardo (2002); Lemieux (2006);
Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008)).2 More generally, the literature has yet to reach a consensus on
the factors underlying changes in residual wage and earnings inequality (i.e. inequality conditional
on observable measures of skill like educational attainment and age/experience).
Figure 1 shows that the evolution of total inequality in log weekly wages and earnings for 30-59
year-old American men is closely mirrored by the evolution of residual inequality, and while the
variance of log earnings is always greater than that for weekly wages, both sets of variances follow
nearly identical time patterns.3 This paper focuses on the evolution of residual earnings inequality
in the U.S. from 1970 to 2008.
Two large and influential empirical literatures study the rise in residual inequality through very
different lenses. Beginning with Katz and Murphy (1992) and Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993), a
literature based primarily on data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) has equated changes
in residual inequality with changes in returns to unobserved abilities or skills.4 According to this
literature, the increase in residual inequality beginning in the early 1980s reflects an increase in the
value of unobserved skill in the labor market.5 This interpretation has fostered the development
1

For example, see surveys by Katz and Autor (1999), Acemoglu (2002), and Aghion (2002).
Taber (2001) argues that increasing returns to unobserved skill in recent decades may be the main driver for
the increase in measured returns to college, since individuals with higher unobserved skills are more likely to attend
college.

Residuals are based on year-specific regressions of log earnings on age, education, race and their interactions. See
Section 4 for a detailed description of the residual regressions and sample used in creating this figure.
4
More recently, see Card and DiNardo (2002); Lemieux (2006); Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008). In a complementary literature, Heckman and Vytlacil (2001) and Murnane, Willett, and Levy (1995) directly estimate the
changing effects of cognitive ability on wages over the 1980s and early 1990s using observable test scores.
5
Lemieux (2006) argues that the composition of unobserved ‘skills’ has also changed over time as baby boomers
have aged and the population has become more educated. Below, we explore differences in the distribution of
unobserved ability across cohorts. Chay and Lee (2000) distinguish between changes in unobserved skill pricing
and changes in the variance of transitory shocks over the 1980s by assuming that blacks and whites have different
unobserved skill distributions but identical (time-varying) variances in transitory shocks.

of new theories of skill-biased technical change as explanations for the increase in demand for skill
(Acemoglu, 1999; Caselli, 1999; Galor and Moav, 2000; Gould, Moav, and Weinberg, 2001; Violante,
2002). Other studies have emphasized institutional changes like the declining minimum wage or
de-unionization as causes for the declining wages paid to low-skilled workers (Card and DiNardo,
2002; Lemieux, 2006). Most recently, Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003), Acemoglu and Autor
(2011) and Autor and Dorn (2012) offer a more nuanced view of technological change, arguing
that the mechanization of many routine tasks in recent decades has led to polarization in both
employment and wages by skill.
A second, equally important literature studies the evolution of residual inequality with the aim of
quantifying the relative importance of transitory and permanent shocks over time (Gottschalk and
Moffitt, 1994; Blundell and Preston, 1998; Haider, 2001; Moffitt and Gottschalk, 2002; Meghir and
Pistaferri, 2004; Gottschalk and Moffitt, 2009; Bonhomme and Robin, 2010; Heathcote, Storesletten,
and Violante, 2010; Heathcote, Perri, and Violante, 2010; Moffitt and Gottschalk, 2012).6 These
studies examine the same type of wage or earnings residuals of the CPS-based literature, only
6

A large related literature estimates earnings dynamics over the lifecycle without attempting to explain changes
in residual inequality over time. See, e.g., Lillard and Weiss (1979); MaCurdy (1982); Abowd and Card (1989); Baker
(1997); Guvenen (2007); Hryshko (2012).

they decompose the residuals into different idiosyncratic stochastic shocks (typically, permanent
martingale shocks, autoregressive and/or moving average processes), estimating the variances of
these shocks over time. Decompositions of this type are of economic interest, because the persistence
of income shocks has important implications for lifetime inequality as well as consumption and
savings behavior at the individual and aggregate levels.7 Studies using the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID) typically find that growth in the variance of transitory shocks accounts for about
one-third to one-half of the increase in total residual variance in the U.S. since the early 1970s. As
Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994) point out, this growth in the variance of transitory shocks suggests
that changes in the pricing of unobserved skills are unlikely to fully account for the observed
rise in residual inequality. While this literature considers a rich structure for stochastic shocks,
it typically neglects potential changes in the pricing of unobserved skills as emphasized by the
CPS-based literature.8
In this paper, we consider a general framework for wage and earnings residuals that incorporates
the features highlighted by both of these literatures: (i) unobserved skills with changing nonlinear pricing functions and (ii) idiosyncratic shocks that follow a rich stochastic process including
permanent and transitory components. Specifically, we consider log wage and earnings residuals
for individual i in period t of the form:9
Wi,t = µt (θi ) + εi,t ,

(1)

where θi represents an unobserved permanent ability or skill, µt (·) a pricing function for unobserved
skills, and εi,t idiosyncratic shocks. We allow for a rich stochastic process for εi,t as in much of the
literature on earnings dynamics and assume that εi,t is mean independent of θi .
Economic shifts in the demand for or supply of unobserved skills are likely to be reflected in
µt (·). To the extent that unobserved skills are important, the wages and earnings of workers at
similar points in the wage distribution should co-move over time as the labor market rewards their
skill set more or less. The recent literature on ‘polarization’ in the U.S. labor market (Autor, Levy,
and Murnane, 2003; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; Autor and Dorn, 2012) suggests that these skill
7

The co-movement of consumption with permanent and transitory income shocks is also of interest to economists
studying the structure of capital/insurance markets (Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston, 2008; Krueger and Perri, 2006).
8
Haider (2001) and Moffitt and Gottschalk (2012) are notable exceptions.
9
This specification is consistent with wage/earnings functions that are multiplicatively separable in observable
factors (like education and experience), unobserved skills, and idiosyncratic wage/earnings shocks. More generally,
observed and unobserved skills may be non-separable in wage or earnings functions. For example, in the case of fixed
observable differences Xi (e.g. cohort of birth, race/ethnicity, or educational attainment prior to labor market entry),
we could write µt (θi , Xi ) where the distribution of i,t may depend on Xi . Our theoretical and empirical analyses
below could all be conditioned on Xi in this case.

4

pricing functions have become more convex in recent years, rewarding skill more and more at the
top of the distribution but not at the bottom. This motivates our emphasis on flexible non-linear
µt (·) pricing functions.
Permanent and transitory shocks embodied in εi,t are idiosyncratic and unrelated across workers
regardless of how close they may be within the skill distribution. We consider a process for εi,t
that is general enough to account for permanent shocks that produce lasting changes in a worker’s
earnings (e.g. job displacement, moving from a low- to high-paying firm, or a permanent disability)
as well as those more short-term in nature (e.g. temporary illness, family disruption, or a good/bad
year for the worker’s employer).10 In our analysis, the sizeable increase in the variance of wages
across firms (within industries and geographic regions) documented by Dunne et al. (2004) and
Barth et al. (2011) is likely to manifest itself in a rise in the variance of permanent shocks, since
most workers switch firms over the lifecycle but switches are infrequent. For similar reasons, any
increase in the variance of wages due to increased occupational switching over time (Kambourov
and Manovskii, 2009) is also likely to show up as an increase in the variance of permanent shocks.
Distinguishing between changes in the variance of shocks and in skill pricing can be useful for
understanding household consumption and savings behavior, since household decisions are likely to
respond quite differently to an increase in the price of skill than they would to an increase in the
variance of permanent or transitory shocks. Transitory shocks have little effect on consumption
behavior, while an increase in the variance of permanent shocks should lead to increases in consumption inequality over time within and across cohorts. Changes in skill prices, µt (·), are likely
to be more predictable and smooth over time, since they are largely driven by economic changes
in the supply of and demand for skills or by major policy changes. To the extent that they are
well-anticipated, changes in µt (·) are likely to have little effect on consumption inequality over time
for a given cohort; however, growth in the return to unobserved skill should raise consumption
inequality across successive cohorts. Furthermore, changes in the variance of permanent shocks
affect precautionary savings motives, while changes in skill prices should not (regardless of their
predictability).11
Workers of different ability/skill levels may face different levels of labor market risk, which may
10

A growing literature studies the implications for wage dynamics of different assumptions about wage setting in
markets with search frictions and worker productivity shocks (Flinn, 1986; Postel-Vinay and Turon, 2010; Yamaguchi,
2010; Burdett, Carrillo-Tudela, and Coles, 2011; Bagger, Fontaine, Postel-Vinay, and Robin, 2011). This literature
incorporates unobserved worker human capital or productivity differences but does not account for changing market
demands for human capital, implicitly assuming µt (θ) = µ(θ).
11
Changes in the underlying uncertainty of skill prices should affect precautionary savings motives in the same way
as changes in the variance of permanent shocks.

evolve differently over time. For example, the diffusion of new skill-biased technology in the presence
of labor market frictions can produce different trends in the variance of permanent shocks by ability,
since more able workers may adopt these technologies first (Violante, 2002). To account for this
possibility, our analysis explicitly accounts for heteroskedasticity in permanent shocks, allowing the
relationship between unobserved ability and the variance of permanent shocks to change freely over
time.
An important question is whether all of these earnings components can be separately identified
using standard panel data sets on wages/earnings without making strong distributional or functional
form assumptions. We, therefore, begin with a formal analysis of nonparametric identification,
drawing on insights from the measurement error literature (especially, Hu and Schennach (2008);
Schennach and Hu (2013)) and the analysis of Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2010). We focus
on the case where εit contains a permanent (Martingale) shock κit and a shock characterized by
a moving average process νit , allowing the distributions for these shocks to vary over time.12 We
derive conditions necessary for nonparametric identification of the distribution for θ and all µt (·)
pricing functions, as well as (nearly) all distributions and parameters characterizing the stochastic
process for idiosyncratic shocks.
Assuming νt follows a M A(q) process, our main theoretical result establishes that a panel of
length T ≥ 6 + 3q time periods is needed for full nonparametric identification. For modest q, this
is easily satisfied with common panel data sets like the PSID or National Longitudinal Surveys of
Youth (NLSY). Intuitively, identification of the distribution of θ and the µt (·) pricing functions
derives from the fact that correlations in wage residual changes far enough apart in time are due
the unobserved component θ and not idiosyncratic permanent or transitory shocks. Once these
are identified, the distributions of permanent and transitory shocks can be identified from joint
distributions of residuals closer together in time. These results apply to any cohort, so we can also
identify changes in the distribution of unobserved ability/skill across any cohorts we observe for
enough time periods.
We next briefly discuss identification and estimation using a moment-based approach standard
in the literature on earnings dynamics. Here, we restrict µt (·) to be polynomial functions and
discuss minimal data and moment requirements for identification of µt (·) and moments of the
distributions for unobserved ability, transitory and permanent shocks. We use minimum distance
12
Assumptions on εit of this nature are often employed in the literature (Abowd and Card, 1989; Blundell and
Preston, 1998; Haider, 2001; Gourinchas and Parker, 2002; Meghir and Pistaferri, 2004; Blundell, Pistaferri, and
Preston, 2008; Heathcote, Perri, and Violante, 2010).

estimation with second- and third-order residual moments to estimate our model with linear and
cubic µt (·) functions, considering different assumptions about the process for transitory shocks νt .
We first show that allowing for time-varying unobserved skill pricing functions significantly
improves the model’s fit to the data relative to the standard assumption that µt (·) are fixed. Accounting for unobserved skills is important for understanding the evolution of log earnings residuals.
Our results also demonstrate the importance of accounting for permanent and transitory shocks
when estimating the pricing of unobserved skills. Time patterns for the distribution of log earnings
residuals are quite different from the patterns estimated for the pricing of unobserved skills.13
We decompose the variance of residuals into components for (i) unobserved skill prices, (ii) permanent shocks, and (iii) transitory shocks. We also examine changes in µt (θ) at the top and bottom
of its distribution over time as well as potential changes in the distribution of θ across cohorts. We
highlight five main findings. (i) The returns to unobserved skills rose over the 1970s and early
1980s, fell over the late 1980s and early 1990s, and then remained quite stable through the end of
our sample period. Since the mid-1990s, we observe some evidence of polarization: the returns to
skill have declined at the bottom of the distribution while they have remained relatively constant
over the top half. (ii) The variance of unobserved skill changed very little across most cohorts in
our sample (those born between 1925 and 1955). (iii) The variance of transitory shocks jumped up
considerably in the early 1980s but shows little long-run trend otherwise over the more than thirty
year period we study. (iv) The variance of permanent shocks declined very slightly over the 1970s,
then rose systematically through the end of our sample by 15 to 20 log points. The increase in this
variance over the 1980s and 1990s was strongest for workers with low unobserved ability. (v) In
most years, the distribution of µt (θ) is positively skewed, while the distributions of permanent and
(especially) transitory shocks are negatively skewed.
This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide nonparametric identification results
for our model with unobserved ability/skills, permanent shocks, and transitory shocks following
an M A(q) process. Section 3 briefly discusses identification and estimation using a moment-based
approach, assuming polynomial µt (·) pricing functions. We describe the PSID data used to estimate
earnings dynamics for American men in Section 4 and report our empirical findings in Section 5.
We offer concluding thoughts in Section 6.
13

Key findings also hold for log weekly wage residuals as shown in Appendix B.

Nonparametric Identification
In this section, we provide nonparametric identification results for our model. The baseline

model is the following factor model:
Wi,t = µt (θi ) + εi,t for t = 1, . . . , T, and i = 1, . . . , n,

(2)

where the distributions of unobserved factors θi and εi,t are unspecified, the functional form of µt (·)
is also unspecified but strictly monotonic, and we only observe {Wi,t } (earnings or wage residuals
in our empirical context). We consider a short time panel, i.e. n is large and T is (relatively) small
and fixed. For notational simplicity, we drop the cross-sectional subscript i except where there may
otherwise be some confusion. First, we discuss identification when εt is independent over t. Then,
we generalize this result to account for serial correlation in εt .

2.1

Case 1: Serially Independent εt

From the model in Equation (2), we want to identify the following objects: (i) the distribution
of θ, (ii) the distributions of εt for all t, and (iii) the functions µt (·) for all t. We first define some
notation. For generic random variables A and B, let fA (·) and fA|B (·|·) denote the probability
density function of A and the conditional probability density function of A given B, respectively.
Similarly, FA (·) and FA|B (·|·) denote their cumulative distribution functions, and φA,B (·) denotes
the joint characteristic function. We want to identify fθ (·), fεt (·), and µt (·) for all t.
Since all components are nonparametric, we need some normalization. Throughout this section,
we impose µ1 (θ) = θ. The following regularity conditions ensure identification:
Assumption 1. The following conditions hold in equation (2) for T = 3:
(i) The joint density of θ, W1 , W2 , and W3 is bounded and continuous, and so are all their
marginal and conditional densities.
(ii) W1 , W2 , and W3 are mutually independent conditional on θ.
(iii) fW1 |W2 (W1 |W2 ) and fθ|W1 (θ|W1 ) form a bounded complete family of distributions indexed by
W2 and W1 , respectively.
(iv) For all θ̄, θ̃ ∈ Θ, the set {w3 : fW3 |θ (w3 |θ̄) 6= fW3 |θ (w3 |θ̃)} has positive probability whenever
θ̄ 6= θ̃.
(v) We normalize µ1 (θ) = θ and E[εt |θ] = 0 for all t.
8

Assumption 1 is adopted from Hu and Schennach (2008) and is also used in Cunha, Heckman,
and Schennach (2010). Condition (i) assumes a well-defined joint density of the persistent factor
θ and observed residuals. In our empirical setup, they are all continuous random variables, and
this condition holds naturally. Condition (ii) is the mutual independence assumption commonly
imposed in linear factor models. Note that εt may be heteroskedastic, since this condition only
requires conditional independence given θ. Conditions (iii) and (iv) are the key requirements for
identification. Heuristically speaking, condition (iii) requires enough variation for each conditional
density given different values of the conditioning variable. For example, exponential families satisfy this condition. Newey and Powell (2003) apply it to identification of nonparametric models
with instrumental variables, and it is standard in many nonparametric analyses. Condition (iv)
holds when µ3 (·) is strictly monotonic, which is natural in our empirical context. Conditional heteroskedasticity can also ensure condition (iv) (see Hu and Schennach (2008)). Condition (v) is a
standard location and scale normalization.
The following lemma establishes identification for T = 3, so a panel with 3 (or more) periods is
necessary for nonparametric identification of the full model.
Lemma 1. Under Assumption 1, fθ (·), fεt (·), and µt (·) are identified for all t.
The proof for this (and subsequent results) is provided in Appendix A. Here, we sketch its
key steps. The spectral decomposition result in Theorem 1 of Hu and Schennach (2008) gives
identification of fW1 |θ (·|·), fW2 |θ (·|·), and fW3 ,θ (·, ·) from fW1 ,W2 ,W3 (·, ·, ·), which is already known
from data. As in Theorem 2 in Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2010), fθ (·) can be recovered
from fW3 ,θ (·, ·) by integrating out θ. Next, for t = 2, 3, we can identify µt (·) from the conditional
density fWt |θ (·, ·), since we know that E[Wt |θ] = µt (θ) from E[εt |θ] = E[εt ] = 0. Finally, we can
identify fεt |θ (·|·) by applying the standard variable transformation given Wt = µt (θ) + εt with
known fWt |θ (·|·) and µt (·), from which fεt (·) is recovered immediately.

2.2

Case 2: Serially Correlated εt

We now generalize the model to allow for serial correlation in εt for our main identification
result. Specifically, we decompose the idiosyncratic error εt = κt + νt into two components: a
persistent shock, κt , and a transitory shock, νt . The persistent shock follows a martingale/unit
root process with κt = κt−1 + ηt , and the transitory shock has serial dependence only over q
periods, i.e. fνt ,νt+s (ν1 , ν2 ) = fνt (ν1 ) · fνt+s (ν2 ) for s > q. With this, the model can be written as
Wt = µt (θ) + κt + νt .
9

(3)

As discussed below, it is possible to identify both fθ (·) and µt (·) under this general structure if a
long enough time panel is available, i.e. T ≥ 6 + 3q.
To further identify the processes for permanent and transitory shocks, we impose the following
structure for κt and νt :
κt = κt−1 + ηt = κt−1 + σt (θ)ζt
νt = ξt +

q
X

(4)

βj ξt−j

(5)

j=1

where ζt and ξt are mean zero processes whose distributions can vary over time. The persistent
shock ηt is conditional heteroskedastic through σt (θ), and the transitory shock follows a MA(q)
process. For simplicity, we analyze the case of q = 1 in detail; however, the results can be readily
extended to any finite q as we discuss below. For q = 1, equation (3) becomes
Wt = µt (θ) +

t
X

σj (θ)ζj + (ξt + βt ξt−1 ) .

(6)

j=1

In addition to fθ (·) and all µt (·), we identify σt (·), fζt (·), fξt (·), and βt for all but the last two
periods under the following assumption. (Define ∆At ≡ At − At−1 and θt ≡ µt (θ).)
Assumption 2. The following conditions hold in equation (6) for T = 9:
(i) The joint density of θ, W1 , W2 , W3 , ∆W4 , . . . , ∆W9 is bounded and continuous, and so are
all their marginal and conditional densities.
(ii) Unobserved components ζt , ξt , and θ are mutually independent for all t = 1, . . . , 9.
(iii) fW1 |∆W4 (w1 |∆w4 ) and fθ|W1 (θ|w1 ) form a bounded complete family of distributions indexed by
∆W4 and W1 , respectively. The same condition holds for (W2 , ∆W5 , θ2 ) and (W3 , ∆W6 , θ3 ).
(iv) For all θ̄, θ̃ ∈ Θ, the set {w : f∆W7 |θ (w|θ̄) 6= f∆W7 |θ (w|θ̃)} has positive probability whenever
θ̄ 6= θ̃. The same condition holds for f∆W8 |θ and f∆W9 |θ .
(v) We impose the following normalization: κ0 = ξ0 = 0, µ1 (θ) = θ, E[ζt ] = E[ξt ] = 0, E[ζt2 ] = 1,
and σt (·) > 0 for all t.

The conditions in Assumption 2 mainly extend those in Assumption 1 to a longer time period
and to include some differences in {Wt }. Differencing is required to cancel out the persistent
shock κt , which helps to map this problem into that of Lemma 1. Unless ∆Wt is degenerate
on an interval, these conditions hold in a similar situation to that described for Assumption 1.
Condition (ii) implies similar mutual independence among W1 , W2 , W3 , ∆W4 , . . . , ∆W9 conditional
on θ. Condition (vi) is a technical assumption that assures the equivalence between the sequence
of moments and the distribution. We now state the main identification result.
Theorem 1. Under Assumption 2, fθ (·), {fζt (·), fξt (·), βt }7t=1 , {σt (·)}7t=1 , and {µt (·)}9t=1 are identified.
The proof provided in Appendix A.2 proceeds in three main steps. First, we jointly consider
distributions of (Wt , ∆Wt+3 , ∆Wt+6 ) for t = 1, 2, 3. For example, consider:
W1 = θ + ε1 = θ + η1 + ν1 = θ + σ1 (θ)ζ1 + ν1
∆W4 = ∆µ4 (θ) + ∆ε4 = ∆µ4 (θ) + η4 + ∆ν4 = ∆µ4 (θ) + σ4 (θ)ζ4 + ∆ν4
∆W7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + ∆ε7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + η7 + ∆ν7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + σ7 (θ)ζ7 + ∆ν7 .
These triplets are mutually independent conditional on θ. The differences ∆W4 and ∆W7 are
analogous to W2 and W3 in the simpler model with serially independent εt . We can simply apply
Lemma 1 to identify fθ (·) and both ∆µ4 (·) and ∆µ7 (·) functions. A similar approach can be
taken for triplets (W2 , ∆W5 , ∆W8 ) and (W3 , ∆W6 , ∆W9 ); however, these cases are slightly more
complicated since W2 and W3 depend on µ2 (·) and µ3 (·), respectively. Still, monotonicity of the
functions µt (·) for t = 2, 3 and knowledge of fθ (·) enables identification of µt (·), ∆µt+3 (·), and
∆µt+6 (·) for t = 2, 3. Altogether, we identify fθ (·) and all µt (·) functions from these three sets of
triplets.14 Notice that we actually identify fWt |θ (·|·) in this step, which will be used in the next
steps.
In a second step, we establish identification of E[ξt2 ], βt , and σt (·) for t = 1, . . . , 7 using various
second moments between W1 , . . . , W9 . For example, consider the triplet (W1 , W2 , W3 ). From
E[W1 W3 ], E[W12 ], and E[W1 , W2 ], we can identify E[σ12 (θ)], E[ξ12 ], and β1 , respectively. With these,
σ1 (·) is identified from E[W12 |θ], which can be calculated from fW1 |θ (·|·). We can apply this same
argument to triplets {(Wt , Wt+1 , Wt+2 )}7t=2 to identify analogous elements up through t = 7.
14

This step does not rely on the M A(q) structure for νt . Only serial independence νt ⊥
⊥ νt+s for s > q is needed
to establish identification of fθ (·) and all µt (·).

11

In a third step, we identify fηt (·) and fξt (·) for t = 1, . . . , 7. In this step, we first identify
the infinite sequence of moments {(E[ηtk ], E[ξtk ])}∞
k=1 by mathematical induction. Then, the Carleman’s condition in Assumption 2 (vi) enables us to apply Hamburger’s Theorem to determine
{fηt (·), fξt (·)}7t=1 uniquely.

2.3

Identification under Homoskedasticity

When ηt ⊥⊥ θ so εt is homoskedastic, condition (iv) of Assumption 2 requires strict monotonicity
of ∆µt (·) for t = 7, 8, 9. This is quite strong, especially in light of recent discussions of polarization
in the demand for skill. Fortunately, this assumption can be relaxed. In Appendix A.3, we show
that the model is still fully identified by replacing condition (iv) with the following lower level
assumption on µt (·) (along with some minor additional technical conditions):
For t = 7, 8, 9, the functions ∆µt (θ) are continuously differentiable with ∆µ0t (θ∗ ) = 0 for at
most a finite number of θ∗ .
This condition allows ∆µt (·) to be non-monotonic. However, it does not allow the marginal value
of unobserved skill µ0t (·) to be time invariant over an interval of θ in later years. The complete set
of assumptions and identification proof can be found in Appendix A.3.

2.4

Some General Comments on Identification

For panels of length T ≥ 9, the same general strategy as above can be used to identify fθ (·),
−2
{µt (·)}Tt=1 and {fηt (·), fξt (·), βt }Tt=1
. While not surprising, the fact that distributions of transitory

and permanent shocks cannot be separately identified for the final two periods is useful to keep in
mind during estimation.
Our identification strategy can also be used for more general M A(q) processes. In this case, we
need to consider triplets of the form (Wt , ∆Wt+q+2 , ∆Wt+2q+4 ) to ensure independence across the
three observations. As q increases, we also need to include additional sets of triplets to ‘roll’ over
in step 1 of our proof. Thus, a panel of length T ≥ 6 + 3q is needed, so the required panel length
increases with persistence in the moving average shock at the rate of 3q. We can still identify µt (·)
for all T periods; however, we can only identify fηt (·), fξt (·), and βt up through period T − q − 1.
Finally, our approach rules out any stochastic process that does not eventually die out, including
an AR(1) process. Independence across some subsets of observations is crucial at a number of points
in our identification proof, so accommodating these type of errors would require a very different
approach. Still, our results generalize to an arbitrarily long M A(q) process provided q is finite.

12

Of course, the data demands grow quickly with q making it impractical to estimate models with q
much larger than five in typical panel survey data sets.15

3

A Moment-Based Approach
We next consider a moment-based estimation approach that simultaneously uses data from all

time periods; however, we restrict our analysis to the case where
µt (θ) = m0,t + m1,t θ + ... + mp,t θp

(7)

are pth order polynomials. Because our data contain multiple cohorts with the age distribution
changing over time, it is useful to explicitly incorporate age, a in the current discussion:
Wi,a,t = µt (θi ) + κi,a,t + νi,a,t

(8)

κi,a,t = κi,a−1,t−1 + ηi,a,t

(9)

νi,a,t = ξi,a,t + β1,t ξi,a−1,t−1 + β2,t ξi,a−2,t−2 + ... + βq,t ξi,a−q,t−q .

(10)

As above, we normalize µ1 (θ) = θ and continue to assume all residual components are mean zero
in each period (for each age group/cohort): E[µt (θi )] = E[κi,a,t ] = E[νi,a,t ] = 0 for all a, t.
In this section, we describe residual moment conditions as well as minimum data and moment
requirements for identification. In particular, we discuss the residual moments and data needed
to identify various moments of shock and unobserved skill distributions as well as different order
polynomials for the µt (·) functions. In Section 5, we use these moments to estimate our model.
We focus on the evolution of skill pricing functions over time and decompose the variance in log
earnings residuals over time into components related to: (i) the pricing of unobserved skills µt (θ),
(ii) permanent shocks κi,a,t , and (iii) transitory shocks νi,a,t . We further extend our analysis to
examine the evolution of higher moments of distributions related to these three components.

3.1

Moments, Parameters and Identification

We assume individuals begin receiving shocks ηi,a,t and ξi,a,t when they enter the labor market
at age a = 1. Thus, κi,0,t = νi,0,t = 0 and ηi,a,t = ξi,a,t = 0 for all a ≤ 0. We also assume that
the distributions of ηi,a,t and ξi,a,t shocks are age-invariant, changing only with time. Importantly,
the distributions of κi,a,t will depend on age as older individuals will have experienced a longer

Because all shocks are assumed to be mean zero, these moments are equivalent to central moments.

The last term, E(νi,a,t νi,a+l,t+l ), reflects the covariance of transitory shocks and is straightforward
to determine for any q. These covariances are generally non-zero for l ≤ q and zero otherwise. For
q = 1, we have E(νi,a,t νi,a+1,t+1 ) = β1,t+1 σξ2t and E(νi,a,t νi,a+l,t+l ) = 0, ∀l ≥ 2.
As equation (11) makes clear, the variance of earnings residuals can change over time for three
reasons: (i) unobserved skills may become more or less valuable (i.e. µt (·) may change), (ii) permanent shocks accumulate, and (iii) transitory shocks may become more or less variable. Covariances
across time are key to sorting out these three potential factors. Holding t constant in equation (12)
but varying l, the second term due to permanent shocks remains constant, while the final term
disappears altogether for l > q. As emphasised in our nonparametric identification results above,
we can learn about the µt (·) functions and the distribution of θ by looking at covariances between
residuals in some period t and changes in residuals more than q periods later.
3.1.1

A Single Cohort

How many periods of data do we need if residual variances and covariances are used in estimation? It is useful to begin our analysis with a single cohort (normalizing a = t), following them over
time for t = 1, ..., T where T ≥ 3. For simplicity, consider an M A(1) process for νt and homoskedasticity in ηt (i.e. σt (θ) = σt , ∀θ). In this case, we need to identify/estimate a total of (4 + p)T + p − 9
parameters.16 For T periods of data, we have a total of T (T +1)/2+T −1 moments, which includes
16
The parameters include 2p − 1 parameters for E[θ2 ], ..., E[θ2p ]; (T − 1)(p + 1) parameters for µt (θ) polynomials
for t = 2, ..., T ; 2(T − 2) parameters for ση2t and σξ2t for t = 1, ..., T − 2; and T − 3 parameters for β1,t , t = 2, ..., T − 2.

14

T (T + 1)/2 unique variance/covariance terms and T − 1 moments coming from E[µt (θi )] = 0 for
t = 2, ..., T . A necessary condition for identification is, therefore, (4+p)T +p−9 ≤ T (T +1)/2+T −1.
Re-arranging this inequality, identification requires
p≤

T 2 − 5T + 16
2(T + 1)

as well as T ≥ 3. Using only variances and covariances in estimation, identification with cubic µt (·)
functions requires a panel of length T ≥ 10, while quadratic µt (·) functions require T ≥ 8. Despite
the data requirements implied by Theorem 1, we require more than nine periods of data when µt (·)
is a high order polynomial if we only use second order moments to estimate the model.
Using higher order moments can reduce the required panel length. For example, Hausman
et al. (1991) show the value of adding the moments E[W1k Wt ] for k = 2, ..., p. Incorporating these


p+1
3
moments adds 2(p − 1) additional parameters ση31 , ..., σηp+1
. While the number of
1 , σξ1 , ..., σξ1
additional parameters does not depend on T , the number of moments increases by (T − 1)(p − 1).
These extra moments provide relatively direct information about mj,t parameters (and higher
moments of the distribution of θ) as t varies.
More generally, we could incorporate a broader set of higher moments in estimation. Indeed,
if we want to identify moments for the distribution of shocks up to order k (e.g. σηkt and σξkt )
for all t = 1, ..., T , we need to incorporate up to kth order moments for residuals in all periods.
Including E[Wtj ] for j = 3, ..., k adds (k − 2)T new moments (relative to variance/covariances only),
but it adds 2(k − 2)(T − 2) new parameters for higher moments of ηt and ξt as well as (k − 2)p
new parameters for higher moments of θ. Thus, higher order cross-product terms should also be
incorporated.17 In practice, it may be difficult to precisely estimate higher order residual moments
given the sample sizes of typical panel data sets.
3.1.2

Multiple Cohorts

In many applications, it is common to follow multiple cohorts at once. If the distribution of
cohorts changes over time (e.g. new cohorts enter the data at later dates while older ones age out
of the sample), then it is important to account for this directly as in equations (11) and (12).
Although the distributions for ηit and ξit are assumed to depend only on time and not age or
These parameter counts incorporate the normalization µ1 (θ) = θ. The normalization ξi,0,0 = 0 means that we are
unable to identify β1,1 . Furthermore, as in Theorem 1, (β1,t , ση2t , σξ2t ) are unidentified
for t = T− 1, T for q = 1.

cohort, the distribution of κi,a,t will vary with age since older cohorts have accumulated a longer
history of permanent shocks.18
Our identification results above can be applied separately for each cohort; however, differences
in the variance and covariance terms across age/cohort for the same time periods in equations (11)
and (12) can be used to help identify the effects of permanent and transitory shocks. The fact that
market-based skill pricing functions µt (·) vary only with time and not age/cohort is particularly
helpful. To see why, consider equation (12) for l > q. In this case, the final term due to transitory
shocks disappears, while the first term is the same for all cohorts. The second term reflects the
sum of all permanent shocks from the time of labor market entry to year t for each cohort. By
comparing these covariances across cohorts for fixed t, we can recover the variances of permanent
shocks from time zero through t − 1. Of course, this very simple identification strategy for ση2t can
no longer be used if the distributions of permanent shocks varies freely with age or cohort. Allowing
for cohort differences in the distribution of θ also reduces the value of additional cohorts, since any
terms related to unobserved skills would then become cohort-specific. Still, as long as skill pricing
functions are independent of age and cohort, the inclusion of multiple cohorts provides additional
variation that can be useful for identification and estimation even if the distributions of shocks are
allowed to vary by age/cohort and the distribution of skills varies across cohorts.

PSID Data
The PSID is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of individuals and families in the

U.S. beginning in 1968. The survey was conducted annually through 1997 and biennially since. We
use data collected from 1971 through 2009. Since earnings and weeks of work were collected for
the year prior to each survey, our analysis considers earnings and weekly wages from 1970-2008.
Our sample is restricted to male heads of households from the core (SRC) sample.19 We use
earnings from any year these men were ages 30-59, had positive wage and salary income, worked at
least one week, and were not enrolled as a student. Our earnings measure reflects total wage and
salary earnings (excluding farm and business income) and is denominated in 1996 dollars using the
18

This variation adds new parameters to be identified/estimated for each additional cohort. In particular, we must
identify/estimate separate σκka(0),0 for each cohort, where a(0) reflects their age at date t = 0. At very young ages
(i.e. a < q), the distribution of νi,a,t also varies with age.
19
We exclude those from any PSID oversamples (SEO, Latino) as well as those with non-zero individual weights.
The earnings questions we use are asked only of household heads. We also restrict our sample to those who were
heads of household and not students during the survey year of the observation of interest as well as two years earlier.
Our sampling scheme is very similar to that of Gottschalk and Moffitt (2012), except that we do not include earnings
measures before age 30.

16

CPI-U-RS. We trim the top and bottom 1% of all earnings measures within year by ten-year age
cells. The resulting sample contains 3,302 men and 33,207 person-year observations – roughly ten
observations for each individual.
Our sample is composed of 92% whites, 6% blacks and 1% hispanics with an average age of 47
years old. We create seven education categories based on current years of completed schooling: 1-5
years, 6-8 years, 9-11 years, 12 years, 13-15 years, 16 years, and 17 or more years. In our sample,
16% of respondents finished less than 12 years of schooling, 34% had exactly 12 years of completed
schooling, 20% completed some college (13-15 years), 21% completed college (16 years), and 10%
had more than 16 years of schooling.
Our analysis focuses on log earnings residuals after controlling for differences in educational
attainment, race, and age. (Log weekly wage residuals are considered in Appendix B.) Residuals
are derived from year-specific regressions of log earnings (or weekly wages) on age, race, and education indicators, along with interactions between race and education indicators and a third order
polynomial in age. Figure 2 shows selected quantiles of the log earnings residual distribution from
1970 through 2008 for our sample, while Figure 3 displays changes in the commonly reported ratio
of log earnings residuals at the 90th percentile over residuals at the 10th percentile (the ‘90-10
ratio’), as well as analogous results for the 90-50 and 50-10 ratios. This figure reports changes in
these ratios from 1970 to the reported year. The 90-10 ratio exhibits a modest increase over the
1970s, a sharp increase in the early 1980s, followed by ten years of modest decline from 1985-95,
and then an increase from 1995 through 2008. Over the full time period, the 90-10 log earnings
residual ratio increased more than 0.5, with nearly two-thirds of that increase coming between 1980
and 1985. The figure further shows that changes in inequality were quite different at the top and
bottom of the residual distribution. While the 90-50 ratio shows a steady increase of about 0.25
over the 38 years of our sample, changes in the 50-10 ratio largely mirror changes in the 90-10 ratio.
Thus, the sharp increase in residual inequality in the early 1980s is largely driven by sharp declines
in log earnings at the bottom of the distribution. Similarly, declines in residual inequality over the
late 1980s and early 1990s come from increases in earnings at the bottom relative to the middle of
the residual distribution.

Estimates of Unobserved Skill Pricing Functions and Earnings
Dynamics over Time
We use minimum distance estimation and the residual moments described above to estimate the

model for men using the PSID. We discuss results for log earnings residuals in the text; however,
conclusions are quite similar for log weekly wages as reported in Appendix B. Because some age cells
have few observations when calculating residual variances and covariances (or higher moments),
we aggregate within three broad age groupings corresponding to ages 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59.
Specifically, for variances/covariances we use the following moments:
1
nA,t,l

Wi,a,t Wi,a−l,t−l → E[Wi,a,t Wi,a−l,t−l |a ∈ A, t, l]

where A reflects one of our three age categories, nA,t,l is the total number of observations used in
calculating this moment, and ωa,t,l is the fraction of observations used in calculating this moment
that are of age a in period t. We weight each moment by the share of observations used for that
PPP
sample moment (i.e. nA,t,l /
nA,t,l ). Higher moments are treated analogously.
A

l

We impose a few restrictions to reduce the dimension of the problem given our modest sample
sizes. First, we assume that the M A(q) stochastic process remains the same over our sample period,
so βj,t = βj for all j = 1, ..., q and t = 2, ..., T . Second, we assume that ση2τ = ση20 and σξ2τ = σξ20 for
all τ years prior to our sample period. These assumptions are useful in accounting for differences
in residual variances and covariances across cohorts observed in our initial survey year without
substantially increasing the number of parameters to be estimated.20
We decompose the variance of log residual earnings into three components:
1. pricing of unobserved skills: V ar[µt (θ)];

2. permanent shocks: ση2t and σκ2t =

20

More generally, we could estimate separate variances for these shocks going back to the year of labor market entry
for the oldest cohort in our initial sample period. Without observing earnings in those earlier years, these variances
would need to be identified from cross-cohort differences in the variances and covariances we do observe. We have
explored different assumptions about these pre-survey year variances (e.g. linear time trends); however, the results
we discuss are robust across all assumptions.

19

We also discuss the evolution of different quantiles in the distributions of µt (θ) over time when we
consider cubic µt (·) pricing functions.

5.1

Linear µt (·)

We begin with the case of linear µt (·), assuming homoskedasticity of all shocks. No distributional assumptions on θ or the permanent and transitory shocks are needed to decompose the
residual variances. Table 1 reports the minimum values of the objective function and key parameter
estimates determining the process for νt under different assumptions about µt (·) and the stochastic
process for νt . The first three columns report results when µt (θ) is restricted to be time invariant.
This is equivalent to including individual fixed effects, as in most of the PSID-based literature. The
remaining columns allow µt (·) to vary freely over time. A few lessons emerge from this table. First,
comparing columns 1-3 with their counterparts in columns 4-6 shows that allowing for changes in
the pricing of unobserved skills significantly improves the fit to the data. This is generally true
for any M A(q) specification for νt .21 We strongly reject the restriction of constant µt (·) functions
at 5% significance levels. Second, the stochastic process for νt has a modest degree of persistence.
We can reject q = 1 in favor of q = 2; however, we cannot reject that q = 2 and q = 3 fit equally
well at 5% significance levels.22 We also report results for an M A(5) for comparison. Third, the
estimated serial correlation in transitory shocks is weaker when µt (·) is allowed to vary over time
(e.g. β1 estimates are more than 10% lower).
Unless otherwise noted, the rest of our analysis focuses on the case with time-varying µt (·)
and an M A(3) process for νt ; however, other M A(q) processes and an ARM A(1, 1) yield very
similar conclusions (see Appendix B). Figure 4 reports the estimated variances (and standard
errors) for µt (θ), ηt , and ξt over time.23 Figure 5 decomposes the total residual variance into
its three components: unobserved skills µt (θ), permanent shocks κt , and transitory shocks νt . All
three components are important for understanding the evolution of earnings inequality in the PSID;
however, they contribute in very different ways over time. Initially quite low, the variance of returns
to unobserved ability/skills rises more than 10 percentage points over the 1970s and early 1980s,
then falls back to its original level by the late 1990s. It remains fairly constant thereafter. The
21

As shown in Appendix B, allowing for time-varying µt (·) functions also substantially improves the fit when νt is
assumed to be ARM A(1, 1).
22
These tests for q values are based on a comparison of the minimized objective functions (reported in the first row
of the table), which are distributed χ2 (1).
23
In some years, the variance of ηt is estimated to be zero; we do not report its standard errors for these years.
As shown in Section 2, distributions for transitory and permanent shocks are not identified for the last few years
of our panel; however, µt (·) is identified for all periods. Our figures report variances for permanent and transitory
components through 2002 and variances for µt (θ) through 2008.

variance of the transitory component rises sharply (5-10 percentage points) in the early 1980s, then
fluctuates up and down for about ten years before it stabilizes in the late 1990s. The variance of the
permanent component declines slightly over the 1970s, then rises continuously and at roughly the
same rate over the rest of the sample period. Between 1980 and 2002, the variance of permanent
shocks increases by nearly 20 percentage points, more than the increase in total residual variance.
As a share of the total variance in log earnings residuals, the transitory component plays the largest
role until the mid-1990s, after which the permanent shocks dominate. Inequality due to variation
in the returns to unobserved skills reaches its peak of more than 40% of the total residual variance
around 1980.
The time patterns in Figure 5 differ from the conclusions reached in both the PSID- and
CPS-based literatures on log wage/earnings dynamics and inequality. The CPS-based literature
implicitly ignores the roles of permanent and transitory shocks, equating changes in the total
variance of log earnings/weekly wage residuals with changes in the returns to unobserved skills.
This need not be the case in our model. Figure 5 suggests very different time patterns for the
returns to unobserved skills compared to the total variance of log earnings residuals. (Similar
patterns are estimated for log weekly wage residuals as reported in Appendix B.) While the total
variance of log earnings residuals mainly increased in the early 1980s and the late 1990s and 2000s,
variation in the returns to unobserved skills increased smoothly from 1970 to the mid-1980s before
declining over the next 15-20 years. Variation in the returns to unobserved skill is quite stable after

1995, in sharp contrast with the rapid increase in total residual variance.
The PSID-based literature explores the relative importance of permanent and transitory shocks;
however, it typically ignores variation in the pricing of unobserved skills (i.e. assumes µt (·) = µ(·)).24
Figure 6 shows that this is not innocuous, even if one is only interested in the relative importance of
permanent and transitory components. This figure decomposes the total variance into ‘permanent’
and ‘transitory’ components based on a model that assumes µt (·) = µ(·) is time invariant. Here,
the ‘permanent’ component is given by the variance of µ(θ) + κt . These estimates suggest more
modest increases in the permanent component and stronger increases in the transitory component
over the early 1980s relative to estimates from our more general model that allows for variation in
unobserved skill prices (Figure 5).
In Appendix B, we explore the robustness of our main variance decomposition results (Figure 5)
to a few alternative specifications. First, we show that different assumptions about the transitory
component yield very similar results. Specifically, the dynamics and relative importance of all
three variance components are quite similar to those shown in Figure 5 if νt follows an M A(1),
M A(5), or ARM A(1, 1) process. Second, we consider the possibility that the variance of transitory
24
There are a few notable exceptions in the literature (e.g. Haider 2001, Moffitt and Gottschalk 2012); however,
these studies abstract from other important features of the problem. Haider (2001) abstracts from permanent shocks,
ηt . Moffitt and Gottschalk (2012) assume that the variance of permanent shocks remains constant over time, but
they multiply both θ and κt by the same time-varying ‘price’. We consider this specification below.

and permanent shocks may vary with age. Using rich administrative data from Norway, Blundell,
Graber, and Mogstad (2013) estimate declines in the variance of both permanent and transitory
shocks prior to age 35, with remarkable stability thereafter. We, therefore, estimate our model
allowing the variances of both ηi,a,t and ξi,a,t to be linear functions of age over ages 20-35 and
constant thereafter. Our estimates suggest that the variances of both permanent and transitory
shocks decline by roughly 25% over these first fifteen years of workers’ careers; however, the variance
decompositions from this more general specification are nearly identical to that of Figure 5 (see
Figure 16 in Appendix B).
5.1.1

Permanent Shocks to Skills

In our baseline model of earnings dynamics, shocks are distinct from ability or skills and, therefore, do not appear inside the pricing function µt (·). Alternatively, one might treat permanent
shocks ηt as shocks to unobserved skills, specifying log earnings residuals as Wt = µ̃t (θ + κt ) + νt .
Assuming κ0 = 0, θ reflects initial skill levels. Moffitt and Gottschalk (2012) estimate this alternative model where µ̃t (·) is linear and the variance of permanent shocks, ηt , is constant over time.25
The assumption of linearity implies that µ̃t (·) = m̃0,t + m̃1,t θ + m̃1,t κt , so it is still possible to
decompose the residual variance into three components: variation due to initial skill differences
25

Moffitt and Gottschalk (2012) also allow for heterogeneous growth rates in unobserved ability/skill; however, the
estimated variance of these growth rates is insignificantly different from zero. Hryshko (2012) also finds no evidence
of heterogenous growth rates when Martingale/unit root shocks are included.

(b) Time-Varying ση2t

θ, variation due to permanent innovations in unobserved skills κt , and variation due to transitory
shocks νt . Assuming the variance of ηt remains constant over time effectively restricts the variance
contribution due to initial skills to perfectly co-move over time with the contribution due to innovations in skill as seen in Figure 7(a).26 This alternative model yields a slightly greater increase in
the transitory component when compared with our baseline model (Figure 5), but its time pattern
is quite similar. The time patterns for components related to θ and κt are quite different from their
counterparts in Figure 5, with the value of skills increasing slowly but continually over the entire
sample period in Figure 7(a).
Figure 7(b) reveals that much of the discrepancy between these results and those of our baseline model is due to the time-invariance assumption that ση2t = ση2 . Relaxing this assumption,
Figure 7(b) shows that the return to unobserved skill rose and then fell over time (peaking in the
early 1980s) as observed in Figure 5. While this rise and fall is noticeably more muted in Figure 7(b), the transitory and permanent components show fairly similar time patterns across the
two figures.
Although, both our baseline model in equations (8)-(10) and this alternative specification (with
time-varying ση2t ) produce a very similar fit to the data, we focus on our baseline specification
26

The co-movement of the first two components is not exactly the same due to changes in the age distribution over
time, which affects the variance of κt across the entire population.

25

in the rest of the paper for two primary reasons. First, our nonparametric identification results
of Section 2 directly apply to the baseline model, and we are interested in more general µt (·)
pricing functions. Analogous nonparametric identification results for the alternative model with
permanent ability/skill shocks would require a different approach. Second, recent studies document
large increases in the variance of wages across firms/plants for similar workers (Dunne et al., 2004;
Barth et al., 2011). Barth et al. (2011) show that this increase is not caused by changes in the
sorting of workers across establishments by skill, arguing instead that it is the result of a widening
in the dispersion of productivity across plants. This is consistent with an increase in the variance
of permanent shocks in our baseline model, where those shocks (at least partially) incorporate
differences in wage payments across firms.27
5.1.2

Cohort Differences in the Distribution of Unobserved Ability

Thus far, we have assumed that all cohorts have the same distribution of unobserved ability.
Our identification results can be applied separately for each cohort (assuming they appear in the
data for at least 9 years), so it is possible, in theory, to estimate everything separately for each
cohort. Given sample sizes in the PSID, this is impractical. Instead, we allow the variance of θ
to vary across cohorts, assuming the skill pricing functions and stochastic processes for all shocks
depend only on calendar time.28 We re-estimate our baseline model assuming the path for σθ,c
across cohorts can be represented by a cubic spline (with two interior knots). Figure 8(a) reports
the estimated variance of θ across cohorts along with 95% confidence bands. These results suggest
very similar variation in unobserved ability across most of the cohorts in our sample. The variance
of θ for cohorts born between 1925 and 1955 ranges between 0.1 and 0.15. The point estimates
suggest a sizeable increase in the variance for later cohorts; however, these estimates are very
imprecise as evident from the growing standard errors. These later cohorts do not appear in our
data for many years, since we first start following them when they turn age 30 (and the PSID moves
to a biennial survey in 1997). Importantly, Figure 8(b) shows that allowing for cohort variation in
the variance of θ has little effect on our baseline variance decomposition results.
27
It would be interesting to exploit worker-firm matched panel data to further decompose the variances of shocks
into worker- and firm-specific components.
28
Given linear skill pricing functions µt (·), our first stage log earnings regressions absorb any mean differences
in the distribution of θ across cohorts. Controlling for unrestricted year-specific age effects makes it impossible to
separately identify mean differences across cohorts in this case.

Cubic µt (·) and Third Order Moments

We next estimate our baseline model assuming µt (θ) is a cubic function (normalizing µ1985 (θ) =
θ). We do not impose monotonicity on the µt (·) functions; however, the results are quite similar if
we do. In addition to variances and covariances, we also incorporate third-order residual moments
in estimation.29 This aids in identification of µt (·) pricing functions and allows for estimation of
third-order moments for permanent and transitory shocks. We continue to assume that shocks are
homoskedastic for now, relaxing this assumption below.
Our third-order moment conditions contain moments of θ up to E(θ9 ). While we could estimate
these higher moments directly along with all other parameters of the model, we instead assume
that fθ is a mixture of two normal distributions. Figure 9(a) shows the estimated distribution for
θ.30 Figure 9(b) performs the same type of variance decomposition as above. The results are quite
similar to those assuming linear µt (·) functions.
Figure 10 shows the evolution of estimated µt (·) pricing functions for each decade. These
29

Specifically, we include all E[Wa,t , Wa−l,t−l , Wa−l−k,t−l−k ] moments along with all variances/covariances. In
aggregating across cohorts, we calculate these third-order moments in the same way we calculate variance/covariance
terms.
30
The first mixture component has a mean of .013 and standard deviation of 0.366, while the second has a mean of
-1.290 and standard deviation of 1.870. The mixing probability places a weight of 99% on the first distribution and
1% on the second.

functions are quite flat in the early 1970s, consistent with very low variance of µt (θ) in that period.
The increased importance of unobserved skills throughout the 1970s and early 1980s is reflected in
the steepening of the µt (θ) functions over this period. This is followed by declining inequality and
a flattening in the µt (θ) pricing functions over the late 1980s and early 1990s. Beginning in the
mid-1990s, the µt (θ) functions start to flatten at the bottom of the θ distribution, such that there
is little difference in the reward to skill at the low end. The last few µt (θ) functions actually appear
to decline slightly in θ for very low values.31 At the same time, the µt (θ) functions are quite stable
or even steepening slightly at the top of the distribution.
These patterns are more simply summarized in Figure 11, which shows the evolution of selected
quantiles and the 90-10, 90-50, and 50-10 ratios for the distribution for µt (θ) (the latter are relative
to their 1970 values). The 90-10 ratio follows a similar pattern to that observed for the variance
of µt (θ) reported in Figure 9. The 50-10 ratio evolves much like the 90-10 ratio, increasing from
1970-1985, then falling fairly systematically ever since (except for a brief but sharp increase in the
early 1990s). The 90-50 ratio shows a similar pattern through the mid-1990s, rising and falling over
that period. Interestingly, while the 50-10 ratio falls rapidly over the late 1990s and early 2000s,
the 90-50 ratio is relatively flat over that period. Since the mid-1990s, unobserved skill prices have
31
It should be noted that standard errors are sizeable for µt (θ) at very low and high values of θ, especially in the
last few years.

become more compressed over the bottom of the distribution while they have remained stable at
the top. These patterns differ markedly from those observed for total log earnings residuals as
reported in Figures 2 and 3.
The patterns for µt (·) imply an increasing (more positive) skewness over the 1990s. Figure 12
shows the skewness of total log earnings residuals along with the skewness for the permanent and
transitory components of earnings over time. All are typically negatively skewed, in contrast to
the skewness for µt (θ), which is positive in all years except a few in the mid-1980s. The skewness
of permanent shocks is generally declining except for a dramatic one-year jump in the early 1980s.
Over the entire period, the skewness goes from slightly less than zero to around -2. There is no
obvious trend to the skewness of transitory shocks, which hovers between -2 and -4 in most years.
5.2.1

Heteroskedasticity in Permanent Shocks

Thus far, we have assumed that the distributions of all shocks are independent of unobserved
ability. We next examine whether the variance of permanent shocks depends on θ as in equation (4),
assuming σt (θ) is linear in θ for all t.
Figure 13(a) shows the variance of κt for three different quantiles of the θ distribution. Interestingly, our estimates imply notable differences in the variability of permanent shocks (and
their time patterns) for workers of different ability levels. Among low-ability workers at the 10th
percentile, the the variance of permanent shocks increased rapidly in the 1980s and early 1990s

(from less than 0.03 in 1980 to nearly 0.20 by the mid-1990s). The increase in variability over the
1980s and early 1990s was much more modest for high ability types (at the 90th percentile) and
followed a decade of declining variability. Near the end of our sample period in the late 1990s, the
variability of permanent shocks jumps up, such that the total increase in the variance from 1970
to 2000 was quite similar across the entire distribution of unobserved ability. Figure 13(b) shows
that the overall variance decomposition when accounting for heteroskedasticity is quite similar to
our results in Figure 9(b) that assume all workers face the same distribution of shocks.

Conclusions
Studies that estimate the changing role of unobserved skills generally abstract from the changing

dynamics of earnings shocks, attributing changes in log earnings/wage residual distributions to the
evolution of unobserved skill pricing over time. A separate literature in labor and macroeconomics
estimates important changes in the variance of transitory and permanent shocks over the past few
decades; however, this literature typically neglects changes in unobserved skill prices.
We show that the distribution of unobserved skills and the evolution of skill pricing functions
can be separately identified from changing distributions of idiosyncratic permanent and transitory
shocks using panel data. Specifically, a panel of length T ≥ 6 + 3q is needed for full nonparametric
identification in the presence of permanent Martingale shocks and transitory shocks that follow

an M A(q) process. We then discuss a moment-based approach to estimating the distribution
of unobserved skills, changes in unobserved skill pricing functions, and the changing nature of
permanent and transitory shocks over time.
Using panel data from the PSID on male earnings in the U.S. from 1970-2008, we show that
accounting for time-varying unobserved skill prices is important for explaining the variances and
autocovariances of log earnings residuals over this period. Furthermore, accounting for variation
in the distributions of transitory and permanent shocks is important for identifying the evolution
of skill pricing functions. Using our estimates, we decompose the variance of log earnings residuals
over time into three components: the pricing of unobserved skills, permanent and transitory shocks.
Our results suggest little change in the variance of unobserved skills across cohorts born between
1925 and 1955; however, the pricing of unobserved skills changed substantially over time. There
was a sizeable increase in the returns to unobserved skill over the 1970s and early 1980s, but this
trend reversed itself in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the pricing of unobserved skills falling back
to what it was in 1970. From 1995 onward, unobserved skill prices were fairly stable (especially at
the top of the skill distribution). These patterns contrast sharply with time trends for the variance
of log earnings residuals, which rose sharply in the early 1980s, remained relatively stable over the
late 1980s and early 1990s, and then began rising again. The differences are due to important
changes in the variance of permanent and transitory shocks. In particular, the variance of earnings
residuals rose much more sharply in the early 1980s than the variance of unobserved skill prices due

32

to sizeable increases in the variance of both transitory and permanent shocks. While the variance
of transitory skills fluctuated up and down afterwards (without any obvious long-run trend), the
variance of permanent shocks continued to rise at a steady pace through the end of our sample
(especially for workers with low unobserved skill). Over the late 1980s and early 1990s, this increase
largely offset declines in the price of unobserved skills, leaving the total residual variance relatively
unchanged over a ten to fifteen year period. When the pricing of unobserved skills stabilized (at
least at the top of the skill distribution) in the mid-1990s, residual inequality rose along with the
variance of permanent shocks.
Our estimates of flexible skill pricing functions allow us to identify changes in the returns to
unobserved skill at different points in the distribution. Over the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s,
the returns to unobserved skill rose and fell by similar amounts throughout the skill distribution;
however, this was no longer true beginning in the mid-1990s. From 1995 on, we estimate very
little change in unobserved skill pricing functions over the top half of the distribution; however, the
value of unobserved skill declined over the bottom half of the distribution as earnings differences
between middle- and low-skilled workers narrowed. By the mid-2000s, skill pricing functions were
essentially flat over the entire bottom half of the distribution. These changes at the bottom are
broadly consistent with the skill polarization phenomenon emphasized by Acemoglu and Autor
(2011) and Autor and Dorn (2012); however, we find no evidence of an increase in the returns to
skill at the top of the distribution (as one would infer from looking at residuals themselves). An
important lesson from these findings is that changes in the distribution of log earnings residuals
are not necessarily informative about the evolution of unobserved skill pricing functions, especially
in recent decades.
It is difficult to reconcile current theories of skill-biased technical change with the broad trends
we estimate for the pricing of unobserved skills and the variance of permanent shocks. Many theories, motivated largely by CPS-based evidence, have sought to explain a long-run rise in unobserved
skill prices, but they offer little insight into the subsequent decline we observe. Theories based on
the slow diffusion of skill-biased technology in frictional labor markets are helpful for understanding the simultaneous increase in unobserved skill prices and in the variance of permanent shocks
(Violante, 2002), since skilled workers are more likely to adopt new technologies when they are
lucky enough to find employment at a firm that has upgraded. Yet, this suggests that an increase
in the variance of permanent shocks (i.e. the luck of matching with more cutting edge firms) should
be seen among higher skilled workers first, in contrast with our findings. Our results are likely to

33

be more consistent with a theory based on the introduction of new technologies that are adopted
broadly by skilled workers early on (i.e. the 1970s and early 1980s) but which then diffuse more
slowly (and randomly) to low-skilled workers (i.e. the late 1980s and 1990s). The faster rise in permanent shocks for less-skilled workers from the early 1980s on suggests that it may have taken time
for many of these workers to match with firms adopting newer technologies (due to labor market
frictions). This theory would also be consistent with the rising variance of wages paid across firms
as observed in Dunne et al. (2004) and Barth et al. (2011).

Technical Results

A.1

Proof of Lemma 1

Without loss of generality, we set T = 3. Assumption 1 implies Assumptions 1–5 in Hu and
Schennach (2008). The completeness assumption in condition (iii) is sufficient for injectivity. Therefore, we can apply their Theorem 1 by setting x∗ = θ, x = W1 , z = W2 , and y = W3 . The same
strategy is also adopted in Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2010) for identifying fθ (·). Given
additive separability in the model, we show that fεt (·) and µt (·) are also identified.
Theorem 1 in Hu and Schennach (2008) implies that when we have the joint density of (W1 , W2 , W3 ),
the equation
Z
fW3 ,W1 ,W2 (w3 , w1 , w2 ) =
Θ

fW1 |θ (w1 |θ)fW3 ,θ (w3 , θ)fW2 |θ (w2 |θ) dθ for all wt ∈ Wt

(13)

admits a unique solution (fW1 |θ , fW3 ,θ , fW2 |θ ). Since we already know the marginal distribution
fW3 , we can first identify fθ by integrating fW3 ,θ over W3 . Next, the functions µt (·) for t = 2, 3
are identified from conditional densities fWt |θ since we know that E[Wt |θ] = µt (θ) from E[εt |θ] =
E[εt ] = 0 . Finally, fεt is identified from fεt |θ (ε|θ) = fWt |θ (µt (θ) + ε) since both fWt |θ and µt (·) are
already known.

A.2

Proof of Theorem 1

Step 1: Identification of fθ (·) and µt (·) for all t.
In this step, we jointly consider distributions of (Wt , ∆Wt+3 , ∆Wt+6 ) for t = 1, 2, 3. Begin with the
following subset of equations:
W1 = θ + ε1 = θ + η1 + ν1 = θ + σ1 (θ)ζ1 + ν1
∆W4 = ∆µ4 (θ) + ∆ε4 = ∆µ4 (θ) + η4 + ∆ν4 = ∆µ4 (θ) + σ4 (θ)ζ4 + ∆ν4
∆W7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + ∆ε7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + η7 + ∆ν7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + σ7 (θ)ζ7 + ∆ν7 .
Assumption 2 (ii) implies that these triplets are mutually independent conditional on θ. Thus, the
problem simplifies to that of the serially independent case of Lemma 1. Therefore, we can identify
fθ (·), ∆µ4 (·), and ∆µ7 (·) from Lemma 1. As a by-product, we can also identify conditional density
functions fW1 |θ (·|·), f∆W4 |θ (·|·), and f∆W7 |θ (·|·), which will be used in Step 2.

35

Next we consider the second subset of equations:
W2 = µ2 (θ) + ε2 = θ2 + η1 + η2 + ν2
∆W5 = ∆µ5 (θ) + ∆ε5 = g5 (θ2 ) + η5 + ∆ν5
∆W8 = ∆µ8 (θ) + ∆ε8 = g8 (θ2 ) + η8 + ∆ν8 .
where θt ≡ µt (θ) and gt (θ2 ) is implicitly defined as ∆µt (θ) = gt (µ2 (θ)). We apply Lemma 1 again
to identify fθ2 (·), g5 (·), and g8 (·). Given monotonicity of all µt (·), we can recover the function µ2 (·)
by µ2 (θ) = Fθ−1
(Fθ (θ)). Once we identify µ2 (·), ∆µt (·) for t = 5, 8 are identified from ∆µt (θ) =
2
gt (µ2 (θ)). We apply the same argument to the set of equations composed of (W3 , ∆W6 , ∆W9 )
and identify µ3 (·), ∆µ6 (·), and ∆µ9 (·). Finally, we can recover all µt (·) sequentially from µt (·) =
∆µt (·) + µt−1 (·) for t = 4, . . . , 9.
Step 2: Identification of E[ξt2 ], βt , and σt (·) for t = 1, . . . , 7.
Consider the following three equations:
W1 = θ + κ1 + ν1 = θ + σ1 (θ)ζ1 + ν1
W2 = µ2 (θ) + κ2 + ν2 = µ2 (θ) +

Recall that we already know fθ (·), µt (·), and fWt |θ (·|·) for all t = 1, . . . , 7. First, by looking at
E [W1 W3 ] = E[θµ3 (θ)] + E[σ12 (θ)],
we can recover E[σ12 (θ)]. Second, we look at


E W12 = E[θ2 ] + E[σ12 (θ)] + E[ξ12 ],
to identify E[ξ12 ]. Third, we focus on
E [W1 W2 ] = E[θµ2 (θ)] + E[σ12 (θ)] + β1 E[ξ12 ],
which identifies β1 . Finally, σ1 (·) is identified from


E W12 |θ = θ2 + σ12 (θ) + E[ξ12 ].


1/2
Under the sign normalization, it is given by σ1 (θ) = E W12 |θ − θ2 − E[ξ12 ]
. Applying the
same logic to triplets {Wt , Wt+1 , Wt+2 }7t=2 , we can identify E[ξt2 ], βt , and σt (·) for all t = 2, . . . , 7.
36

Step 3: Identification of fηt (·) and fξt (·) for t = 1, . . . , 7.
Under the Carleman’s condition in Assumption 2 (vi), the infinite sequence of moments



E[ηtk ], E[ξtk ]

for t = 1, . . . , 7 determines {fηt (·), fξt (·)}7t=1 uniquely.32 We show that the infinite sequence of mo
 7
ments are identified by mathematical induction. Since we already know E[ζt2 ], E[ξt2 ] t=1 by the
normalization and Step 2, we now suppose that E[ζtk ] and E[ξtk ] are known for some k ≥ 2. It
remains to show that E[ζtk+1 ] and E[ξtk+1 ] are identified.
Consider the case of t = 1. We look at the following two moment conditions: E[W1k+1 ] and


E W1k W3 :
E[W1k+1 ] = E[σ1k+1 (θ)]E[ζ1k+1 ] + E[ξ1k+1 ] + C1
E[W1k W3 ] = E[σ1k+1 (θ)]E[ζ1k+1 ] + C2 ,
where two constants C1 and C2 can be calculated from known moments up to k. Also, note that
E[σ1k+1 (θ)] is known from σ1 (·) and fθ (·) and that E[σ1k+1 (θ)] is bounded above zero. Solving these
linear equation, we have
E[ζ1k+1 ] =

E[W1k W3 ] − C2
E[σ1k+1 (θ)]

E[ξ1k+1 ] = E[W1k+1 ] − E[W1k W3 ] − (C1 − C2 ).
By applying the same arguments over

n
o
E[Wtk+1 ], E[Wtk Wt+2 ] for t = 2, . . . , 7, we can identify

E[ζtk+1 ] and E[ξtk+1 ] for t = 2, . . . , 7.
The infinite sequence of moments

A.3

Identification under Homoskedasticity

We next provide our identification result under homoskedasticity without requiring strict monotonicity of ∆µt (·). The model is given by equation (3) with κt = κt−1 + ηt , νt = ξt + β1 ξt−1 , and
ηt and ξt independent of θ for all t. We assume the following conditions similar to Assumption 2.
Assumption 3. The following conditions hold for T = 9:
(i) The joint density of θ, W1 , W2 , W3 , ∆W4 , . . . , ∆W9 is bounded and continuous, and so are
all their marginal and conditional densities.
(ii) All unobserved components ηt , ξt , and θ are mutually independent for all t.
32
This is known as the Hamburger moment problem, and the Carleman’s condition is a sufficient condition for
identification of the distributions, e.g. see Shiryaev (1995), pp. 295–296.

(iii) fW1 |∆W4 (W1 |∆W4 ) and fθ|W1 (θ|W1 ) form a bounded complete family of distributions indexed
by ∆W4 and W1 , respectively. The same condition holds for (W2 , ∆W5 , θ2 ) and (W3 , ∆W6 , θ3 ).
(iv) For t = 7, 8, 9, the functions ∆µt (θ) are continuously differentiable with ∆µ0t (θ∗ ) = 0 for at
most a finite number of θ∗ . The density of θ, fθ (·), does not vanish in the neighborhood of θ∗ .
(v) We impose the following normalization: κ0 = ξ0 = 0, µ1 (θ) = θ, and E[ηt ] = E[ξt ] = 0, for
all t.
(vi) The characteristic functions of {Wt }9t=1 and {∆Wt }9t=4 do not vanish.
Conditions (i) and (iii) are the same as in Assumption 2. Condition (ii) assumes full independence of permanent and transitory shocks with θ, ruling out heteroskedasticity. Condition
(iv) allows for non-monotonic changes in unobserved skill pricing functions ∆µt (·), but it requires
that µt (·) is changing in later periods for all but a finite number of θ values. Condition (vi) is
a standard technical assumption. This alternative set of assumptions ensures identification under
homoskedasticity of the shocks.
Theorem 2. Under Assumption 3, fθ (·), {µt (·)}9t=1 , {fηt (·), fξt (·), βt }7t=1 are identified.
Proof of Theorem 2
We again prove this identification result in three steps.
Step 1: Identification of fθ (·) and µt (·) for all t.
In this step, we jointly consider distributions of (Wt , ∆Wt+3 , ∆Wt+6 ) for t = 1, 2, 3. These triplets
are mutually independent under Assumption 3 (ii). Begin with the following subset of equations:
W1 = θ + ε1 = θ + η1 + ν1
∆W4 = ∆µ4 (θ) + ∆ε4 = ∆µ4 (θ) + η4 + ∆ν4
∆W7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + ∆ε7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + η7 + ∆ν7 .
Note that, different from the baseline model (Lemma 1), Assumption 4 in Hu and Schennach (2008)
described above may not hold since the difference of two monotone functions, ∆µ7 (·), is not always
monotone. We consider two cases depending on the functional form of ∆µ7 (·).
First, consider the case of ∆µ7 (θ) = a + b ln(ecθ + d) for a, b, c(6= 0), d ∈ R. Then, for any θ̄ 6= θ̃,
we have ∆µ7 (θ̄) 6= ∆µ7 (θ̃) because both the logarithmic and exponential functions are strictly
monotone. Therefore, f∆W7 |θ (w|θ̄) 6= f∆W7 |θ (w|θ̃) for some w with positive probability, and we can
apply Lemma 1 to identify fθ , ∆µ4 (·) and ∆µ7 (·) as before.
38

Second, consider the case of ∆µ7 (θ) 6= a + b ln(ecθ + d). Then, we first apply Theorem 1 in
Schennach and Hu (2013) to the following pair of equations:
W1 = θ + ε 1
∆W7 = ∆µ7 (θ) + ∆ε7 .
Notice that Assumptions 1–6 in their paper are implied by Assumption 3 (i), (ii), (iv), and (v).
Therefore, we can identify the function ∆µ7 (·) and densities fθ (·), fε1 (·), f∆ε7 (·). To identify ∆µ4 (·),
we need some additional notation. Let LA|B be a linear operator defined as
Z
LA|B : G(B) 7→ G(A) with [LA|B g](·) ≡ fA|B (·|b)g(b)db,
where A is the support of a random variable A, and G(A) is the space of all bounded and absolutely
integrable functions supported on A. Simlarly, B and G(B) are defined. For any given ∆W7 = w7 ,
we also define


L∆W7 ;W1 |∆W4 : G(W4 ) 7→ G(W1 ) with L∆W7 ;W1 |∆W4 g (·) ≡

Z
f∆W7 ,W1 |∆W4 (w7 , ·|w4 )g(w4 )dw4

Λ∆W7 ;θ : G(Θ) 7→ G(Θ) with [Λ∆W7 ;θ g] (·) ≡ f∆W7 |θ (w7 , ·)g(·).
Using Assumption 3 (ii), we can rewrite the conditional density f∆W7 ,W1 |∆W4 as follows
Z
f∆W7 ,W1 |∆W4 (w7 , w1 |w4 ) = fW1 |θ (w1 |θ)f∆W7 |θ (w7 |θ)fθ|∆W4 (θ|w4 )dθ,
which is equivalent to
L∆W7 ;W1 |∆W4 = LW1 |θ Λ∆W7 ;θ Lθ|∆W4 .
By integrating over w7 , we have
LW1 |∆W4 = LW1 |θ Lθ|∆W4

(14)

Lθ|∆W4 = L−1
W1 |θ LW1 |∆W4 ,

(15)

where equation (15) is made possible from Assumption 3 (iii). Since we have already identified fε1
and ε1 is independent of θ, the conditional density fW1 |θ is identified from fW1 |θ (w1 |θ) = fε1 (w1 −θ).
Therefore, we know both terms on the right hand side of equation (15) and identify the density
fθ|∆W4 . Applying Bayes’ rule with known fθ and f∆W4 , we can identify f∆W4 |θ . Finally, ∆µ4 (·) is
recovered from f∆W4 |θ and E[∆ε4 |θ] = E[∆ε4 ] = 0.

39

Next, we consider the second subset of equations:
W2 = µ2 (θ) + ε2 = θ2 + η1 + η2 + ν2
∆W5 = ∆µ5 (θ) + ∆ε5 = g5 (θ2 ) + η5 + ∆ν5
∆W8 = ∆µ8 (θ) + ∆ε8 = g8 (θ2 ) + η8 + ∆ν8 .
where gt (θ2 ) is implicitly defined as ∆µt (θ) = gt (µ2 (θ)). We apply the same method described above
to identify fθ2 (·), g5 (·), and g8 (·). Then, we can recover the function µ2 (·) by µ2 (θ) = Fθ−1
(Fθ (θ)).
2
Once we identify µ2 (·), ∆µt (·) for t = 5, 8 are identified from ∆µt (θ) = gt (µ2 (θ)). We apply the
same argument to the set of equations composed of (W3 , ∆W6 , ∆W9 ) and identify µ3 (·), ∆µ6 (·), and
∆µ9 (·). Finally, we can recover all µt (·) sequentially from µt (·) = ∆µt (·) + µt−1 (·) for t = 4, . . . , 9.
Step 2: Identification of fηt (·) and fνt (·) for t = 1, . . . , 7.
Consider the following two equations:
W1 = θ + ε1 = θ + η1 + ν1
W3 = µ3 (θ) + ε3 = µ3 (θ) + η1 + η2 + η3 + ν3 ≡ µ3 (θ) + η1 + ν30
where ν30 = η2 + η3 + ν3 . Rearrange these equations as follows
W1 − θ = ε1 = η1 + ν1
W3 − µ3 (θ) = ε3 = η1 + ν30 .
We first show that the joint density of (ε1 , ε3 ) is identified. Note that
i
h
φW1 ,W3 (τ1 , τ3 ) = E e−i(τ1 W1 +τ3 W3 )
h
i
= E e−i(τ1 (θ+ε1 )+τ3 (µ3 (θ)+ε3 )

= E e−i(τ1 ε1 +τ3 ε3 ) E e−i(τ1 θ+τ3 µ3 (θ))
= φε1 ,ε3 (τ1 , τ3 )φθ,µ3 (θ) (τ1 , τ3 ).
The second to the last equality exploits the independence between (ε1 , ε3 ) and θ. Since both
φW1 ,W3 (τ1 , τ3 ) and φθ,µ3 (θ) (τ1 , τ3 ) are already identified, we can identify the joint density of (ε1 , ε3 )
from
φε1 ,ε3 (τ1 , τ3 ) =

φW1 ,W3 (τ1 , τ3 )
.
φθ,µ3 (θ) (τ1 , τ3 )

40

Next, η1 , ν1 , and ν30 are mutually independent. Therefore, we can identify fη1 (·) and fν1 (·), and
fν30 (·) by applying Lemma 1 in Kotlarski (1967). Applying this argument to (W2 , W4 ), . . . , (W7 , W9 )
sequentially, we can identify fηt (·) and fνt (·) for all t = 1, . . . , 7.
Step 3: Identification of fξt (·) and βt for t = 1, . . . , 7.
Finally, we identify all components of the transitory shock, νt = ξt + βt ξt−1 . Because of the
normalization ν1 = ξ1 , the distribution fξ1 (·) is identified by fξ1 (·) = fν1 (·) in Step 2. Next, we
identify β2 from
Cov(W1 , W2 ) = Cov (θ, µ2 (θ)) + V ar(η1 ) + β1 V ar(ξ1 ),
since we know all other terms except β1 . Therefore, unless V ar(ξ1 ) = 0, we can identify β1 . In
the above equation, note that all cross moments between unobservables are zero because of the
conditional mean zero assumption. For example,
Cov(µ2 (θ), η1 ) = E[µ2 (θ)η1 ] = Eθ [E[µ2 (θ)η1 |θ]] = Eθ [µ2 (θ)E[η1 |θ]] = 0
We next identify the distribution of ξ2 using the standard deconvolution method as
φξ2 (τ ) =

φν2 (τ )
,
φβ1 ξ1 (τ )

where φν2 (·) and φβ1 ξ1 (·) are identified. In the same way, we expand Cov(Wt , Wt+1 ) and identify
βt and fξt (·) sequentially for t = 2, . . . , 7. Again, we cannot identify the components of ν8 and ν9
unless we have additional observations.
Combining results from Steps 1–3, we establish the identification of fθ (·), {fηt (·), fξt (·), βt }7t=1 ,
and {µt (·)}9t=1 .

Additional Estimates
In this appendix, we report results from a number of alternative specifications, all assuming

linear µt (·). Unless otherwise noted, model assumptions are the same as those of subsection 5.1.
Consistent with the results of that subsection, we also use only variance and covariance moments
in estimation. We begin with an examination of the robustness of our results for log earnings
residuals, then consider results from our baseline specification for log weekly wage residuals.

the persistence attributed to ‘transitory’ shocks in the more general M A(3) and M A(5) models
effectively gets allocated to the permanent shock in the M A(1) specification. Estimated patterns
for the variance in unobserved skills prices are remarkably robust to assumptions about the process
for transitory shocks.

Using variance/covariance moments and assuming linear µt (·), we estimate this model assuming
βt = β for all t. Results from this model are reported in Table 2 along with analogous results
assuming time invariant pricing functions (i.e. µt (θ) = θ for all t).33 Figure 15 shows the variance
decomposition associated with these estimates (for time-varying µt (·)). As with the M A(1) and
M A(5) cases, the decomposition results are quite similar to those in Figure 5 of the paper.
B.1.2

Age-Dependent Variances of Permanent and Transitory Shocks

We next consider the possibility that the variance of transitory and permanent shocks may vary
with age. Specifically, we allow the variances of both ηa,t and ξa,t to be linear functions of age over
33

Notice that the ARM A(1, 1) specification has a slightly lower minimized objective function than does our baseline
M A(3) model. However, we cannot reject that adding an autoregressive component to the M A(5) model improves
the fit (at the 5% significance level). The minimized objective function for an ARM A(1, 5) is 114.1.

ages 20-35 and constant thereafter. Estimates imply that the variance of permanent shocks declines
by a total of 26% over these fifteen years, while the variance of transitory shocks declines by 24%.
The minimized objective function improves (insignificantly) to 118.5. The variance decomposition
shown in Figure 16 is quite similar to that of Figure 5 in the text.

B.2

Log Weekly Wage Residuals

Figure 17 shows the estimated variance decomposition for log weekly wage residuals using our
baseline specification with linear time-varying µt (·), an M A(3) process for νa,t , and homoskedastic
permanent shocks. This figure is quite similar to the analogous figure for log earnings residuals
(Figure 5). Estimated persistence of transitory shocks are also quite similar to those in column 6 of
Table 1 with β̂1 = 0.282 (0.028), β̂2 = 0.162 (0.021) and β̂3 = 0.124 (0.028). As with log earnings
residuals, accounting for time-varying µt (·) functions substantially improves the fit to the data.34

34

The minimized objective function is 85.65 for time varying µt (·) compared to 110.12 for time invariant µt (·).
