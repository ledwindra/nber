We build a non-representative agent intertemporal macroeconomic model that rationalizes this phenomenon as the equilibrium outcome of interaction between multiple groups that have common access to aggregate income.  We conclude by suggesting that institutional reform may hold the key to improving the cyclical behavior of savings in Latin America.\n\n",
