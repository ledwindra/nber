ABSTRACT
In recent decades, advances in information and communication technology and falling trade
barriers have led firms to retain within their boundaries and in their domestic economies only a
subset of their production stages. A key decision facing firms worldwide is the extent of control
to exert over the different segments of their production processes. We describe a property-rights
model of firm boundary choices along the value chain that generalizes Antràs and Chor (2013).
To assess the evidence, we construct firm-level measures of the upstreamness of integrated and
non-integrated inputs by combining information on the production activities of firms operating in
more than 100 countries with Input-Output tables. In line with the model's predictions, we find
that whether a firm integrates upstream or downstream suppliers depends crucially on the
elasticity of demand for its final product. Moreover, a firm's propensity to integrate a given stage
of the value chain is shaped by the relative contractibility of the stages located upstream versus
downstream from that stage, as well as by the firm's productivity. Our results suggest that
contractual frictions play an important role in shaping the integration choices of firms around the
world.

Introduction

Sequential production has been an important feature of modern manufacturing processes at least
since Henry Ford introduced his Model T assembly line in 1913. The production of cars, computers,
mobile phones and most other manufacturing goods involves a sequencing of stages: raw materials
are converted into basic components, which are then combined with other components to produce
more complex inputs, before being assembled into final goods.
In recent decades, advances in information and communication technology and falling trade
barriers have led firms to retain within their boundaries and in their domestic economies only a
subset of these production stages. Research and development, design, production of parts, assembly,
marketing and branding, previously performed in close proximity, are increasingly fragmented across
firms and countries. The semiconductor industry fittingly exemplifies these trends. The first
semiconductor chips were manufactured in the United States by vertically integrated firms such
as IBM and Texas Instruments. Firms initially kept the design, fabrication, assembly, and testing
of integrated circuits within ownership boundaries. The industry has since undergone several
reorganization waves in the last fifty years, and many of the production stages are now outsourced
to independent contractors in Asia (Brown and Linden, 2005). Another often cited example is
the iPhone: while its software and product design are done by Apple, most of its components are
produced by independent suppliers around the world (Xing, 2011).
While fragmenting production across firms and countries has become easier, contractual frictions remain a significant obstacle to the globalization of value chains. On top of the inherent
difficulties associated with designing richly contingent contracts, international transactions suffer
from a disproportionately low level of enforcement of contract clauses and legal remedies (Antràs,
2015). In such an environment, companies are presented with complex organizational decisions. In
this paper, we focus on a key decision faced by firms worldwide: the extent of control they choose
to exert over the different segments of their production processes.
Although the global fragmentation of production has featured prominently in the trade literature
(e.g., Johnson and Noguera, 2012), much less attention has been placed on how the position of a
given production stage in the value chain affects firm boundary choices, and firm organizational
decisions more broadly. Furthermore, most studies on this topic have been mainly theoretical in
nature.1 To a large extent, this theoretical bias is explained by the challenges one faces when taking
models of global value chains to the data. Ideally, researchers would like to access comprehensive
datasets that would enable them to track the flow of goods within value chains across borders and
organizational forms. Trade statistics are useful in capturing the flows of goods when they cross a
particular border, and some countries’ customs offices also record whether goods flow in and out
of a country within or across firm boundaries. Nevertheless, once a good leaves a country, it is

Recent papers on sequential production include Harms et al. (2012), Baldwin and Venables (2013), Costinot et
al. (2013), Antràs and Chor (2013), Kikuchi et al. (2014), and Fally and Hillberry (2014). This literature is in turn
inspired by earlier contributions in Dixit and Grossman (1982), Sanyal and Jones (1982), Kremer (1993), Yi (2003),
and Kohler (2004).

virtually impossible with available data sources to trace the subsequent locations (beyond its first
immediate destination) where the good will be combined with other components and services.
The first contribution of this paper is to show how available data on the activities of firms can
be combined with information from standard Input-Output tables to study firm boundaries along
value chains. A key advantage of this approach is that it allows us to study how the integration of
stages in a firm’s production process is shaped by the characteristics – in particular, the production
line position (or “upstreamness”) – of these different stages. Moreover, the richness of our data
allows us to run specifications that exploit variation in organizational features across firms, as
well as within firms across their various inputs. Available theoretical frameworks of sequential
production are highly stylized and often do not feature asymmetries across production stages other
than in their position along the value chain. A second contribution of this paper is to develop a
richer framework of firm behavior that can closely guide our firm-level empirical analysis.
On the theoretical side, we build on the property-rights model in Antràs and Chor (2013),
by generalizing it to an environment that accommodates differences across input suppliers along
the value chain on the technology and cost sides.2 We focus on the problem of a firm controlling
the production process of a final-good manufacturing variety, which is associated with a constant
price elasticity demand schedule. The production of the final good entails a large number of stages
that need to be performed in a predetermined order. The different stage inputs are provided by
suppliers, who undertake relationship-specific investments to make their components compatible
with those of other suppliers along the value chain. How these supplier investments are transformed
into quality-adjusted units of output of the final good is determined by a function that is isomorphic
to a constant elasticity of substitution technology, except for the sequential nature of production.
The setting is one of incomplete contracting, in the sense that contracts contingent on whether
components are compatible or not cannot be enforced by third parties. As a result, the division of
surplus between the final-good producer and each supplier is governed by bargaining, after a stage
has been completed and the firm has had a chance to inspect the input. The final-good producer
must decide which input suppliers (if any) to own along the value chain. As in Grossman and Hart
(1986), the integration of suppliers does not change the space of contracts available to the firm and
its suppliers, but it affects the relative bargaining power of these agents in their negotiations. A
key feature of our model of firm boundaries is that organizational decisions have spillovers along
the value chain because relationship-specific investments made by upstream suppliers affect the
incentives of suppliers in downstream stages.
Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the key predictions of Antràs and Chor (2013) continue to
hold in this richer environment with input asymmetries. In particular, a firm’s decision to integrate
upstream or downstream suppliers depends crucially on the relative size of the elasticity of demand
for its final good and the elasticity of substitution across production stages. When demand is elastic
or inputs are not particularly substitutable, inputs are sequential complements, in the sense that the

employed to study the organizational decisions of multinational firms. See Antràs (2015) for a comprehensive overview
of this literature.

marginal incentive of a supplier to undertake relationship-specific investments is higher, the larger
are the investments by upstream suppliers. In this case, the firm finds it optimal to integrate only
the most downstream stages, while contracting at arm’s length with upstream suppliers in order
to incentivize their investment effort. When instead demand is inelastic or inputs are sufficiently
substitutable, inputs are sequential substitutes, i.e., investments by upstream suppliers lower the
investment incentives of downstream suppliers. When this is the case, the firm would choose to
integrate relatively upstream stages, while engaging in outsourcing to downstream suppliers. While
the profile of marginal productivities and costs along the value chain does not detract from this
core prediction, it does shape the measure of stages (i.e., how many inputs) the firm ends up finding
optimal to integrate in both the complements and the substitutes cases.
We develop several extensions of the model that are relevant for our empirical analysis. First,
we map the asymmetries across inputs to differences in their inherent degree of contractibility.
We show that the propensity of a firm to integrate a given stage is shaped in subtle ways by the
contractibility of upstream and downstream stages. Intuitively, in production processes that feature
a high degree of contractibility among upstream relative to downstream inputs, firms need to rely
less on the organizational mode to counteract the distortions associated with inefficient investments
upstream. Hence, high levels of upstream contractibility tend to reduce the set of outsourced stages
when inputs are sequential complements, while reducing the set of integrated stages when inputs
are sequential substitutes.
Second, we incorporate heterogeneity across final good producers in their core productivity,
while introducing fixed costs of integrating suppliers, as in Antràs and Helpman (2004). With
these features, more productive firms would (ceteris paribus) integrate a larger number of inputs,
in both the complements and substitutes cases. This is because more productive firms find it
easier to amortize the fixed costs associated with integrating suppliers, and thus find it optimal to
integrate stages that smaller firms can only profitably outsource. This extension also suggests that
productivity differences within an industry should have a distinct effect on integration choices: more
productive firms should have a higher propensity to integrate downstream (relative to upstream)
suppliers when inputs are sequential substitutes, but a higher propensity to integrate upstream
(relative to downstream) suppliers when inputs are sequential complements.
Finally, we consider a scenario in which integration is infeasible for certain segments of the value
chain, for example, due to exogenous technological or regulatory factors. We show that even when
integration is sparse (as is the case in our data), the model’s predictions continue to describe firm
boundary choices for those inputs along the value chain over which integration is feasible.
To assess the validity of the model’s predictions, we employ the WorldBase dataset of Dun and
Bradstreet (D&B), which provides detailed establishment-level information for public and private
companies in many countries. For each establishment, the dataset reports a list of up to six
production activities. Establishments belonging to the same firm can be linked via information
on their global parent using a unique identifier (the DUNS number). Our main sample consists of
more than 300,000 manufacturing firms in 116 countries.

3

In our empirical analysis, we study the determinants of a firm’s propensity to integrate upstream
versus downstream inputs. To distinguish between integrated and non-integrated inputs, we rely
on the methodology of Fan and Lang (2000), combining information on firms’ reported activities
with Input-Output tables (see also Acemoglu et al., 2009; and Alfaro et al., 2016). To capture the
position of different inputs along the value chain, we compute a measure of the upstreamness of each
input i in the production of output j using U.S. Input-Output Tables. This extends the measure of
the upstreamness of an industry with respect to final demand from Fally (2012) and Antràs et al.
(2012) to the bilateral industry-pair level. To provide a test of the model, we exploit information
from WorldBase on the primary activity of each firm, and use estimates of demand elasticities from
Broda and Weinstein (2006), as well as measures of contractibility from Nunn (2007).
We first examine how firms’ organizational choices depend on the elasticity of demand for their
final good. In line with the first prediction of the model, we find that the higher the elasticity
of demand faced by the parent firm, the lower the average upstreamness of its integrated inputs
relative to the upstreamness of its non-integrated inputs. This result is illustrated in a simple
(unconditional) form in Figure 1, based on different quintiles of the parent firm’s elasticity of
demand. As seen in the left panel of the figure, the average upstreamness of integrated inputs
is much higher when the parent company belongs to an industry with a low demand elasticity
than when it belongs to one associated with a high demand elasticity. Conversely, the right panel
shows that the average upstreamness of non-integrated stages is greater the higher the elasticity of
demand faced by the parent’s final good.3

list of firm characteristics (e.g., size, age, employment, sales), using different measures of the demand
elasticity, as well as in different subsamples of firms (e.g., restricting to domestic firms, or to
multinationals). We also show that our results hold in specifications where the elasticity of demand
is replaced by the difference between this same elasticity and a proxy for the degree of input
substitutability associated with the firm’s production process. We reach a similar conclusion when
we exploit within-firm variation in integration patterns. In these specifications, we find that a firm’s
propensity to integrate is generally lower for more upstream inputs (consistent with the smaller
bars observed in the left panel relative to the right panel of Figure 1), and that the negative effect
of upstreamness on integration is disproportionately large for firms facing high demand elasticities.
We report two further empirical regularities that are strongly consistent with the model’s implications. First, we find that firms’ ownership decisions are shaped by the contractibility of upstream
versus downstream inputs: a greater degree of “upstream contractibility” increases the likelihood
that a firm integrates upstream inputs, when the firm faces a high elasticity of demand (i.e., in the
complements case); conversely, it increases the propensity to outsource upstream inputs, when the
firm’s demand elasticity is low (i.e., in the substitutes case). This is in line with the intuition that
greater upstream contractibility lowers a firm’s need to rely on decisions over organizational mode
to elicit the right incentives from suppliers positioned at early stages in the value chain.4 Second,
we find that more productive firms integrate more inputs in industries across all the demand elasticity quintiles. Moreover, more productive firms exhibit a higher propensity to integrate relatively
downstream (respectively, upstream) inputs when the elasticity of demand for their final product
is low (respectively, high).
This body of findings suggests that contractual frictions play a crucial role in shaping the
integration choices of firms around the world. Our empirical results – specifically the rich differential
effects observed in the complements and substitutes cases – are consistent with a view of integration
choices that is rooted in the property-rights approach to the theory of the firm, although we do not
rule out that these could possibly be rationalized by alternative theories (as we briefly discuss in
the concluding section). It is also useful to describe how our analysis relates to other recent work on
vertical linkages at the firm level. In an influential study, Atalay et al. (2014) find little evidence of
intrafirm shipments between related plants within the United States; they instead present evidence
indicating that firm boundaries are more influenced by the transfer of intangible inputs, than by the
transfer of physical goods. Our theoretical model is abstract enough to allow one to interpret the
sequential investments as resulting in either tangible or intangible transfers across establishments;
and our empirical analysis takes into account both manufacturing and non-manufacturing inputs
(including services). That said, due to the inherent difficulties of recording and measuring intangible
inputs, we believe that our empirical results speak more to the optimal provision of incentives
4

The somewhat counterintuitive positive effect of contractibility on integration is a recurrent result in the propertyrights literature. For instance, Baker and Hubbard (2004) document that improvements in the contracting environment in the trucking industry (through the use of on-board computers) led to more integrated asset ownership. In
international trade settings, Nunn and Trefler (2008), Defever and Toubal (2013), and Antràs (2015) have documented
a similar positive association between contractibility and vertical integration.

along sequential value chains involving tangible inputs. It is important to stress, however, that
our findings should not be interpreted as invalidating the intangibles hypothesis. In fact, we will
report some patterns in the data which are suggestive of an efficiency-enhancing role of the common
ownership of proximate product lines. Relatedly, our analysis suggests that intrafirm trade flows
are an imperfect proxy for the extent to which firms react to contractual insecurity by internalizing
particular stages of their global value chains. As the “sparse integration” extension of our model
shows, internalization decisions along value chains are consistent with an arbitrarily low level of
intrafirm trade relative to the overall transaction volume in these chains. This helps reconcile
our findings with those of Ramondo et al. (2016), who find that intrafirm trade between U.S.
multinationals and their affiliates abroad is highly concentrated among a small number of large
affiliates.
By conducting our analysis at the firm level, we are able to greatly improve upon the empirical
evidence provided in Antràs and Chor (2013), which was based on industry-level data on U.S.
intrafirm import shares and lacked direct information on the U.S. entity internalizing these foreign
purchases. Moreover, by extending the theory in several directions, we have generated a richer set
of predictions about firms’ boundary choices that we can bring to the data. Our work is closely
related to two contemporaneous papers with similar goals. Del Prete and Rungi (2015) employ a
dataset of about 4,000 multinational business groups to explore the correlation between the average
“downstreamness” of integrated affiliates (relative to final demand) and that of the parent firm itself
(also relative to final demand). They find that this correlation varies depending on the size of the
demand elasticity faced by the parent firm, in a manner reminiscent of the predictions in Antràs
and Chor (2013). Their work is however silent on the production line position of non-integrated
inputs and does not incorporate an industry-pair measure of the upstreamness of affiliates relative
to their parents. Luck (2014) reports corroborating evidence based on city-level evidence on the
export-import activities of processing firms in China, though his work adopts a value-added notion
of production line position (rather than one rooted in actual production staging). As insightful as
these contributions are, we view the empirical strategy developed in this paper as a more direct firmlevel test of the propositions of the theory. More generally, our paper is related to a recent empirical
literature testing various aspects of the property-rights theory of multinational firm boundaries.
This includes Antràs (2003), Yeaple (2006), Nunn and Trefler (2008, 2013), Corcos et al. (2013),
Defever and Toubal (2013), Dı́ez (2014), and Antràs (2015), among others.5
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model of firm
boundaries with sequential production and input asymmetries. Section 3 describes the data. Section
4 outlines our empirical methodology and presents our findings in detail. Section 5 concludes. The
appendices contain additional material related to both the theory and the empirical analysis.

Even more broadly, our work is related to the extensive empirical literature on firm boundaries, which is nicely
overviewed in Lafontaine and Slade (2007), and Bresnahan and Levin (2012).

Theoretical Framework

In this section, we develop our model of sequential production. We first describe a generalized
version of the model in Antràs and Chor (2013) that incorporates heterogeneity across inputs
beyond their position along the value chain. We then consider several extensions to derive additional
theoretical results and enrich the set of predictions that can be brought to the data.

2.1

Benchmark Model with Heterogeneous Inputs

We focus throughout on the problem of a firm seeking to optimally organize a manufacturing
process that culminates in the production of a finished good valued by consumers. The final good
is differentiated in the eyes of consumers and belongs to a monopolistically competitive industry
with a continuum of active firms, each producing a differentiated variety. Consumer preferences
over the industry’s varieties feature a constant elasticity of substitution, so that the demand faced
by the firm in question can be represented by:
q = Ap−1/(1−ρ) ,

(1)

where A > 0 is a term that the firm takes as given, and the parameter ρ ∈ (0, 1) is positively
related to the degree of substitutability across final-good varieties. The parameter A is allowed
to vary across firms in the industry (perhaps reflecting differences in quality), while the demand
elasticity 1/ (1 − ρ) is common for all firms in the sector. The latter assumption is immaterial
for our theoretical results, but will be exploited in the empirical implementation, where we rely
on sectoral estimates of demand elasticities. Given that we largely focus on the problem of a
representative firm, we abstain from indexing variables by firm or sector to keep the notation tidy.
Obtaining the finished product requires the completion of a unit measure of production stages.
These stages are indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], with a larger i corresponding to stages further downstream
and thus closer to the finished product. Denote by x(i) the value of the services of intermediate
inputs that the supplier of stage i delivers to the firm. Final-good production is then given by:
Z
q=θ

1

1/α
(ψ (i) x(i)) I (i) di
,
α

(2)

0

where θ is a productivity parameter, α ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter that captures the (symmetric) degree
of substitutability among the stage inputs, the shifters ψ (i) reflect asymmetries in the marginal
product of different inputs’ investments, and I (i) is an indicator function that takes a value of 1
if input i is produced after all inputs i0 < i have been produced, and a value of 0 otherwise. The
technology in (2) resembles a conventional symmetric CES production function with a continuum
of inputs, but the indicator function I (i) makes the production technology inherently sequential.6
6

In fact, one can show that equation (2) can alternatively be expressed recursively, with value added at each stage
i being a Cobb-Douglas function of the volume of production q (i) generated up to that stage and stage-i’s input
services ψ (i) x(i).

7

Intermediate inputs are produced by a unit measure of suppliers, with the mapping between
inputs and suppliers being one-to-one. Inputs are customized to make them compatible with the
needs of the firm controlling the finished product. In order to provide a compatible input, the
supplier of input i must undertake a relationship-specific investment entailing a marginal cost of
c(i) per unit of input services x (i). All agents including the firm are capable of producing subpar
inputs at a negligible marginal cost, but these inputs add no value to final-good production apart
from allowing the continuation of the production process in situations in which a supplier threatens
not to deliver his or her input to the firm.
If the firm could discipline the behavior of suppliers via a comprehensive ex-ante contract, those
threats would be irrelevant. For instance, the firm could demand the delivery of a given volume
x (i) of input services in exchange for a fee, while including a clause in the contract that would
punish the supplier severely when failing to honor this contractual obligation. In practice, however,
a court of law will generally not be able to verify whether inputs are compatible or not, and whether
the services provided by compatible inputs are in accordance with what was stipulated in a written
contract. For the time being, we will make the stark assumption that none of the aspects of input
production can be specified in a binding manner in an initial contract, except for a clause stipulating
whether the different suppliers are vertically integrated into the firm or remain independent.
Because the terms of exchange between the firm and the suppliers are not set in stone before
production takes place, the actual payment to a particular supplier (say the one controlling stage
i) is negotiated bilaterally only after the stage i input has been produced and the firm has had
a chance to inspect it. At that point, the firm and the supplier negotiate over the division of
the incremental contribution to total revenue generated by supplier i. Notice that the lack of an
enforceable contract implies that suppliers are free to choose the volume of input services x (i) to
maximize their profits conditional on the value of the semi-finished good they are handed by their
immediate upstream supplier.
How does integration affect the game played between the firm and the unit measure of suppliers?
Following the property-rights theory of firm boundaries, we let the effective bargaining power of
the firm vis-à-vis a particular supplier depend on whether the firm owns this supplier. Under
integration, the firm controls the physical assets used in the production of the input, thus allowing
the firm to dictate a use of these assets that tilts the division of surplus in its favor. We capture this
central insight of the property-rights theory in a stark manner, with the firm obtaining a share β V
of the value of supplier i’s incremental contribution to total revenue when the supplier is integrated,
while receiving only a share β O < β V of that surplus when the supplier is a stand-alone entity.
This concludes the description of the assumptions of the model. Figure 2 outlines the timing
of events of the game played by the firm and the unit measure of suppliers. Antràs and Chor
(2013) provide an extensive discussion of the robustness of their key results should ex-ante transfers
between the firm and the suppliers be allowed, and under alternative bargaining protocols that allow
supplier i to lay claim over part of the revenues that are realized downstream of i. Although a
similar robustness analysis could be carried out in this current richer framework, we will abstain

8

from doing so due to space constraints.

and sold to consumers

Despite the presence of additional sources of input asymmetries, captured by the functions ψ (i)
and c(i), the subgame perfect equilibrium of the above game can be derived in a manner similar to
Antràs and Chor (2013). We begin by noting that, if all suppliers provide compatible inputs and
the correct technological sequencing of production is followed, equations (1) and (2) imply that the
total revenue obtained by the firm is given by r (1), where the function r (m) is defined by:
r (m) = A

Because the firm can always unilaterally complete a production stage by producing a subpar input
at negligible cost, one can interpret r (m) as the revenue secured up to stage m.
Now consider the bargaining between the firm and the supplier at stage m. Because inputs
are customized to the needs of the firm, the supplier’s outside option at the bargaining stage is 0
and the quasi-rents over which the firm and the supplier negotiate are given by the incremental
contribution to total revenue generated by supplier m at that stage. Applying Leibniz’ rule to (3),
this is given by:
r0 (m) =

ρ−α
α
ρ
A1−ρ θρ ρ r(m) ρ ψ (m)α x(m)α .
α

(4)

As explained above, in the bargaining, the firm captures a share β (m) ∈ {β V , β O } of r0 (m),
while the supplier obtains the residual share 1 − β (m). It then follows that the choice of input
volume x(m) is characterized by the program:

x∗ (m) = arg max (1 − β (m))
A1−ρ θρ ρ r (m) ρ ψ (m)α x(m)α − c (m) x(m) .

(5)

Notice that the marginal return to investing in x (m) is increasing in the demand level A, while
it decreases in the marginal cost c(m). Furthermore, this marginal return is increasing in supplier
9

m’s bargaining share 1 − β (m), and thus, other things equal, outsourcing provides higher-powered
incentives for the supplier to invest. This is a standard feature of property-rights models. The more
novel property of program (5) is that a supplier’s marginal return to invest at stage m is shaped
by all investment decisions in prior stages, i.e., {x(i)}m
i=0 , as captured by the value of production
secured up to stage m, i.e., r (m). The nature of such dependence is in turn crucially shaped by the
relative size of the demand elasticity parameter ρ and the input substitutability parameter α. When
ρ > α, investment choices are sequential complements in the sense that higher investment levels by
upstream suppliers increase the marginal return of supplier m’s own investment. Conversely, when
ρ < α, investment choices are sequential substitutes because high values of upstream investments
reduce the marginal return to investing in x(m). We shall refer to ρ > α as the complements case
and to ρ < α as the substitutes case, as in Antràs and Chor (2013).
It is intuitively clear why low values of α will tend to render investments sequential complements.
Why might a low value of ρ render investments sequential substitutes? The reason for this is that
when ρ is low, the firm’s revenue function is highly concave in output and thus marginal revenue
falls at a relatively fast rate along the value chain. As a result, the incremental contribution to
revenue associated with supplier m – which is what the firm and supplier m bargain over – might
be particularly low when upstream suppliers have invested large amounts.
We now plug the first-order condition from (5) into (4), and solve the resulting separable differential equation. As shown in Section A-1 of the Online Appendix, one can express the equilibrium
volume of input m services x∗ (m) as a function of the whole path of bargaining shares {β (i)}i∈[0,m]

It is then straightforward to see that

x∗ (m)

> 0 for all m as long as β (m) < 1. This in turn

implies that the firm has every incentive to abide by the proper (or technological) sequencing of
production, so that I ∗ (m) = 1 for all m (consistent with our expressions above).
To complete the description of the equilibrium, we roll back to the initial period prior to any production taking place, in which the firm decides whether the contract associated with a given input
m is associated with integration or outsourcing. This amounts to choosing {β (i)}i∈[0,1] to maximize

Notice that the term inside the square brackets is a monotonically increasing function of m. Expression (10) thus confirms the claim in Antràs and Chor (2013) that whether the optimal division
of surplus increases or decreases along the value chain is shaped critically by the relative size of
the parameters α and ρ.7 In the complements case (ρ > α), the incentive to integrate suppliers
increases as we move downstream in the value chain. Intuitively, given sequential complementarity,
the firm is particularly concerned about incentivizing upstream suppliers to raise their investment
effort, in order to generate positive spillovers on the investment levels of downstream suppliers.
Instead, in the substitutes case (ρ < α), the firm is less concerned with underinvestment by upstream suppliers, while capturing rents upstream is particularly appealing when marginal revenue
falls quickly with output.
A remarkable feature of equation (10) is that the slope of ∂β ∗ (m) /∂m is governed by the sign
of ρ − α regardless of the paths of ψ (k) and c (k). It is worth pausing to explain why this result
is not straightforward. Notice that a disproportionately high value of ψ (m) at a given stage m
can be interpreted as that stage being relatively important in the production process. Indeed, in
a model with complete contracts, the share of m in the total input purchases of the firm would
be a monotonically increasing function of ψ (m). According to one of the canonical results of
the property-rights literature, one would then expect the incentive to outsource such a stage to
be particularly large (see, in particular, Proposition 1 in Antràs, 2014). Intuitively, outsourcing
provides higher-powered incentives to suppliers, and minimizing underinvestment inefficiencies is
7

Although Antràs and Chor (2013) considered a variant of their model with heterogeneity in ψ (i) and c (i), they
failed to derive this explicit formula for β ∗ (m) and simply noted that ∂β ∗ (m) /∂m inherited the sign of ρ − α (see,
in particular, equation (28) in their paper).

11

particularly beneficial for inputs that are relatively important in production. In terms of the
notation of the model, one might have thus expected the optimal division of surplus β ∗ (m) to be
decreasing in stage m’s importance ψ (m). For the same reason, and given that input shares are
monotonically decreasing in the marginal cost c (m), one might have also expected the share β ∗ (m)
to be increasing in c (m). As intuitive as this reasoning might appear, one would be led to conclude
that if the path of ψ (m) were sufficiently increasing in m – or the path of c (m) were sufficiently
decreasing in m – then β ∗ (m) would tend to decrease along the value chain, particularly when the
difference between ρ and α is small.
Equation (10) demonstrates, however, that this line of reasoning is flawed. No matter by how
little ρ and α differ, the slope of β ∗ (m) is uniquely pinned down by the sign of ρ − α, regardless
of the paths of ψ (m) and c (m). This result bears some resemblance to the classic result in
consumption theory that an agent’s dynamic utility-maximizing level of consumption should be
growing or declining over time according to whether the real interest rate is greater or smaller
than the rate of time preference, regardless of the agent’s income path. It is important to stress,
however, that the paths of ψ (m) and c (m) are not irrelevant for the incentive to integrate suppliers
along the value chain (in the same manner that the path of income is not irrelevant in the dynamic
consumption problem). Equation (10) illustrates that the incentives to integrate a particular input
will be notably shaped by the size of the ratio ψ (k) /c (k) for inputs upstream from input m relative
to the average size of this ratio along the whole value chain.
More specifically, in production processes featuring sequential complementarity, the higher is
the value of ψ (k) /c (k) for inputs upstream from m relative to its value for inputs downstream from
m, the higher will be the incentive of the firm to integrate stage m. The intuition behind this result
is as follows. Remember that when inputs are sequential complements, the marginal incentive of
supplier m to invest will be higher, the higher are the levels of investment by suppliers upstream
from m. Furthermore, fixing the ownership structure, these upstream investments will also tend to
be relatively large whenever stages m0 upstream from m are associated with disproportionately large
values of ψ (m0 ) or low values of c (m0 ). In those situations, and due to sequential complementarity,
the incentives to invest at stage m will also tend to be disproportionately large, and thus the
incentive of the firm to outsource stage m will be reduced relative to a situation in which the
ratio ψ (k) /c (k) is common for all stages. Conversely, whenever ρ < α, investments are sequential
substitutes, and thus high upstream investments related to disproportionately high upstream values
of ψ (m0 ) /c (m0 ) for m0 < m will instead increase the likelihood that stage m is outsourced.
So far, we have focused on a characterization of the optimal bargaining share β ∗ (m), but the
above results can easily be turned into statements regarding the propensity of firms to integrate
(β ∗ (m) = β V ) or outsource (β ∗ (m) = β O ) the different stages along the value chain. In particular,
in Section A-1 of the Online Appendix, we show that:
Proposition 1. In the complements case (ρ > α), there exists a unique m∗C ∈ (0, 1], such that:
(i) all production stages m ∈ [0, m∗C ) are outsourced; and (ii) all stages m ∈ [m∗C , 1] are integrated
within firm boundaries. In the substitutes case (ρ < α), there exists a unique m∗S ∈ (0, 1], such
12

that: (i) all production stages m ∈ [0, m∗S ) are integrated within firm boundaries; and (ii) all stages
m ∈ [m∗S , 1] are outsourced. Furthermore, both m∗C and m∗S are lower, the higher is the ratio
ψ (m) /c (m) for upstream inputs relative to downstream inputs.

Figure 3 illustrates the main result in Proposition 1 concerning the optimal pattern of ownership
along the value chain. When the demand faced by the final-good producer is sufficiently elastic,
then there exists a unique cutoff stage such that all inputs prior to that cutoff are outsourced, and
all inputs (if any) downstream of it are integrated. The converse prediction holds when demand
is sufficiently inelastic (i.e., in the sequential substitutes case): the firm would instead integrate
relatively upstream inputs, while outsourcing would take place relatively downstream.
Although the last statement in Proposition 1 follows pretty immediately from our discussion of
the properties of the solution β ∗ (m) to the relaxed problem, it can also be shown more directly
by explicitly characterizing the thresholds m∗C and m∗S . For the sequential complements case, we
show in Section A-1 of the Online Appendix that, provided that integration and outsourcing coexist
along the value chain, the threshold m∗C is given by:

Notice then that the larger the value of ψ (k) /c (k) in upstream production stages (in the numerator
of the left-hand side) relative to downstream production stages, the lower will be the value of m∗C ;
the set of integrated stages will thus be larger.8 (The analogous expression for m∗S in the substitutes
case is reported in Section A-1 of the Online Appendix.)

In this section, we develop three extensions of our framework to further guide the firm-level empirical
analysis conducted later in this paper.

A. Heterogeneous Contractibility of Inputs
So far, we have been agnostic about the underlying drivers of input heterogeneity in the model. In
order to develop empirical tests of Proposition 1 – and especially its last statement – it is important
to map variation in the ratio ψ (m) /c (m) along the value chain to certain observables. With that
in mind, in this section we explore the link between ψ (m) and the degree of contractibility of
different stage inputs. In Section A-1 of the Online Appendix, we also briefly relate marginal cost
variation in c (m) along the value chain to the sourcing location decisions of the firm.9
Remember that in our benchmark model, x (m) captures the services related to the noncontractible aspects of input production, in the sense that the volume x (m) cannot be disciplined
via an initial contract and is chosen unilaterally by suppliers. Conversely, we shall now assume
that ψ (m) encapsulates investments and other aspects of production that are specified in the initial contract in a way that precludes any deviation from that agreed level. In light of equation (2),
our assumptions imply that input production is a symmetric Cobb-Douglas function of contractible
and non-contractible aspects of production. To capture differential contractibility along the value
chain, we let stages differ in the (legal) costs associated with specifying these contractible aspects
of production. More specifically, we denote these contracting costs by (ψ (m))φ /µ (m) per unit of
ψ (m). We shall refer to µ (m) as the level of contractibility of stage m.10 The parameter φ > 1
captures the intuitive notion that it becomes increasingly costly to render additional aspects of
production contractible. We shall assume that the firm bears the full cost of these contractible
investments (perhaps by compensating suppliers for them upfront), but our results would not be
affected if the firm bore only a fraction of these costs. To simplify matters, we let the marginal cost
c (m) of non-contractible investments be constant along the value chain, i.e., c (m) = c for all m.
In terms of the timing of events summarized in Figure 2, notice that nothing has changed except
for the fact that the initial contract also specifies the profit-maximizing choice of ψ (m) along the
value chain. Furthermore, once the levels of ψ (m) have been set at stage t0 , the subgame perfect
equilibrium is identical to that in our previous model in which ψ (m) was assumed exogenous. This
implies that the firm’s optimal ownership structure along the value chain will seek to maximize the
program in (7), and the solution of this problem will be characterized by Proposition 1.
As shown in Section A-1 of the Online Appendix, after solving for the optimal choice of β (m) ∈
{β V , β O }, one can express firm profits net of contracting costs as:

In the absence of contractual frictions, ψ (m) /c (m) would be positively related to the relative use of input m in
the production of the firm’s good, and one could presumably use information from Input-Output tables to construct
empirical proxies for this ratio. Unfortunately, such a mapping between ψ (m) /c (m) and input m’s share in the total
input purchases of firms is blurred by incomplete contracting and sequential production.
10
Acemoglu et al. (2007) also model input production as involving a Cobb-Douglas function of contractible and
non-contractible inputs, but they capture the degree of contractibility by the elasticity of input production to the
contractible components of production. In our setup with sequential production, however, such an approach precludes
an analytical solution of the differential equations characterizing the equilibrium.

The choice of the profit-maximizing path of ψ (i) will thus seek to maximize π̃ F in (12).
A notable feature of equation (12) is that, leaving aside variation in the costs of contracting µ (i),
the marginal incentive to invest in the contractible components of input production is independent
of the position of the input in the value chain. This result is not entirely intuitive because, relative
to a complete contracting benchmark, the degree of underinvestment in non-contractible inputs
varies along the value chain and the endogenous (but coarse) choice of ownership structure does
not fully correct these distortions. One might have then imagined that the choice of ψ (i) would
have partly sought to remedy these remaining inefficiencies. Instead, variation in the firm’s choice
of contractible investments ψ (i) is solely shaped by variation in contractibility µ (i). More precisely,
the first-order conditions associated with problem (12) imply that for any two inputs at stages m
and m0 , we have:

For the second-order conditions of problem (12) to be satisfied, we need to assume that φ >
α/ (1 − α), and thus the path of ψ (m) along the value chain is inversely related to the path of the
exogenous contracting costs 1/µ (m).11 In light of our discussion in the last section, this implies:
Proposition 2. There exist thresholds m∗C ∈ (0, 1] and m∗S ∈ (0, 1] such that, in the complements
case, all production stages m ∈ [0, m∗C ) are outsourced and all stages m ∈ [m∗C , 1] are integrated,
while in the substitutes case, all production stages m ∈ [0, m∗S ) are integrated, while all stages m ∈
[m∗S , 1] are outsourced. Furthermore, both m∗C and m∗S are lower, the higher is the contractibility
µ (m) for upstream inputs relative to downstream inputs.
Figure 4 illustrates the key result of Proposition 2. Intuitively, the higher the contractibility
of upstream inputs, the less firms need to rely on upstream organizational decisions as a way to
counteract the distortions associated with inefficient investments by upstream suppliers. Consequently, high levels of upstream contractibility tend to reduce the set of outsourced stages whenever
final-good demand is elastic or inputs are not too substitutable, while they tend to reduce the set
of integrated stages whenever final-good demand is inelastic or inputs are highly substitutable.

The inequality φ > α/ (1 − α) is necessary but not sufficient for the second-order conditions to be satisfied (see

By mapping variation in ψ (m) to the degree of input contractibility, Proposition 2 helps operationalize our previous Proposition 1. More specifically, in our empirical analysis, we will employ
proxies for input contractibility to develop a sector-level measure of the extent to which noncontractibilities feature disproportionately in upstream versus downstream stages in the production
of that sector’s output. We will then study how firm-level ownership decisions are shaped by this
relative importance of upstream versus downstream contractibilities in both the complements and
substitutes cases.
B. Heterogeneous Productivity of Final Good Producers
Our model incorporates heterogeneity across final good producers in terms of their demand level
A and their core productivity θ. In this section, we show how such heterogeneity shapes firm
boundary choices along the value chain, in the presence of fixed organizational costs associated
with vertically integrating production stages. More specifically, we shall now assume that if a firm
wants to integrate a given stage i ∈ [0, 1], it needs to pay a fixed cost equal to fV > 0.12
In order to facilitate a swifter transition to the empirical analysis, we shall revert back to our
benchmark model with exogenous paths of ψ (i) and c (i). We will relegate most mathematical
details to Section A-1 of the Online Appendix, in which we show that Proposition 1 continues
to apply in an environment with fixed costs of integration. More precisely, there continue to
exist thresholds m∗C ∈ (0, 1] and m∗S ∈ (0, 1] such that all production stages m ∈ [0, m∗C ) are
outsourced and all stages m ∈ [m∗C , 1] are integrated in the complements case, while all production
stages m ∈ [0, m∗S ) are integrated and all stages m ∈ [m∗S , 1] are outsourced in the substitutes case.
Furthermore, one can still show that both m∗C and m∗S are lower, the higher is the ratio ψ (m) /c (m)
for upstream inputs relative to downstream inputs.
These characterization results can be obtained even though the equations determining the cutoffs m∗C and m∗S are now significantly more involved. For instance, m∗C is now the solution to the
following implicit function:

More relevant for the purposes of this section, the equilibrium conditions defining m∗C and m∗S
can also be used to study how these thresholds are affected by changes in A and θ. Invoking
12

Our results below would continue to hold in the presence of fixed costs fO associated with outsourcing stages, as
long as those fixed costs are lower than fV .

16

the second-order condition associated with m∗C , we can establish that the left-hand side of (14) is
increasing in m∗C , and thus this threshold is necessarily a decreasing function of the level of firm
demand A or firm productivity θ. Following analogous steps, in Section A-1 of the Online Appendix
we show that, in the substitutes case, m∗S is instead increasing in both A and θ. In words, this
implies that regardless of the sign of ρ − α, relatively more productive firms will tend to integrate
a larger interval of production stages. The intuition behind this is simple: more productive firms
find it easier to amortize the fixed cost associated with integrating more stages.
In our empirical analysis, we will explore whether the observed intra-industry heterogeneity in
integration choices is in accordance with these predictions, which we summarize as:
Proposition 3. In the presence of fixed costs of integration, the statements in Proposition 1
continue to hold. Furthermore, the cutoff m∗C is decreasing in firm-level demand A and firm-level
productivity θ, while m∗S is increasing in A and θ.

Figure 5 illustrates how an increase in the productivity θ of the final good producer (or an
increase in firm-level demand A) affects integration choices along the value chain. The interval of
integrated stages expands in both cases, but in a manner that would lead us to observe relatively
more internalization of upstream stages when inputs are sequential complements, and conversely
relatively more internalization of downstream stages in the substitutes case.
C. Sparse Integration and Intrafirm Trade
Our framework has the strong implication that the sets of integrated and outsourced stages are
both connected and jointly constitute a partition of [0, 1]. As might have been expected, this
strong prediction of the model is not borne out in the data. In fact, integrated stages are very
sparse in our dataset and the overwhelming majority of them “border” with outsourced stages
immediately upstream and downstream from them.13 This paucity of integration might be due to
technological or regulatory factors that make vertical integration infeasible for certain production
stages. We next briefly outline a third extension of our model that accommodates such sparsity,
13
For our full sample of firms, the median number of integrated stages is 2, while the median number of nonintegrated stages – i.e., all inputs with positive total requirements coefficients – is 906. Even when restricting the
sample to the top 100 manufacturing inputs ranked by the total requirements coefficients of the associated output
industry, a mere 0.11 percent of all integrated stages are immediately preceded or succeeded by another integrated
stage. In the next section, we will discuss in detail how we identify integrated and non-integrated stages, and their
position in the value chain.

17

and we demonstrate that it does not undermine the validity of the key predictions of the model
that we will take to the data.
A simple way to render integration infeasible for certain segments of the value chain is to
assume that the fixed costs of integrating those segments is arbitrarily large. In terms of our
second extension above, we thus now have that the fixed cost of integration is stage-specific and
takes a value of fV (m) = +∞ for any m ∈ Υ, where Υ is the set of stages that cannot possibly
be integrated. For simplicity, we assume that the fixed costs of integration are finite and identical
for all remaining stages, so fV (m) = fV for m ∈ Ω, where Ω is the set of integrable stages (i.e.,
Ω = [0, 1] \Υ). Clearly, by making the set Υ larger and larger, one can make integration decisions
arbitrarily sparse in our model. As we show in Section A-1 of the Online Appendix, despite the
presence of the exogenously non-integrable stages, we can establish that:
Proposition 4. If ρ > α, the firm cannot possibly find it optimal to integrate a positive measure
of stages located upstream from a positive measure of outsourced stages (m̃, m̃ + ε) ∈ Ω that could
have been integrated. If ρ < α, the firm cannot possibly find it optimal to integrate a positive
measure of stages located downstream from a positive measure of outsourced stages (m̃, m̃ + ε) ∈ Ω
that could have been integrated.
Naturally, Proposition 4 provides a much weaker characterization of the integration decisions
of firms along their value chain than our previous Propositions 1-3. Yet, a corollary of Proposition
4 is that, holding constant the set Υ of stages that cannot possibly be integrated, the average
upstreamness of integrated stages relative to the average upstreamness of outsourced stages should
be lower when ρ > α than when ρ < α. This relative upstreamness of integrated and non-integrated
stages is what we refer to as “ratio-upstreamness” in our regression analysis, and will be one of the
key metrics employed to assess the empirical validity of the model.
An interesting implication of the sparsity of integrated stages in the value chain is that, as
the set Υ expands, the volume of intrafirm trade in the value chain becomes smaller and smaller.
Intuitively, in such a case, each interval of integrated stages becomes increasingly isolated, and
necessarily trades at arm’s length with their immediate “neighbors” in the value chain. This
confirms our claim in the Introduction that in sequential production processes in which physical
goods flow through both integrated and non-integrated plants, and in which the former are largely
outnumbered by the latter, the volume of intrafirm trade flows may be a poor proxy of the extent
to which firms’ integration decisions are shaped by contractual incompleteness.

Dataset and Key Variables

We turn now to our empirical analysis. We aim to measure the relative propensity of firms to
integrate or outsource inputs at different positions in the value chain. For that purpose, we need
firm-specific information on integrated and outsourced inputs, as well as a measure of the “upstreamness” of these various inputs. To assess the validity of our model, we also require proxies
for whether a final-good industry falls into the complements or substitutes case, and a measure of
18

input contractibility. In this section, we discuss the dataset that we employ to identify integrated
inputs, together with the construction of several key variables.

Our core firm-level dataset is Dun & Bradstreet’s (D&B) WorldBase, which provides comprehensive
coverage of public and private companies across more than 100 countries and territories. WorldBase
has been used extensively in the literature, in particular to explore research questions related to
the organizational practices of firms around the world.14 Cross-country studies at the firm level
are challenging, as there are few high-quality datasets that are comparable across countries; when
such data are available, these tend to be limited to advanced countries. One of the advantages of
WorldBase is thus the inclusion of a wide set of countries at different levels of development.15
Another key advantage is that the unit of observation is the establishment, namely a single
physical location where industrial operations or services are performed, or business is conducted.
Each establishment in WorldBase is assigned a unique identifier, called a DUNS number.16 Where
applicable, the DUNS number of the global ultimate owner is also reported, which allows us to
keep track of ownership linkages within the dataset. In addition, WorldBase provides information
on: (i) the location (address) of each establishment; (ii) the 4-digit SIC code (1987 version) of its
primary industry, and the SIC codes of up to five secondary industries; (iii) the year it was started
or in which current ownership took control; and (iv) basic data on employment and sales.
Note that each firm in the data is either: (i) a single-establishment firm; or (ii) is identified
in WorldBase as a “global ultimate”. The former refers to a business entity whose entire activity
is in one location, and which does not report ownership links with other establishments in WorldBase. For the latter, D&B WorldBase defines a “global ultimate” to be the top, most important,
responsible entity within a corporate family tree, that has more than 50% ownership of other establishments. We link each global ultimate to all its identified majority-owned subsidiaries, both
in manufacturing and non-manufacturing, by using the DUNS number of the global ultimate that
is reported for establishments. The set of integrated SIC activities for a single-establishment plant
is simply the list of up to six SIC codes associated with it. The set of integrated SIC codes for a
global ultimate is the complete list of SIC activities that is performed either in its headquarters or
by one of its subsidiaries. Moving forward, we will refer simply to each observation as a “parent”
firm, indexed by p.
14

An early example was Caves’ (1975) analysis of size and diversification patterns between Canadian and U.S.
plants. More recent uses include Harrison et al. (2004), Acemoglu et al. (2009), Alfaro and Charlton (2009), Alfaro
and Chen (2014), Fajgelbaum et al. (2015), and Alfaro et al. (2016).
15
The data in WorldBase is compiled from a large number of underlying sources, including partner firms, business
registers, telephone directory records, company websites, and even self-registration. See Alfaro and Charlton (2009)
for a more detailed discussion, and comparisons with other data sources such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA) data on U.S. multinational activity.
16
D&B uses the United States Government Department of Commerce, Office of Management and Budget, Standard
Industrial Classification Manual 1987 edition to classify business establishments. The Data Universal Numbering
System – the D&B DUNS Number – supports the linking of plants and firms across countries, and tracking of plants’
histories including name changes.

19

For our analysis, we use the 2004/2005 WorldBase vintage and focus on parent firms in the
manufacturing sector – i.e., whose primary SIC code lies between 2000 and 3999 – with a minimum total employment (across all establishments) of 20. To be clear, while each parent firm in
our sample has a primary SIC code in manufacturing, we nevertheless include all the parent firm’s
integrated SIC activities (both in manufacturing and non-manufacturing) in the exercise that follows. In all, our sample contains 320,254 parent firms from 116 countries; 259,312 of these are
single-establishment firms, while 60,942 are global ultimates. Among the global ultimates, 6,370
observations have subsidiaries in more than one country, and are thus multinational firms. Panel
A of Table A-1 in the Online Appendix provides some descriptive statistics for our full sample, as
well as for the subset of multinationals. Not surprisingly, multinationals are on average larger in
terms of employment, sales and number of integrated SIC codes, as compared to the typical firm
in our data. We will show nevertheless that our core findings concerning the relationship between
“upstreamness” and integration patterns are stable when we look at different subsamples.

3.2

Key Variables

Integrated and Outsourced Inputs
For each parent, WorldBase provides us with information on the inputs that are integrated within
the firm’s ownership boundaries. In order to further identify which inputs are outsourced, we combine the above with information from U.S. Input-Output (I-O) Tables, following the methodology
of Fan and Lang (2000). (See also Acemoglu et al., 2009, and Alfaro et al., 2016.)
To fix ideas, consider an economy with N > 1 industries. In what follows, we refer to output
industries by j and input industries by i. For each industry pair, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N , the I-O Tables
report the dollar value of i used directly as an input in the production of $1 of j, also known as
the direct requirements coefficient, drij . Denote with D the corresponding square matrix that has
drij as its (i, j)-th entry. In practice, each input i can be used not just directly, but could also
enter further upstream, i.e., more than one stage prior to the actual production of j. The total
dollar value of i used either directly or indirectly to produce $1 of j is called the total requirements
coefficient, trij , and this reflects the overall importance of the input for the production of j. As is
well known, trij is given by the (i, j)-th entry of [I − D]−1 D, where I is the identity matrix and
[I − D]−1 is the Leontief inverse matrix.
In our baseline analysis, we designate the primary SIC code reported in WorldBase for each
parent p as its output industry j. We first use the I-O Tables to deduce the set of 4-digit SIC inputs
S(j) – including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing inputs – that are used either directly
or indirectly in the production of j, namely: S(j) = {i : trij > 0}. We then identify which inputs
are integrated and which are outsourced as follows. Define I(p) ⊆ S(j) to be the set of integrated
inputs of parent p. The elements of I(p) are the primary and secondary SIC codes of p and all its
subsidiaries (if any) as reported in WorldBase, these being inputs that the parent can in principle
obtain within its ownership boundaries. We then define the complement set, N I(p) = S(j) \ I(p),

20

to be the set of non-integrated SICs for parent p, these being the inputs required in the production
of j that have not been identified as integrated in I(p). Note that with this construction, the
primary SIC activity j of the parent is automatically classified as an element of I(p), so we will
later explore the robustness of our results to dropping this “self-SIC” code. (We will also consider
several alternative treatments of what constitutes the output industry j for those parent firms that
feature multiple manufacturing SIC codes.)
To implement the above, we turn to the 1992 U.S. Benchmark I-O Tables from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA).17 The U.S. Tables are one of the few publicly-available I-O accounts that
provide a level of industry detail close to the 4-digit SIC codes used in WorldBase, while the 1992
vintage is the most recent year for which the BEA provides a concordance from its I-O industry
classification to the 1987 SIC system.18 Readers familiar with these tables will be aware that the
concordance is not a one-to-one key. This is not a major problem given our focus on parents whose
primary output j is in manufacturing, as the key assigns a unique 6-digit I-O industry to each
4-digit SIC code between 2000 and 3999. Outside these sectors, in those inputs i whose 6-digit I-O
industry code maps to multiple 4-digit SIC codes, we split the total requirements value trij equally
across the multiple SIC codes that i maps to.
Panel A of Table A-1 in the Online Appendix shows that the mean trij value associated with
the inputs integrated by firms in WorldBase is 0.019241 (or 0.006774 when the I-O diagonal entries
are dropped); this is larger than the average trij value across the 416,349 (i, j) pairs in the I-O
Tables that are relevant to our study (0.001311). In other words, firms tend to integrate stages
that are more important in terms of total requirements usage.19 We can further report that 98.0%
of the (i, j) pairs in our WorldBase sample, namely inputs i that are integrated by a parent firm
with output industry j, are relevant for production in the sense that trij > 0.20 As mentioned
before, firms tend to integrate very few of the inputs necessary to produce their final good. The
median number of integrated stages is 2, compared to a median number of non-integrated stages
equal to 906. There is considerable skewness, however, as the corresponding 90th, 95th, and 99th
percentiles of the number of integrated stages are 3, 4, and 6, while the maximum number is 254.21
As discussed below, however, integrated inputs tend to be “bunched” together along the value
chain, consistent with our model.
17

The BEA draws on records of movements across establishments when constructing the U.S. I-O Tables.
See Chapters 3 and 6 of the BEA’s “Concepts and Methods of the U.S. Input-Output Accounts”, available at
http://www.bea.gov/papers/pdf/IOmanual 092906.pdf.
18
This concordance is available from: http://www.bea.gov/industry/exe/ndn0017.exe.
19
In the 1992 U.S. I-O Tables, there are altogether 416,349 I-O pairs that are relevant to our study, namely that
involve a SIC manufacturing output j and a SIC input i (either in manufacturing or non-manufacturing), with
trij > 0. Of these, 57,057 or 13.7% can be found in our WorldBase firm sample of integrated input by parent primary
industry pairs. The share is very similar if the input-output pairs along the diagonal are excluded from consideration
(13.6% = 56, 612/415, 904).
20
85.6% of these pairs actually exceed the median trij value of 0.000163 (where this median is taken over the same
416,349 I-O pairs from the preceding footnote). We obtain similarly high relevance rates when restricting the count
to manufacturing inputs only, or if we drop the self-SIC of the parent firm (i.e., pairs where i = j).
21
The median number of integrated inputs is very similar when computed industry-by-industry, varying between
1 and 3. On the other hand, the maximum number of integrated inputs exhibits more variation across industries,
ranging from 3 to 254 (with a median value of 26).

21

Upstreamness
We make further use of the information on production linkages contained in I-O Tables, to obtain
a measure of the “upstreamness” of an input i in the production of output j. To capture this, we
build on the methodology in Fally (2012) and Antràs et al. (2012), and define the following:
U pstreamnessij =

drij + 2
drij +

PN

drik drkj
Pk=1
N
k=1 drik drkj

P
PN
+3 N
drik drkl drlj + . . .
k=1
.
PN PN l=1
+ k=1 l=1 drik drkl drlj + . . .

(15)

Observe that drij is the value of i that enters exactly one stage prior to the production of j, that
PN
k=1 drik drkj is the value of i that enters two stages prior to production of j, and so on and so
forth. The denominator in (15) is therefore equal to trij , written as an infinite sum over the value of
i’s use that enters exactly n stages removed from the production of j (where n = 1, 2, . . . , ∞). The
numerator is similarly an infinite sum, but there each input use term is multiplied by an integer
equal to the number of stages upstream at which the input value enters the production process.
Looking then at (15), Upstreamnessij is a weighted average of how many stages removed from j
the use of i is, where the weights correspond to the share of trij that enters at that corresponding
upstream stage. In particular, a larger Upstreamnessij means that a greater share of the total input
use value of i is accrued further upstream in the production process for j.
Note that Upstreamnessij ≥ 1 by construction, with equality if and only if trij = drij , namely
when the entirety of the input use of i goes directly into the production of j via one stage. With
some matrix algebra, one can see that the numerator of (15) is equal to the (i, j)-th entry of
[I − D]−2 D. Together with the formula for trij noted earlier (i.e., the (i, j)-th entry of [I − D]−1 D),
one can then calculate Upstreamnessij when provided with the direct requirements matrix, D.
Two further remarks are in order. First, we should stress the distinction between Upstreamnessij
and the measure put forward previously in Fally (2012) and Antràs et al. (2012). The measure
in this earlier work captured the average production line position of each industry i with respect
to final demand (i.e., consumption and investment), whereas our current Upstreamnessij instead
reflects the position of input i with respect to output industry j. This is therefore a measure
of production staging specific to each input-output industry pair, which we can directly map to
the firm-level observations in our dataset to assess the validity of the model’s predictions. Second,
Upstreamnessij also has the interpretation of an “average propagation length”, a concept introduced
in Dietzenbacher et al. (2005) to capture the average number of stages taken by a shock in i to
spread to industry j. Dietzenbacher et al. (2005) in fact show that this average propagation length
has the appealing property that it is invariant to whether one adopts a forward or backward linkage
perspective when computing the average number of stages between a pair of industries.
We use the direct requirements matrix derived from the 1992 U.S. I-O Tables to calculate
Upstreamnessij .22 We first obtain Upstreamnessij for each 6-digit I-O industry pair, before mapping
22

We apply an open-economy and net-inventories correction to the direct requirements matrix D, before calculating
trij and Upstreamnessij . This involves a simple adjustment to each drij to take into account input flows across borders,
as well as into and out of inventories, on the assumption that these flows occur in proportion to what is observed in
domestic input-output transactions; see Antràs et al. (2012) for details.

22

these to 4-digit SIC codes. As mentioned earlier, each 4-digit manufacturing SIC code is mapped
to a single 6-digit I-O code; this means that we can uniquely assign an Upstreamnessij value to
SIC code pairs where both the input i and output j are in manufacturing. The complications arise
only when we have a non-manufacturing input i which maps to multiple 6-digit I-O codes. We
adopt a range of approaches in such cases, by taking either: (i) the simple mean of Upstreamnessij
over constituent I-O codes of the SIC input industry; (ii) the median value; (iii) a random pick;
or (iv) the trij -weighted average value. Reassuringly, the pairwise correlation of the upstreamness
measures obtained under these different treatments is very high (> 0.98), and our regression results
will not depend on which specific approach we adopt, so we will focus on the version that uses a
simple mean as our baseline. To be clear, what this yields is a measure of the average number of
production stages based on the I-O classification system that are traversed between a given pair of
SIC industries.
Panel B of Table A-1 in the Online Appendix presents some basic information on the total
requirements and upstreamness variables after the mapping to SIC codes. Figure 6 provides an
illustration of the variation contained in the Upstreamnessij measure, even when focusing on one
particular input industry, in this case Tires and Inner Tubes (SIC 3011). Notice that Upstreamnessij
is indeed smaller for j sectors such as Mobile Homes (2451), Lawn and Garden Equipment (3524),
Industrial Trucks and Tractors (3537), Motorcycles, Bicycles, and Parts (3751), and Transportation
Equipment, n.e.c. (3799), these being industries that use tires almost exclusively as a direct input.
For comparison and to illustrate the difference, Figure 6 also depicts the upstreamness of Tires
with respect to final demand (from Antràs et al. 2012); this is the horizontal line with value 2.0954.

As noted before, firms tend to integrate few inputs. This is a key feature of the data that our
model can accommodate, as explained in the discussion on “sparse integration” in Section 2.2.C.
Our upstreamness measure allows us to examine the extent to which – though sparse – integrated
inputs nevertheless tend to be “bunched” together, consistent with the environment described in
this earlier extension on “sparse integration”. To do so, we focus on firms that report at least two
secondary manufacturing SIC codes (on top of their primary output industry j). Table A-3 in the
Online Appendix computes the probability that a pair of randomly drawn integrated manufacturing
SICs of a given firm would belong to any two quintiles of Upstreamnessij , where j is the output
industry of the firm and the quintiles are taken over all SIC manufacturing inputs i in the value
chain for producing j; the reported probability is an average across all firms under consideration.
From Table A-3, one can see that firms are clearly more likely to integrate inputs in the first
quintile of upstreamness than in the other quintiles. Leaving aside this first quintile, note that the
probability that a firm integrates an input is significantly higher when it already owns an input
in the same quintile, and furthermore these probabilities fall for quintiles that are further apart.
These patterns are suggestive of the existence of “bunching” along the value chain in the integration
decisions of firms.

Ratio-Upstreamness
To test whether the variation across parent firms in integration decisions is consistent with our
theory, we first explore specifications with a dependent variable that summarizes the extent to
which a firm’s integrated inputs tend to be more upstream compared to its non-integrated inputs.
For this purpose, we construct the following measure for each parent:
P

i∈I(p)

Ratio-U pstreamnessjp = P

i∈N I(p)

where θIijp = trij /

P

i∈I(p) trij

I
and θN
ijp = trij /

P

θIijp U psteamnessij
I
θN
ijp U pstreamnessij

i∈N I(p) trij .

,

(16)

This takes the ratio of a weighted-

average upstreamness of p’s integrated inputs relative to that of its non-integrated inputs; the
weights here are proportional to the total requirements coefficients to capture the relative importance of each input in the production of j. By design, Ratio-Upstreamnessjp is thus larger, the
greater is the propensity of p to integrate relatively upstream inputs, while outsourcing its more
downstream inputs.
We will consider several variants of Ratio-Upstreamnessjp to assess the robustness of our results
under different constructions. These include: (i) restricting S(j) to the set of “ever-integrated”
inputs, namely inputs i for which we actually observe at least one parent in industry j that integrates i within its boundaries; (ii) restricting S(j) to the set of manufacturing inputs; and (iii)
excluding the self-SIC from S(j). The first alternative measure of Ratio-Upstreamnessjp is of particular importance. The restriction to the set of “ever-integrated” inputs is a plausible criterion
for removing input-output industry pairs for which the fixed costs of integration are prohibitively

24

high. By constructing Ratio-Upstreamnessjp using only the subset of inputs for which integration
is seen in our dataset to be feasible, we are able to test more closely the predictions of the model
that arise in the empirically-relevant case where integrated inputs are sparse (i.e., Proposition 4).
Panel C of Table A-1 in the Online Appendix presents summary statistics for the different ratioupstreamness measures. Note that Ratio-Upstreamnessjp tends to take on values smaller than one
for the constructions that include the self-SIC of the parent in the set I(p). This is because the
upstreamness of j’s use of itself as an input (Upstreamnessjj ) tends to be relatively small in value,
and this acts to lower the numerator of Ratio-Upstreamnessjp . When we drop the self-SIC, this
results in a Ratio-Upstreamnessjp measure with a median value closer to 1. The pairwise correlation
between the different versions of Ratio-Upstreamnessjp is high (typically > 0.8), except when the
self-SIC is excluded, in which case the correlation with the baseline measure drops to about 0.15.
Our first set of regression specifications will use Ratio-Upstreamnessjp as the dependent variable,
and thus seek to exploit the variation across firms in this measure. Our theory has predictions at
the input level as well, so we will also present evidence based on variation within firms in integration
decisions across inputs. For this second set of specifications, we adopt as the dependent variable a
0-1 indicator for whether the input in question is integrated within the parent’s ownership structure,
i.e., whether i ∈ I(p). In both the cross- and within-firm exercises, we will present evidence based
on a broad set of inputs used in production by the firms, as well as when restricting to the subset
of ever-integrated inputs to account for the sparsity of integrated stages.
Our dataset does not allow us to directly observe whether plants that are related in an ownership
sense actually contribute inputs and components to a common production process. It is important
to stress that any potential misclassification of integrated versus non-integrated inputs (in the sets
I(p) and N I(p)) would give rise to measurement error in the dependent variable in our regressions.
To the extent that this is classical measurement error, it would make our coefficient estimates less
precise, making it harder to find empirical support for the model’s predictions.

Demand Elasticity
As highlighted in our theory, the incentives to integrate upstream or downstream suppliers are
crucially affected by whether the elasticity of demand faced by the firm (ρj ) is higher or lower than
the elasticity of technological substitution across its inputs (αj ). For practical reasons, we focus on
variation in the former in most of the regressions, since detailed estimates of demand elasticities
are available from standard sources. To capture ρj , we use the U.S. import demand elasticities
from Broda and Weinstein (2006). The original estimates are for HS10 products, and we average
these up to the SIC industry level using U.S. import trade values as weights (see Section A-2 of the
Online Appendix for further details). Since the HS10 codes are highly disaggregated, this should in
principle provide a good proxy for ρj in the model, short of having actual firm-level elasticities. We
will also pursue several refinements of ρj , by using only elasticities for those HS10 codes deemed as
consumption and capital goods in the United Nations’ Classification by Broad Economic Categories
(BEC). (The omitted category is goods classified as intermediates.) As the model arguably applies
25

better to final goods, a demand elasticity constructed based on such products should yield a cleaner
proxy for ρj . Note that when refining the construction in this manner, about half of the 459 SIC
manufacturing industries are dropped, namely those industries composed entirely of intermediate
goods.
The UN BEC classification also provides a basis for constructing a proxy for αj . From the
model, αj is closely related to the elasticity of demand for each intermediate input by firms in
industry j. We therefore begin by computing the average demand elasticity for each 4-digit SIC
code using now only those HS10 elasticities that correspond to products classified as intermediates,
in an analogous fashion to the construction of the ρj refinements above. We construct our proxy
for αj as the weighted average of the intermediate-good demand elasticities across inputs i used in
j’s production, with weights proportional to the total requirements coefficients, trij .
In principle, the value of ρj − αj could then be used to distinguish whether a given industry j
falls in the complements or substitutes case. Nevertheless, since our proxies of ρj and especially αj
are imperfect, in our baseline regressions we will associate the sequential complements case with
high values of ρj and the substitutes case with low values of ρj . This approach is valid insofar
as the demand elasticity and input substitutability parameters are relatively uncorrelated across
industries.23 For corroboration, we will also report specifications in which the complements and
substitutes cases are related to the size of the difference ρj − αj .

Input Contractibility
The model further predicts that patterns of integration will depend on the extent to which contractible inputs tend to be “front-loaded” or located in the early stages of the production process.
We therefore construct the variable Upstream-Contractibilityj , which reflects the tendency for highcontractibility inputs to enter the production of output j at relatively upstream stages, for use in
the cross-firm regressions.
We start by following Nunn (2007) in constructing a measure of input contractibility for each
SIC industry. The basis for this measure is the Rauch (1999) classification of products into whether
they are: (i) homogeneous; (ii) reference-priced; or (iii) differentiated in nature. The “contractintensity” of an industry is then the share of the constituent HS product codes in the composition of
the industry’s input use that is classified as differentiated (i.e., neither homogeneous nor referencepriced), on the premise that it is inherently more difficult to specify and enforce the terms of
contractual agreements for such products. As our interest is in the converse concept of contractibility, we use instead one minus the Nunn measure of contract-intensity.24 Denote this metric of input
contractibility for industry i by conti . Then, for each output industry j, we calculate Upstream23
Indeed, the pairwise correlation between the constructed proxy for αj and the measures of ρj (both the baseline
measure and its refinements) is low, ranging between −0.026 and 0.083. As reported in Table A-2 in the Online
Appendix, our proxies for αj are on average higher than those for ρj .
24
In Nunn’s (2007) notation, the measure of input contractibility that we use is equal to 1 − z rs1 . The results
reported are based on the “conservative” Rauch (1999) classification, but are robust when using the alternative
“liberal” classification instead.

ij conti are total requirements weighted averages of the upstreamness and contractibility variables respectively. Therefore, if high-contractibility inputs tend to be located at
earlier production stages, this will lead to a larger (more positive) covariance and hence a higher
Upstream-Contractibilityj ; we refer to such an industry as exhibiting a greater degree of “upstream
contractibility”.25
In the within-firm regressions, we can perform a more detailed test of the role of contractibility
in explaining the propensity to integrate particular inputs. Motivated by the theory, we construct
the variable Contractibility-up-to-iij , which is an input-output industry pair-specific measure of the
contractibility up to input i in the production of j. This is computed as:
P
Contractibility-up-to-iij = P

where the relevant set of inputs, Sim (j), for the sum in the numerator is those manufacturing
inputs that are located upstream of and including i itself in the production of j, i.e., Sim (j) =
{k ∈ S m (j) : U pstreamnesskj ≥ U pstreamnessij }. The denominator thus sums up the product
of the total requirements and contractibility values across all manufacturing inputs used in the
production of j, with the numerator being the partial sum excluding all inputs downstream of

in the expression for the optimal β ∗ , and hence the propensity towards integration of each input in
the production of j.

Empirical Methodology and Results

Having described our data sources and variable construction, we next translate the key results of our
model into a series of empirical predictions that can be taken to the data. According to Proposition
1, integration patterns along the value chain should vary systematically for industries that fall under
25
We have also experimented with alternative measures of Upstream-Contractibilityj , by taking a ratio of the
trij -weighted upstreamness of inputs classified as being of high contractibility relative to those classified as low
contractibility, in a manner analogous to the construction of the ratio-upstreamness measure in (16). To distinguish
high- versus low-contractibility inputs, we have adopted either the first tercile, median, or second tercile values of

the sequential complements versus substitutes cases. Our approach to distinguish between these
two cases focuses on variation in ρj (or alternatively, ρj − αj ). However, the limitations inherent
in how ρj and αj are constructed mean that we cannot use them to precisely delineate where
the cutoff between the complements and substitutes cases lies. Consequently, what we test in our
regressions is a weaker version of Proposition 1, that examines whether the propensity to integrate
upstream stages falls as ρj (alternatively, ρj − αj ) increases, and we more confidently move towards
the complements case. We thus formulate the first cross-firm prediction of our model as follows:
P.1 (Cross): A firm’s propensity to integrate upstream (as opposed to downstream) inputs should
fall with ρj (alternatively, ρj − αj ), where j is the final-good industry of the firm.
Our data also allows us to explore integration decisions made across different inputs at the firm
level, through specifications in which the unit of observation is a parent firm by input SIC pair. In
this within-firm setting, we can restate the first prediction as follows:
P.1 (Within): The upstreamness of an input should have a more negative effect on the propensity
of a firm to integrate that input, the larger is ρj (alternatively, ρj − αj ).
The first extension of the model developed in Section 2.2.A provides us with further predictions
that emerge from considering heterogeneity in the contractibility of inputs. In particular, Proposition 2 suggests that the relative propensity to integrate upstream inputs depends on the extent
to which contractible inputs tend to be located in the early stages of production. Moreover, the
effect of “upstream contractibility” varies subtly across the sequential complements and substitutes
cases. The second cross-firm prediction of our model can be summarized as:
P.2 (Cross): A greater degree of contractibility of upstream inputs should decrease a firm’s propensity to integrate upstream (as opposed to downstream) inputs when the firm is in a final-good
industry with low ρj (alternatively, ρj − αj ). Conversely, it should increase that propensity
when the firm is in a final-good industry with a high ρj (alternatively, ρj − αj ).
The corresponding prediction at the firm-input pair level can be stated as:
P.2 (Within): The degree of contractibility of inputs upstream of a given input (relative to the
inputs downstream of it) should have a more positive effect on the propensity of a firm to
integrate that input, the larger is ρj (alternatively, ρj − αj ).
From the second extension of the model developed in Section 2.2.B, we can derive predictions
concerning the role of the productivity of final good producers. The results in Proposition 3 can
be stated in testable form as follows:
P.3: More productive firms should integrate more inputs, irrespective of ρj (or ρj −αj ). Relative to
less productive firms, they should have a higher propensity to integrate downstream (relative
to upstream inputs) when ρj (alternatively, ρj −αj ) is low, and a higher propensity to integrate
upstream (relative to downstream inputs) when ρj (alternatively, ρj − αj ) is high.

4.1

Cross-firm Results

We first exploit variation in integration choices across firms to assess the validity of our model’s
predictions. To examine prediction P.1 (Cross), we estimate the following regression:
log Ratio-Upstreamnessjpc = β 0 + β 1 1(ρj > ρmed ) + β X Xj + β W Wp + Dc + jpc .

(19)

The dependent variable is the log ratio-upstreamness measure, defined in equation (16), which captures the propensity of each parent p with primary SIC industry j to integrate relatively upstream
inputs. Note that the subscript c is introduced to index the country where the parent is located,
as we will include a full set of country fixed effects, Dc , among the controls. We report standard
errors clustered at the level of the SIC output industry j.
The key regressor of interest is the dummy variable 1(ρj > ρmed ), which identifies whether the
elasticity of demand ρj is above the median value of ρ across industries. This variable is meant
to pick out industries that fall under the sequential complements case. Prediction P.1 (Cross)
suggests that β 1 should be negative: As we transition to industries that fall under the complements
case, the propensity to integrate upstream relative to downstream inputs should fall. For all the
specifications that we describe below, we will also run regressions in which the demand elasticity
ρj is instead replaced by our proxy for ρj − αj ; in (19), this means that we will test P.1 (Cross)
using an indicator variable for whether ρj − αj exceeds its median value across industries j.
We include a list of auxiliary industry and firm controls in the above specification. The vector
Xj includes measures of factor intensity, R&D intensity, and a value-added to shipments ratio (see
Section A-2 of the Online Appendix for a more detailed description, as well as Table A-2 in that
same Appendix for basic summary statistics). The vector Wp contains parent firm characteristics
obtained from WorldBase. This includes several variables that reflect the size of the parent, namely
the number of establishments, whether it is a multinational, as well as log total employment and log
total sales.26 We also account for the age of the parent by including the year of its establishment
(or in which current ownership took control).
Table 1 reports the results of estimating (19). Column (1) presents a stripped-down specification in which only 1(ρj > ρmed ) and parent country fixed effects are included. The estimated
coefficient on our proxy for the complements case is negative and significant at the 10% level, already confirming that the propensity to integrate upstream stages is lower in industries that face
a high demand elasticity, consistent with prediction P.1 (Cross). This result becomes even more
significant (at the 1% level) as we successively add the output industry variables Xj in column
(2), and the parent controls Wp in column (3). Looking at these auxiliary variables, the estimates
indicate that there is a tendency towards upstream integration in more equipment capital-intensive
industries, as well as in firms with more establishments, younger firms, and in multinationals.

26

For employment and sales, we also include dummy variables for whether the respective variables were based on
actual data or were otherwise estimated/approximated by WorldBase.

Notes: The sample comprises all firms with primary SIC in manufacturing and at least 20 employees in the 2004/2005 vintage of
D&B WorldBase. The dependent variable is the log ratio-upstreamness measure described in Section 3. A median cutoff dummy
is used to distinguish firms with primary SIC output that are in high vs low demand elasticity industries. Columns (1)-(3) use
a measure based on all available HS10 elasticities from Broda and Weinstein (2006); column (4) restricts this construction to HS
codes classified as consumption or capital goods in the UN BEC; column (5) further restricts this to consumption goods; column (6)
uses the consumption-goods-only demand elasticity minus a proxy for α to distinguish between the complements and substitutes
cases. All columns include parent country fixed effects. Columns (3)-(6) also include indicator variables for whether the reported
employment and sales data respectively are estimated/missing/from the low end of a range, as opposed to being from actual data
(coefficients not reported). Standard errors are clustered by parent primary SIC industry; ***, **, and * denote significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively.

The remaining columns in Table 1 explore alternative elasticity measures to capture industries
in the complements case. Column (4) restricts the construction of ρj to the use of product-level elasticities classified by the UN BEC as either consumption or capital goods (dropping the intermediateuse products), while column (5) further limits this to just consumption goods elasticities. These
refinements would in principle yield elasticities that pertain more directly to final-goods demand.
Reassuringly, this does not change the key finding of a negative and highly significant coefficient
on the high-elasticity dummy, even though the number of observations falls as SIC industries that

30

are composed entirely of intermediate-use goods are dropped from the sample. Finally, column (6)
brings in information related to the demand elasticity for intermediate inputs, through the proxy
for αj . The key right-hand side variable is now an indicator for whether ρj − αj is larger or smaller
than its median value, where ρj is the demand elasticity from column (5) based on consumption
goods only and the construction of αj was described earlier (in Section 3). We continue to find
that the propensity to integrate upstream stages is lower for industries that more likely correspond
to the complements case on the basis of ρj − αj .
Figures 7 and 8 provide an illustration of these patterns of integration along the value chain,
using examples from our sample of firms. The complements case is illustrated by a Danish firm
whose primary activity is Boat Building and Repairing (SIC 3732), this being an output industry
that exhibits an above-median ρj and ρj −αj value regardless of the variant of the demand elasticity
proxy considered. The firm has integrated one SIC activity other than its primary SIC (reflecting
the sparsity of integration), namely Internal Combustion Engines (SIC 3519), which is one of the
most downstream among the top 100 manufacturing inputs by total requirements value used by
SIC 3732 (see Figure 7). Conversely, the substitutes case is exemplified by a Swedish producer of
Household Furniture (SIC 2519), this being an industry that consistently exhibits below-median
ρj and ρj − αj values. The firm has integrated one SIC activity other than its primary SIC,
namely Fabricated Metal Products (SIC 3499), which is among the most upstream of its top 100
manufacturing inputs (see Figure 8).

Notes: The figure plots the Upstreamnessij measure for the top-100 manufacturing inputs of SIC 2519 (Household Furniture).
This sector exhibits a below-median ρj and ρj − αj value regardless of the variant of the demand elasticity proxy considered.
The labels on the horizontal axes reflect the SIC codes of these top-100 inputs for SIC 2519. The example is based on a firm
in our sample that has only one integrated manufacturing input other than the self-SIC; the upstreamness of this input (SIC
3499) is illustrated by the bold horizontal line.

We also test prediction P.1 (Cross) by using specifications based upon a finer cut by quintiles
of our proxy for ρj (alternatively, ρj − αj ):
log Ratio-Upstreamnessjpc = β 0 +

5
X

β n 1(ρj ∈ Quintn (ρ)) + β X Xj + β W Wp + Dc + jpc .

(20)

n=2

Here, 1(ρj ∈ Quintn (ρ)) is an indicator variable for whether the demand elasticity for industry
j belongs in the n-th quintile of that variable; the first quintile dummy is the omitted category.
This approach has the advantage of allowing for more flexibility in the relationship between our
empirical proxy for ρj and our ratio-upstreamness dependent variable.
Table 2 repeats the exercise in Table 1 using the above quintile specification. In line with
our model’s predictions, the magnitude of the estimated negative coefficient increases steadily as
we move from the second to the fifth elasticity quintile throughout columns (2)-(6). As in Table
1, the regression based on the most stringent refinement of the ρj proxy – that in column (5)
using consumption goods elasticities alone – yields the largest point estimates for the coefficients of
interest. The implied magnitudes of these effects is fairly sizeable: looking at columns (5) and (6),
the fifth-quintile point estimates of −0.1849 and −0.1026 correspond to a range of between a half
to a full standard deviation decrease (relative to the first quintile) in the propensity to integrate
upstream inputs.

Notes: The sample comprises all firms with primary SIC in manufacturing and at least 20 employees in the 2004/2005 vintage
of D&B WorldBase. The dependent variable is the log ratio-upstreamness measure described in Section 3. Quintile dummies are
used to distinguish firms with primary SIC output that are in high vs low demand elasticity industries. Columns (1)-(3) use a
measure based on all available HS10 elasticities from Broda and Weinstein (2006); column (4) restricts this construction to HS
codes classified as consumption or capital goods in the UN BEC; column (5) further restricts this to consumption goods; column (6)
uses the consumption-goods-only demand elasticity minus a proxy for α to distinguish between the complements and substitutes
cases. All columns include parent country fixed effects. Columns (3)-(6) also include indicator variables for whether the reported
employment and sales data respectively are estimated/missing/from the low end of a range, as opposed to being from actual data
(coefficients not reported). Standard errors are clustered by parent primary SIC industry; ***, **, and * denote significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively.

We turn next to assess the validity of prediction P.2 (Cross). For this, we augment the specifi-

33

cations in (19) and (20) in order to uncover the effects of upstream contractibility on integration:
log Ratio-Upstreamnessjpc = β 0 + β 1 1(ρj > ρmed ) + β U 1 1(ρj < ρmed ) × U pstream-Contractibilityj
+β U 2 1(ρj > ρmed ) × U pstream-Contractibilityj

(22)

In the median cutoff specification in (21), we interact the dummy variables 1(ρj < ρmed ) and 1(ρj >
ρmed ) with Upstream-Contractibilityj ; based on prediction P.2 (Cross), we would expect β U 1 < 0
and β U 2 > 0 in this regression. Likewise in (22), we interact each of the quintile dummies with
Upstream-Contractibilityj , where the theory would lead us to expect that β U 1 < 0 and β U 5 > 0.27
The results of (21) are reported in Table 3. Notice that the estimated coefficient on the proxy
for the complements case, 1(ρj > ρmed ), is negative and significant, as in the previous regressions
in Table 1.28 Turning to the interactions with Upstream-Contractibilityj , the estimated coefficient
in the complements case is positive and statistically significant, while that in the substitutes case
is negative and also highly significant. This is entirely in line with the predictions of the model:
firms that fall under the complements case should have a lower propensity to integrate upstream
stages, but this tendency is weakened among those industries whose production processes inherently
exhibit a greater degree of upstream contractibility. The converse holds for the substitutes case,
with Upstream-Contractibilityj instead lowering the propensity to integrate upstream stages when
ρj < ρmed . Note that these results hold when restricting the elasticity measure to HS codes classified
as consumption or capital goods in column (2), when further limiting this to consumption goods
elasticities only in column (3), and when using the proxy for ρj − αj to distinguish between the
two cases in column (4).
Table 4 validates the predictions related to upstream contractibility in the more flexible quintile
elasticity specification in (22). The main effects of the quintile elasticity dummies exhibit a pattern
similar to that in the more parsimonious regressions in Table 2, with negative and significant
coefficients especially as we transition to the higher quintiles. We perform a test for whether
the effect of being in the fifth quintile, evaluated at the median in-sample value of UpstreamContractibilityj in that fifth demand elasticity quintile, is in fact significantly different from zero.
27

The correlation between Upstream-Contractibilityj and the ρj proxy is small and never exceeds 0.06 in absolute
value when we look across the various versions of the demand elasticity measure that we have constructed. The
interaction terms are thus unlikely to be picking up a non-linear effect of the demand elasticity.
28
We have verified that the overall effect of the 1(ρj > ρmed ) variable – taking into account its main effect and
that through the interaction term with upstream contractibility – is indeed negative when evaluated at the median
in-sample value of Upstream-Contractibilityj for industries that exhibit an above-median ρj . The p-value for this
coefficient test on the overall effect of 1(ρj > ρmed ) in the complements case is reported for each column in Table 3.

34

The p-values reported in each column confirm that this is indeed the case, so that the propensity
to integrate upstream inputs is lower in the fifth relative to the first elasticity quintile; this holds
true regardless of the variant of the elasticity proxy used across the columns. Of note, we find that
in the complements case, a higher degree of upstream contractibility does counteract the above
tendency to outsource upstream inputs, as the estimated coefficient on the fifth elasticity quintile
interacted with Upstream-Contractibilityj is positive and statistically significant (at the 1% level)
across all columns. Conversely, the interaction term between the first elasticity quintile dummy and
Upstream-Contractibilityj bears the opposite sign, indicating that upstream contractibility instead
acts to raise the propensity to integrate downstream inputs in this latter case. This last pattern
appears most strongly in columns (1)-(3), where a demand elasticity associated with the output
industry ρj is used to separate the complements from the substitutes cases. In column (4), where
ρj −αj is used instead, the largest negative effect appears to be concentrated in the second elasticity
quintile. The overall message we obtain is nevertheless in line with prediction P.2 (Cross), which
relates integration decisions to the sequencing of high- versus low-contractibility inputs.

Notes: The sample comprises all firms with primary SIC in manufacturing and at least 20 employees in the 2004/2005

10% levels respectively.

As discussed earlier, a key feature of the data is that the integration of inputs is relatively
sparse. We have shown in Proposition 4 that this does not affect the qualitative predictions of our
model, if we limit attention to the subset of inputs over which integration is feasible. This suggests
that a sharper test of our theory would seek to drop from the analysis inputs for which integration
is prohibitively costly. In Table 5, we implement one such test by basing the ratio-upstreamness
measure on the set of “ever-integrated” inputs only. Recall that this restricts the set S(j) in the
construction of Ratio-Upstreamnessjpc to inputs i for which we actually observe that i is integrated
by at least one parent firm in our dataset with (either primary or secondary) industry j. This
36

criterion substantially pares down the set of input-output pairs under consideration, as only 93,910
(or 22.6%) of the 416,349 (i, j) pairs in the U.S. I-O Tables that were previously used (i.e., with
trij > 0) are classified as ever-integrated. Moreover, the share of the total requirements value in
the production of output j that is accounted for by ever-integrated inputs stands at 46.5% (when
taking a simple mean across the 459 SIC manufacturing industries).

Notes: The sample comprises all firms with primary SIC in manufacturing and at least 20 employees in the 2004/2005 vintage
of D&B WorldBase. The dependent variable is the log ratio-upstreamness measure described in Section 3, constructed based
on the set of ever-integrated inputs. Upstream-Contractibilityj is the total requirements weighted covariance between the
contractibility and upstreamness of the manufacturing inputs used to produce good j. Quintile dummies are used to distinguish
firms with primary SIC output that are in high vs low demand elasticity industries. Column (1) uses a measure based on all
available HS10 elasticities from Broda and Weinstein (2006); column (2) restricts this construction to HS codes classified as
consumption or capital goods in the UN BEC; column (3) further restricts this to consumption goods; column (4) uses the
consumption-goods-only demand elasticity minus a proxy for α to distinguish between the complements and substitutes cases.
All columns include the full list of SIC output industry controls, firm-level variables, and parent country dummies that were
used in the earlier specifications in Table 2, columns (3)-(6). Standard errors are clustered by parent primary SIC industry;
***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively.

Table 5 reports the results from re-running the quintile elasticity specifications from Table 4,
when replacing the dependent variable with the refinement based on the set of ever-integrated

37

inputs (i.e., for which integration is observed to be feasible in our sample of firms). Once again,
the patterns line up with our model’s predictions: Regardless of the elasticity proxy used, the
propensity to integrate upstream stages is lower for firms in higher elasticity quintiles. However,
this tendency is counteracted if the industry in question features an input profile that has relatively
contractible upstream inputs.
We have subjected the cross-firm regressions to an extensive series of additional robustness
checks, which are reported in Tables A-5 to A-9 in the Online Appendix. There, we present results
based on our preferred specification in column (3) of Tables 4 and 5, which uses the ρj measure
constructed from consumption goods elasticities only; the results with the alternative elasticity
proxies are qualitatively similar and available upon request. Below, we briefly discuss the nature
of these sensitivity results, while leaving the details to Section A-3 in the Online Appendix.
In Table A-5, we show that the patterns are robust when examining different subsamples of
firms. More specifically, we obtain similar results when restricting the sample respectively to singleestablishment firms, domestic firms, or multinationals (i.e., firms with establishments in more than
one country).29 In Table A-6, we experiment with controlling for additional firm and industry
variables that relate to alternative motives for the vertical integration decisions of firms (see Section
A-3 in the Online Appendix for more details). These controls have an immaterial impact on our
estimates, even when these variables are jointly entered into the regression. Turning to Table A-7,
we demonstrate that our results are robust to alternative treatments of the identity of the primary
output industry for multi-product firms. In particular, our results hold when we re-designate the
output industry of each firm to be the SIC manufacturing code that is most downstream with respect
to final demand, on the basis of the Antràs et al. (2012) measure. We also show that the patterns
are similar when limiting the sample to firms whose primary SIC code is its only manufacturing
SIC activity. In Tables A-8 and A-9, we report several checks based on alternative constructions of
the ratio-upstreamness dependent variable. These include restricting the set S(j) to manufacturing
inputs, or to more relevant inputs with larger trij values. Our findings are broadly robust, with
the main exception being the results pertaining to the interaction with Upstream-Contractibilityj
when only manufacturing inputs excluding the parent SIC are considered; there, the coefficients do
not turn positive even for the highest quintile interactions.
We next move to test prediction P.3 of our model concerning the role of heterogeneity in firm
productivity. For this purpose, we are limited to using a simple measure of log sales per worker,
computed using total sales and employment across all establishments of the parent, to proxy for the
firm-level parameter θ in the model, as WorldBase contains little information on the operations of
firms beyond this.30 Moreover, when available, these variables are often based on estimates rather
29

The check related to single-establishment firms is reassuring in light of the findings in Atalay et al. (2014),
documenting small volumes of domestic shipments across plants owned by the same U.S. parent, and Ramondo et
al. (2016), indicating that the bulk of intrafirm trade involving a U.S. multinational parent tends to be concentrated
among a small number of its large foreign affiliates. In the case of single-establishment firms, it is unlikely that a
parent would not use the inputs produced in its own establishment.
30
Because log sales per worker is a measure of revenue-based productivity, it captures variation in both θ and A.
Proposition 3 shows, however, that our comparative statics results hold regardless of whether one varies θ or A.

38

than administrative data. To reduce the possible influence of such measurement error, we use a
dummy variable, 1(θp > θj,med ), which identifies highly productive firms as those with log sales per
worker above the median value within each output industry j.
According to the first part of prediction P.3, more productive firms should integrate more inputs,
in both the complements and substitutes cases. To verify this, we estimate the following:
log (No. of Integrated Inputs)jpc = β 0 +

5
X

β n 1(θp > θj,med ) × 1(ρj ∈ Quintn (ρ))

n=2

+β W Wp + Djc + jpc .

(23)

Note that the appropriate source of variation that we focus on here is that across firms within a
given industry, so the above regression is estimated with country-industry fixed effects, Djc . We
accordingly can include the same set of firm-level variables, Wp , used in the previous specifications
in Tables 1-5, but not the vector of industry controls, Xj .
The results from running (23) are reported in the first two columns of Table 6. We use a
measure of ρj constructed using consumption-goods only demand elasticities in column (1), before
using the alternative proxy for ρj − αj in column (2). The estimated coefficients of the 1(θp >
θj,med ) × 1(ρj ∈ Quintn (ρ)) interaction terms are almost all positive and significant, confirming
that more productive firms tend to integrate more SIC activities; this is regardless of whether the
industry in question falls closer to being in the substitutes or complements case.
According to the second part of prediction P.3, more productive firms should exhibit a higher
ratio-upstreamness in the complements case. The underlying intuition is that more productive
firms would be able to bear the higher fixed costs of integrating a larger set of stages within firm
boundaries, and so would engage in integrating some upstream inputs when compared against
smaller, less productive firms in the same industry. Conversely, the opposite would hold in the
substitutes case, with more productive firms instead featuring a lower ratio-upstreamness. To test
for such a pattern in the data, we therefore replace the dependent variable in (23) with log RatioUpstreamnessjpc and re-estimate the regression. The results are reported in columns (3)-(4) of
Table 6, these being based respectively on the ρj and ρj − αj proxies used in the first two columns
of the same table. The patterns that emerge are entirely in line with prediction P.3: the estimated
coefficient of the interaction term between 1(θp > θj,med ) and the first quintile of ρj is negative and
significant, while the corresponding coefficient for the fifth quintile of ρj is positive and significant.
We obtain a very similar set of estimates in columns (5)-(6), where we use the version of the ratioupstreamness measure that is based on ever-integrated inputs. Thus, more productive firms have
a lower (respectively, higher) relative propensity to integrate upstream inputs when the elasticity
of demand for their final product is low (respectively, high).31
31
The alert reader may wonder why we do not explore triple interactions between the demand elasticity quintiles,
the high-productivity dummy, and the upstream contractibility variable. However, as discussed in the proof of
Proposition 3 in Section A-1 of the Online Appendix, it is in general not possible to sign this effect in the theory.

Notes: The sample comprises all firms with primary SIC in manufacturing and at least 20 employees in the 2004/2005 vintage of D&B
WorldBase. The dependent variable in columns (1)-(2) is the log number of 4-digit SIC codes integrated by the firm, while that in columns
(3)-(6) is the log ratio-upstreamness measure described in Section 3. In columns (3)-(4), the dependent variable is constructed based on
all inputs, while in columns (5)-(6) it is constructed based on the set of ever-integrated inputs. Quintile dummies are used to distinguish
firms with primary SIC output that are in high vs low demand elasticity industries; columns (1), (3) and (5) use the elasticity measure
based only on HS10 codes classified as consumption goods in the UN BEC, while columns (2), (4) and (6) use the consumption-goods-only
demand elasticity minus the proxy for α to distinguish between the complements and substitutes cases. All columns include parent country
by parent primary SIC industry pair dummies, as well as the full list of firm-level variables used in the earlier specifications of Table 2,
columns (3)-(6). Standard errors are clustered by parent primary SIC industry; ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and
10% levels respectively.

Summing up, the cross-firm regressions provide strong evidence that the propensity for a firm to
integrate relatively upstream inputs is weakest when the demand elasticity faced by that industry
is largest, in line with prediction P.1 (Cross). Predictions P.2 (Cross) and P.3 concerning the role
of the contractibility of inputs along the value chain and the productivity of final good producers
also find strong support in the data.

Within-firm Results

We next exploit our data in more detail, by examining whether the patterns of integration within
firms are consistent with our model’s predictions. To study within-firm integration decisions, we
restructure the data so that an observation is now an input i by parent p pair.

To assess the validity of prediction P.1 (Within), we run the following specification:

The dependent variable is a 0-1 indicator for whether the firm p with primary output j has integrated the input i within firm boundaries. The key explanatory variables are the terms involving
Upstreamnessij and its interactions with the different quintiles of the elasticity variable. We include
a full set of parent fixed effects, Dp , thus focusing on within-firm variation in Integrationijp ; these
fixed effects also absorb any systematic differences arising from the identity of the output industry
or country of incorporation of the parent firm. When examining within-firm integration patterns
in this manner, our theory would suggest that γ 1 > 0 and γ 5 < 0.
We estimate (24) as a linear probability model, with standard errors clustered by i-j pair.
To avoid including firms for whom occurrences of integration are exceedingly rare, we restrict
the sample to parent firms that have integrated at least one manufacturing input other than the
parent’s output industry code. To keep the regressions tractable, we limit the sample to the top
100 manufacturing inputs i used by each industry j as ranked by the total requirements coefficient,
trij .32 Among the top-100 inputs, we further retain only those inputs i that are ever-integrated
by a parent firm in output j (as defined previously in Table 5). This is done bearing in mind the
extension on sparse integration from Section 2.2.C: Including in the regression inputs for which
integration is not feasible could obscure our ability to test Proposition 4 cleanly, particularly in
this within-firm, cross-input specification.33
The regression in (24) includes a vector Xij , to capture other industry pair characteristics that
might be correlated with the propensity of a parent firm in industry j to integrate input i. It
includes three sets of variables. First, we control for the dummy variable Self-SICij , which is equal
to 1 if and only if i = j. The dependent variable in (24) always takes on a value of 1 when i = j, as
j ∈ I(j) by definition. Including this dummy thus allows us to focus on the effects of Upstreamnessij
for manufacturing inputs other than j.34 Second, we control for the overall importance of input i
in the production of j, as reflected in the log of the total requirements coefficient, trij .
Third, we include a series of variables to capture the proximity between two industries i
and j, which have been explored elsewhere in the empirical literature on the determinants of
firm ownership.35 Using the 1992 U.S. I-O Tables, we have constructed a measure of UpstreamComplementarityij for each pair of industries, as the correlation between the direct requirements
coefficients of inputs k 6= i, j used in the production of i and j respectively. Similarly, we have constructed Downstream-Complementarityij as the correlation in the direct use of i and j (expressed
32

The top 100 manufacturing inputs cover between 88-98% of the total requirements value of each output industry.
We report broadly similar results in Tables A-13 and A-14 in the Online Appendix when using all top-100 inputs.
34
The findings are very similar if we drop the self-SIC inputs entirely from the sample (see Tables A-13 and A-14
in the Online Appendix).

We are grateful to an anonymous referee for suggesting the inclusion of such variables.

as a share of gross output in i and j respectively) across buying industries k 6= i, j. As argued by
Fan and Lang (2000), these measures capture the extent to which two industries enjoy economies
of scale in jointly procuring inputs, or in sharing marketing and distribution costs.36 We have
also constructed several measures of the relatedness of industries based on their factor intensities,
as the absolute difference between industries i and j in their skill, equipment capital, plant capital, and R&D intensities respectively. As pointed out by Atalay et al. (2014), empirical studies
testing the resource-based view of the firm show that when firms expand, they enter industries
for which the resource (e.g., capital, skill, or R&D) requirements match the requirements of the
industries in which the firm had already been producing (see Montgomery and Hariharan, 1991;
Neffke and Henning, 2013). Last but not least, the dummy variables Same-SIC2ij and Same-SIC3ij
respectively identify industries that share the first two and the first three digits in their SIC codes.
Similar indicators have been widely used in the literature to capture the proximity between two
industries (e.g., Alfaro and Charlton, 2009). (Summary statistics for these industry-pair variables
are reported in Table A-4 in the Online Appendix.)
Rounding off the description of (24), in our most stringent specifications, we will introduce a
full set of input dummies, Di , to control for characteristics of each input that might affect a firm’s
propensity to integrate it. When these input fixed effects are used, only covariates that vary at the
input-output (i-j) pair level can be identified in the estimation.
The results of the estimation of (24) are presented in Table 7. Column (1) reports a parsimonious
specification, in which we only include the interactions between Upstreamnessij and the demand
elasticity dummies (constructed from consumption-goods elasticities only), the Self-SICij dummy,
and log trij . The negative coefficients obtained on Upstreamnessij point to a lower propensity to
integrate upstream inputs across all output industries in general. However, in line with the weaker
statement in prediction P.1 (Within), firms are significantly less likely to integrate upstream inputs
in the complements case compared to the substitutes case: the γ 1 coefficient for the first elasticity
quintile interaction is significantly larger than the γ 5 coefficient for the fifth-quintile interaction.
(The test for the equality of these coefficients is rejected, as shown by the p-values near the bottom
of the table.)
In the columns that follow, we successively include the different measures of proximity between
industries i and j. In particular, controlling for Upstream-Complementarityij and DownstreamComplementarityij in column (2), we now find that firms in the lowest demand elasticity quintile
are more likely to integrate upstream inputs (γ 1 > 0 and significant at the 10% level), while
those in the highest elasticity quintile are more likely to integrate downstream inputs (γ 5 < 0
and significant at the 1% level). Thus, including proxies of the scope for cost savings in input
procurement and in marketing and distribution leads us to find support for the stronger version
of our model’s predictions.37 This pattern persists when we add the measures of factor intensity
36
While Fan and Lang (2000) take the average of these two complementarity measures in their study, we use each
of them as separate variables in our regressions.
37
The correlation between Upstreamnessij and Upstream-Complementarityij is −0.413, while that with
Downstream-Complementarityij is −0.406; these are computed over the restricted subset of ever-integrated top-

Notes: The dependent variable is a 0-1 indicator for whether the SIC input is integrated. Each observation is a SIC input by parent
firm pair, where the set of parent firms comprise those with primary SIC industry in manufacturing and employment of at least 20,
which have integrated at least one manufacturing input apart from the output self-SIC. The sample is restricted to the set of the top
100 ever-integrated manufacturing inputs, as ranked by the total requirements coefficients of the SIC output industry. The quintile
dummies in columns (1)-(5) are based on the elasticity measure constructed using only those HS10 elasticities from Broda and Weinstein
(2006) classified as consumption goods in the UN BEC; column (6) uses the consumption-goods-only demand elasticity minus a proxy
for α to distinguish between the complements and substitutes cases. All columns include parent firm fixed effects, while columns (5)
and (6) also include SIC input industry fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by input-output industry pair; ***, **, and * denote
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively.

differences (column (3)), the dummies for sharing the same first two or first three SIC digits (column
(4)), as well as input fixed effects (column (5)). When instead we use the ρj −αj proxy to distinguish
between the complements and substitutes cases (column (6)), we lose the positive sign on the γ 1
coefficient, but the propensity to integrate upstream continues to be significantly weaker in the
fifth relative to the first elasticity quintile.38
It is worth noting that the estimated coefficients for the variables capturing the proximity
between two industries are broadly consistent with theories that emphasize the importance of
intangibles in firm boundary choices (Atalay et al., 2014). In particular, one interpretation of the
positive and significant effects of the upstream- and downstream-complementarity measures is that
firms are more likely to engage in integration when it is easier to share intangible knowledge related
to common input procurement or marketing and distribution practices. Likewise, the regressions
indicate that firms are more likely to integrate inputs with similar skill-intensity requirements as the
parent’s output industry, possibly because similarity of skills is important for facilitating the transfer
of intangible assets from parents to subsidiaries. It is thus reassuring that despite controlling (albeit
imperfectly) for these additional motives behind firm boundary choices, we continue to find evidence
supporting the subtle predictions of our model on how upstreamness affects integration patterns.
As a final exercise, we empirically assess prediction P.2 (Within). For this, we include interactions between the elasticity quintiles ρj and Contractibility-up-to-iij , where the latter variable
captures the contractibility of all inputs up to i in the production of j:

Recall that Contractibility-up-to-iij was constructed in (18) as an empirical proxy for

from the model. Looking back at the expression for the optimal bargaining share, β ∗ (m), in
equation (10), one would then expect that Contractibility-up-to-iij would raise the propensity to
integrate input i if industry j came under the complements case, while having the opposite effect
in the substitutes case. This would lead us to expect that γ 1 < 0 and γ 5 > 0, although finding that
γ 5 > γ 1 > 0 would be consistent with the weaker statement in prediction P.2 (Within).
The results from estimating (25) are reported in Table 8. As in Table 7, we begin by reporting
a parsimonious specification in which we only include the interactions between Contractibility-upto-iij and the demand elasticity quintiles, the self-SIC dummy, and log trij (column (1)). While
100 manufacturing inputs, but the correlations are similar if all top-100 manufacturing inputs are included. There is
thus a tendency for inputs that exhibit weaker complementarities in either procurement or marketing/distribution to
be located more upstream relative to the final-good industry. This accounts for why the Upstreamnessij interaction
coefficients either move into less negative or more positive terrain once the effects of upstream- and downstreamcomplementarities are directly controlled for in column (2), Table 7.
38
We have also run regressions in which we substituted the elasticity quintiles in (24) with the dummy variable
1(ρj > ρmed ). The coefficients of the interactions between this dummy and Upstreamnessij were never significant.
This is not surprising, given that the differential effects are concentrated in the first and fifth quintiles.

Notes: The dependent variable is a 0-1 indicator for whether the SIC input is integrated. Each observation is a SIC input by parent
firm pair, where the set of parent firms comprise those with primary SIC industry in manufacturing and employment of at least 20,
which have integrated at least one manufacturing input apart from the output self-SIC. The sample is restricted to the set of the top 100
ever-integrated manufacturing inputs, as ranked by the total requirements coefficients of the SIC output industry. The Contractibilityup-to-iij measure is the share of the total-requirements weighted contractibility of inputs that has been accrued in production upstream
of and including input i in the production of output j. The quintile dummies in columns (1)-(5) are based on the elasticity measure
constructed using only those HS10 elasticities from Broda and Weinstein (2006) classified as consumption goods in the UN BEC; column
(6) uses the consumption-goods-only demand elasticity minus a proxy for α to distinguish between the complements and substitutes
cases. All columns include parent firm fixed effects, while columns (5) and (6) also include SIC input industry fixed effects. Standard
errors are clustered by input-output industry pair; ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively.

45

the interactions with Contractibility-up-to-iij all yield positive coefficients, the magnitude of these
coefficients is largest in the highest elasticity quintile. (The difference between the first and fifth
quintile coefficients is statistically significant; see the p-value at the bottom of the table.) The
results obtained are similar when controlling for the additional industry-pair variables related to
the proximity of industries (columns (2)-(4)), controlling for input industry fixed effects (column
(5)), as well as when using the proxy of αj to refine the demand elasticity quintiles (column (6)).
Consistent with prediction P.2 (Within) of our model, the findings of Table 8 thus show that a
greater contractibility of inputs upstream of i increases the propensity to integrate input i more
for firms facing a higher elasticity of demand for their final product.39
We have performed a series of additional estimations to verify the robustness of the within-firm
results. These are reported and discussed in more detail in Section A-3 of the Online Appendix.
Tables A-11 and A-12 in that Appendix confirm the robustness of our results concerning respectively
the role of upstreamness and the role of contractibility in shaping integration decisions along the
value chain, when we restrict the sample to different subsets of firms (single-establishment firms,
domestic firms, and multinationals). Tables A-13 and A-14 show that our results are similar if
we: (i) drop parent firms that do not have an integrated input (apart from the self-SIC) among
the top-100 manufacturing inputs as ranked by total requirements value; (ii) focus on parents that
have integrated at least three of their top-100 manufacturing inputs; (iii) drop the self-SIC from the
estimation; and (iv) include all top-100 manufacturing inputs (instead of focusing on the subset of
ever-integrated inputs). In Table A-14, we also show that the estimated effects of Contractibilityup-to-iij are robust to controlling for a measure of the contractibility of input i itself.

Conclusion

The rapid growth of global value chains in recent decades has attracted much attention from
policymakers and academics alike. However, there are currently few systematic empirical studies
attempting to shed light on the determinants of firms’ decisions to control different segments of
their production processes. In this paper, we show how detailed data on the activities of firms
around the world can be combined with information from standard Input-Output tables to study
such integration choices along value chains.
Building on Antràs and Chor (2013), we describe a property-rights model in which a firm’s
boundaries are shaped by characteristics of the different stages of production and their position
along the value chain. As available theoretical frameworks of sequential production are highly
stylized, a key contribution of this paper is to develop a richer theoretical framework of firm behavior
that can guide an empirical analysis using firm-level data. Our model delivers several testable
predictions, suggesting that the propensity to integrate upstream versus downstream inputs should
depend crucially on the elasticity of demand for the final product, the degree of contractibility
39

Note that the inclusion of the Upstream-Complementarityij and Downstream-Complementarityij measures even
leads to a negative (though insignificant) point estimate for the interaction term of interest in the first elasticity
quintile, which would be in line with the stronger form of our theoretical predictions.

of the inputs, and the productivity of the parent firm. One of our model’s extensions also helps
to rationalize the sparsity of integrated inputs, showing that low levels of intrafirm trade can be
consistent with the property-rights approach to firm boundaries, in which final good producers
choose to own suppliers to better discipline their behavior.
To assess the evidence, we use the WorldBase dataset, which contains establishment-level information on the activities of firms located in a large set of countries. We combine this information
with Input-Output tables to construct firm-level measures of the upstreamness of integrated and
non-integrated stages. The richness of our data allows us to run specifications that exploit variation
in organizational features across firms, as well as within firms and across their various manufacturing stages. In line with our model’s predictions, we find that whether a firm integrates suppliers
located upstream or downstream depends crucially on the elasticity of demand faced by the firm.
Moreover, the relative propensity to integrate upstream (as opposed to downstream) inputs depends on the extent to which contractible inputs tend to be located in the early or late stages of
the production process, as well as on the productivity of final good producers. The firm-level patterns that we uncover provide strong evidence that considerations driven by contractual frictions
critically shape firms’ ownership decisions along their value chains.
Although we have interpreted our empirical findings as being supportive of the relevance of
a property-rights model of firm boundaries in a sequential production environment, they could
in principle be consistent with alternative theories. The key features of our model that generate
predictions in line with the patterns observed in the data are as follows: (i) relative to integration,
non-integration is associated with higher-powered incentives for suppliers; (ii) variation in the demand elasticity affects the relative importance of eliciting high effort or investments in upstream
versus downstream stages; and (iii) higher contractibility is associated with less inefficient investments. As argued by Tadelis and Willamson (2013), one could envision transaction-cost models
of firm boundaries satisfying properties (i) and (iii), which coupled with our model of sequential
production would also produce feature (ii). In addition, when discussing our empirical results
(specifically, the within-firm regressions) we have highlighted some patterns that are consistent
with alternative theories (e.g., Atalay et al., 2014) advocating that common ownership allows firms
to efficiently move intangible inputs across their production units.
